                "text": "A year ago, buying a Starbucks coffee didn\u2019t feel \u201creal\u201d to Samantha Thomas. \u201cIt was just tapping,\u201d the 41-year-old private tutor from Wigan says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like real money, it was just my card.\u201d Nowadays, Thomas pulls out a \u00a35 note every time she wants a hot drink. \u201cWhen you\u2019re physically handing over solid money,\u201d she says, \u201cit just makes you think twice.\u201d\n\nFor the last 12 months, Thomas has been a cash-only consumer. She leaves her debit card at home when she does her weekly food shop, bringing only the budget she has allocated in notes. As a result, Thomas could \u201csit here and tell you to the penny\u201d what most items in the supermarket cost. \u201cI know that if I go to Aldi something would cost me 6p less than if I went to Asda and about 5p less than if I went to Tesco,\u201d she says. Thomas\u2019s \u201csolid money\u201d habit hasn\u2019t just changed her attitude to Starbucks; it\u2019s changed the way she spends and saves entirely.\n\nResearch shows that we experience the \u2018pain of paying\u2019 when spending cash. Photograph: georgeclerk/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nThomas is not the only one turning to cash during the cost of living crisis. In July, more than \u00a3800m in banknotes was withdrawn from Post Office counters, a 20% rise from the same month the year before. Martin Kearsley, banking director at the Post Office, told the BBC: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more people increasingly reliant on cash as the tried-and-tested way to manage a budget.\u201d\n\nSince records began five years ago, Post Office withdrawals have exceeded \u00a3800m only once before \u2013 and that was last Christmas, a time when a lot of cash is tucked into cards. Shortly after UK wages fell at their fastest rate in 20 years, Kearsley said it was clear that Britain is \u201canything but a cashless society\u201d.\n\nThomas first ditched her debit card post-lockdown after she was troubled by her online spending during the pandemic, but she says her cash-only budget is helping her to prepare for rising costs. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m ahead of the game, I feel like I\u2019ve got an advantage,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be tricky, but I feel like I\u2019ve already got lots of tools in place to help me.\u201d\n\nContactless promotes increased spending and increased use of debt Warwick business school\n\nPersonal finance and consumer expert Sue Hayward concurs that \u201chanding over cold hard cash often makes you think twice about how much you\u2019re spending\u201d. She also notes that it\u2019s easier to keep track of purchases when paying with banknotes, \u201cas contactless payments can take several days to show up on your statement\u201d.\n\nIn 2020, researchers from Warwick business school analysed more than 300m transactions from 260,000 consumers and found that people with contactless cards spent \u201csignificantly more\u201d than those without. Contactless spenders were also more likely to be charged overdraft fees and made more purchases overall. The researchers concluded that contactless: \u201cpromotes increased spending and can promote decreased cash usage and increased use of debt.\u201d\n\nConversely, almost 30 years of academic research have shown that we experience the \u201cpain of paying\u201d when spending cash: handing over money feels like losing it, activating the insular cortex, the part of our brain that deals with physical pain. (Interestingly, it seems that some alternatives to cash are less painful than others. One 2018 paper, from the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, found that consumers feel lower levels of pain when they pay with mobile phones and smartwatches than when they use credit cards.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just being savvy and going back to old-school ways,\u201d Thomas says of her cash use. On her YouTube channel, The Budget Mum UK, she shows her 2,600 subscribers how she withdraws her wage at the start of the month and separates the notes into different laminated envelopes. Among others, there\u2019s an envelope for food shopping, one for travel, one for credit card debt and one for emergencies.\n\nOld-style budgeting \u2026 \u2018cash stuffing\u2019 involves setting aside money in envelopes, one for each expense. Photograph: FotoDuets/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nOn social media, this budgeting technique is called \u201ccash stuffing\u201d: the envelopes help people keep track of their spending and saving without complicated spreadsheets. Google searches for the technique spiked at the beginning of the year, and TikTok videos hashtagged #cashstuffing have now accumulated almost 550m views.\n\nJade Edmondson is a 29-year-old teaching assistant from Coventry who sells cash-stuffing materials such as labelled plastic envelopes, binders and savings tracking sheets on her Etsy page. She says she has seen a recent rise in sales. In total, Edmondson personally uses 30 cash-stuffing envelopes for things such as petrol money, Christmas savings and her Slimming World membership. Putting away money gradually in one envelope over the course of the year helps Edmondson save for bigger costs: she now has \u00a3350 saved to buy her four children\u2019s school uniforms. \u201cIf this was me last year, I would be panicking: \u2018How am I going to pay for all of this?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cWhereas actually now, I don\u2019t worry about money.\u201d\n\nYet a cash-only lifestyle can cause problems in an increasingly cashless society. In 2010, half of the UK\u2019s transactional payments were made in cash, but by 2020, this had dropped to just 17%. A number of shops banned cash payments for public health reasons during the pandemic, but a 2021 survey by Which? found that one in five consumers had been prevented from making a cash payment between April and July of 2021, when restrictions were easing.\n\nThe reality is you will pay more using cash because you can\u2019t shop online Natalie Cenney\n\nThomas has run into trouble when paying for petrol \u2013 and when she sent her daughter to the cinema with cash recently, she was unable to buy her ticket and snacks. \u201cIt\u2019s just been trial and error,\u201d she says. Six weeks ago, she decided to set up Apple Pay on her phone as a backup for emergencies, but she refuses to leave her credit card in her car to avoid temptation.\n\nNatalie Ceeney, chair of the Cash Action Group, says many small businesses don\u2019t accept cash because it\u2019s increasingly difficult to deposit takings due to the closure of high street banks. Ceeney is now campaigning to get ATMs to take cash deposits (you can currently do this inside banks, but opening hours can be prohibitive). However, she says, \u201csetting up a whole new network\u201d is \u201cnot quick\u201d. Meanwhile, Ceeney notes that many consumers depend on cash due to \u201csome form of vulnerability\u201d, such as not having a proper internet connection, smartphone or bank account, or having a disability. A May study by the Royal Society of Arts found that 15 million people in the UK rely on cash to budget.\n\n\u201cThe main reason people will tell you they use cash is for budgeting: you can see it, you can feel it,\u201d Ceeney says. \u201cWith the cost of living crisis, more people are strapped for cash so it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that people are going back to using cash, withdrawing money to get through the week safely without getting overdrawn.\u201d\n\nAlthough cash can have its advantages, Ceeney warns that there\u2019s a \u201cpoverty premium\u201d when avoiding cards. \u201cThe reality is, if you can\u2019t shop online you will pay more using cash because you can\u2019t get online deals or direct debits where you often get a discount, you can\u2019t shop around or buy in bulk,\u201d she says. Ceeney explains that although many families know this, they\u2019re \u201cgoing back to cash because they can\u2019t afford to go overdrawn \u2013 this is about necessity\u201d.\n\nEven with cash-stuffing systems in place, Thomas and Edmondson are concerned about the ever-increasing cost of living. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s going to be a big hurdle,\u201d Thomas says of rising bills, while Edmondson adds: \u201cIt\u2019s still very nerve-racking. It\u2019s like: \u2018Where are we going to find this extra money from?\u2019\u201d While using cash can be helpful for individual consumers, it is not a substitute for government intervention, nor a long-term solution to our economic crisis. With food prices rising at their fastest pace in 14 years and annual energy bills expected to cost two months\u2019 worth of wages next year, coins can only go so far.\n\nAdditional reporting by Rachel Hall",

                "text": "Britain\u2019s first double-digit inflation in more than four decades has cast doubts on the plausibility of the tax cuts being promised by Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak during their leadership battle, one of the UK\u2019s leading thinktanks has said.\n\nFollowing news that the government\u2019s preferred measure of the cost of living rose by 10.1% in the year to July, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said higher inflation would mean extra spending on welfare benefits, state pensions and on debt interest.\n\nThe result of inflation being five times higher than a year earlier would be weaker public finances, making it harder for either of the two hopefuls to replace Boris Johnson to make good on their tax pledges, the IFS said.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sunak has said he would cut taxes but only when inflation is back under control.\n\nBut the IFS said in the next financial year \u2013 2023\u201324 \u2013 borrowing was likely to increase by \u00a323bn, because the government would need to uprate benefits and pensions in line with a higher inflation rate at a cost of \u00a34bn and also pay \u00a354bn in higher debt interest on inflation-linked bonds. The spending increases would only be partly offset by a \u00a334bn increase in tax revenues as a result of rising inflation.\n\nThe thinktank said there would be additional pressures, probably running into tens of billions of pounds, to continue to support households struggling with higher energy bills and to compensate public services for the impact of higher than expected inflation.\n\nIn a new report published today, the IFS said Truss and Sunak needed to recognise the even greater than usual uncertainty in the public finances. Pressures on public services would be more acute, higher spending than planned looked \u201cinevitable\u201d and tax revenues would depend on the length and depth of the recession being forecast by Threadneedle Street.\n\nThe thinktank said additional public borrowing in the short term was not necessarily a problem \u2013 and might be appropriate to fund targeted support, but large permanent tax cuts on the scale being mooted during the Tory party\u2019s hustings would exacerbate \u201calready substantial pressures\u201d on the public finances unless matching spending cuts were also implemented. In reality, \u201csignificant\u201d spending increases were likely to be needed in face of high inflation, it added.\n\nCarl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS and an author of the report, said: \u201cThe reality is that the UK has got poorer over the last year. That makes tax and spending decisions all the more difficult. It is hard to square the promises that both Ms Truss and Mr Sunak are making to cut taxes over the medium-term with the absence of any specific measures to cut public spending and a presumed desire to manage the nation\u2019s finances responsibly.\u201d\n\nSunak\u2019s campaign responded saying the IFS analysis \u201cdrives a coach and horses\u201d through his rival\u2019s proposals, and that he has \u201cconsistently made the case that permanent, unfunded tax cuts would cause significant damage to the public finances and push inflation up higher\u201d.\n\nThe Bank of England expects inflation to fall sharply next year after peaking at more than 13% in October.",

You need not be an economist to know how much prices have been going up this year, from the petrol pump to the supermarket checkout to direct debits. And while inflation at 10% is a remarkable figure, it is set to go even higher. Unless the government acts on energy bills, when the cap rises by a predicted 80% on 1 October, inflation will soar again. Analysts expect prices for gas and electricity to keep on increasing well into the new year. And where energy prices go, so go the costs for everything else, from food to clothes to transport.\n\nThe UK is not the only country in this mess, but its position is the most precarious of any in the rich world. Privatisation means that the British government has little control over the prices set by its utilities (unlike, say, Emmanuel Macron with EDF), while workers in the UK have far less bargaining power than their counterparts in France and Germany. Then there is Brexit, plus the long-held assumption by politicians and economists that the UK need neither own nor manufacture much of what it consumes \u2013 it can just buy it all in. The result is that inflation in the UK far outstrips that in the US, Japan, Germany or France \u2013 and financial markets expect that to remain so next year.\n\nEven before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, 2022 was set to be shaped by the cost of living. Ahead of this autumn, three things can be said with reasonable confidence. First, the Bank of England will keep raising rates \u2013 and most likely induce a recession that will harm firms and workers. Threadneedle Street will treat this week\u2019s signs of prices rising in the service sector as proof that inflation is no longer being imported, but is now settling into our economy. Second, the next prime minister will not have the war chest they hoped for. This March, the Office for Budget Responsibility calculated that the Conservative government had \u00a330bn of \u201cfiscal headroom\u201d to cut taxes and raise spending. Most of that will now go on pensions, social security and interest on public debt. Throughout this Tory leadership campaign, economics has been discussed as if in some strange blue-rinse bubble: giveaways today, or tomorrow? That bubble is heading towards a painfully sharp pin.\n\nFinally, the Conservatives are engineering an almighty clash with trade unions. Public sector workers are the ones seeing their pay fall furthest behind their bills, after more than a decade of real-terms cuts to wages, and are also most likely to be unionised. The government is well aware of this, yet has done little to alleviate the real suffering being felt by nurses and teachers and other vital workers. The obvious conclusion to be drawn is ministers want a fight. If so, they won\u2019t be disappointed. Given the battle readiness of union leaders such as Sharon Graham, this will most probably be a winter dominated by industrial strife.\n\nIt is worth recalling how much of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s project focused on suppressing prices by hammering down on workers. In that, if not much else, she was strikingly successful. And over the intervening decades Westminster has been filleted of a sense of class conflict. Politics became, as David Hare titled one of his best plays, the absence of war. Not for much longer.",

Motor vehicle and parts dealers sales also fell sharply, declining 1.6%.\n\nGas prices had eclipsed $5 a gallon in many locations earlier in the summer, but fell through July and most recently were at $3.94 a gallon for regular unleaded, according to AAA.\n\n\"People appear to have used some of the savings from lower gas prices to spend more on other items, both in nominal and \u2014 very likely \u2014 real terms,\" wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \"Auto sales have been severely constrained by the chip shortage, so pent-up demand likely is substantial. July's other losers were department stores and clothing retailers, but all these components are noisy and subject to revisions.\"\n\nThose pullbacks in gas and auto sales were offset by a 2.7% increase in online sales and a 1.5% gain in miscellaneous stores.\n\nConsumers have been fighting to keep up with an inflationary environment that has seen prices overall increase 8.5% from a year ago, close to the highest level in 40 years. Price rises have been especially pernicious in the food and energy category; even with the July slide in energy prices, gas station receipts climbed 39.9% from a year ago.\n\nJuly provided some respite from inflation pressures, and the decline in fuel costs particularly allowed consumers to spend elsewhere.\n\nFood sales rose just 0.2%, however, even as the food price index as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics increased 1.1% for the month. Sales at bars and restaurants also struggled, rising just 0.1%.\n\nSome retailers also have struggled in the current environment.\n\nTarget on Wednesday said its earnings tumbled close to 90% from a year ago as it has had to mark down prices on unwanted inventory.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been using interest rate increases to hold back inflation. The central bank enacted consecutive 0.75 percentage point hikes in June and July and is expected to keep moving rates higher until inflation comes down to the Fed's 2% goal.\n\nCorrection: Target on Wednesday said its earnings tumbled close to 90% from a year ago. An earlier version misstated the metric.",

What's happening in reality, is chaos.\"\n\nThe founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media, a production company and marketing consultancy, added, \"You're the only one watching your own back and your own assets, people are spending time protecting themselves by setting up so many different wallets and protecting their identity and that's not contributing to development in the area.\" Zuckerberg, who was an early employee at Meta \u2014 formerly known as Facebook \u2014 explained that various metaverses are now acting as \"their own walled garden,\" in which users are unable to use their assets across platforms. The metaverse can be loosely defined as a virtual world where people live, work and play. With cryptocurrency, users can buy and develop virtual land or dress their own avatars.\n\n\"Right now, I'm on Decentraland, my son is on Roblox, my other son is on Fortnite. That's great \u2014 we're all in the metaverse. [But] we have no interaction with one another,\" she said. \"In order to really unlock the potential [of Web3], we're going to need to figure out a system where there's interoperability. What you have goes with you wherever you are, [and] we're not there yet,\" Zuckerberg added.\n\nGoing mainstream\n\nHowever, according to Zuckerberg, that's easier said than done because no company running a metaverse right now wants to give up control or \"share that ownership.\" \"That's why it's not we're not seeing that kind of consumer mainstream adoption yet because there needs to be a world where you leave the house with one wallet. And you need to see that same behavior online also.\" She added that Web3 needs experts who have been involved in the global banking system and Web2 \u2014 the internet that we know today \u2014 to lend a \"protective layer.\"\n\nThe need for such experts is all the more important because it has been \"too easy\" for users to be scammed or lose all their assets in Web3, said Zuckerberg. \"There needs to be more protections for consumers \u2026 I think we will wind up [with] web 2.7, where there is some centralization, keeping people safe, but the ability to port your assets with you to any site.\" Another thing that needs to be improved in Web3 is user-friendliness, she added. \"It should not take 45 steps to set up a cryptocurrency wallet, buy a currency and enter the metaverse. It needs to [be] one-stop, beginner-friendly.\"\n\nSectors with opportunities",

If you\u2019re less wealthy than Jacob Rees-Mogg, the party has fought a 12-year war against you, and \u2013 newsflash \u2013 it won.\n\nSome statistics need animating, and some animate themselves. We do not need a human-interest case study to understand what a 40-year high of 10.1% inflation feels like. We don\u2019t need a pessimistic temperament to be terrified of what October will look like, when it\u2019s slated to reach 13% and the choice between heating and eating kicks in for so many people. We don\u2019t need an infographic to get to grips with the official figures that show a 4.1% drop in regular pay. But news that the Dogs Trust, for the first time in its history, has a waiting list for taking in people\u2019s pets still takes your breath away. I\u2019m emphatically not saying that dogs are more important than people \u2013 I\u2019m merely pointing out that this government has brought us to a point where we can\u2019t afford to feed our best friends. This isn\u2019t a belt-tightening moment; this is a wake-up moment.\n\nIn fact, the class war wasn\u2019t fought with subtlety and skill, it was fought in a more modern fashion, with misinformation. The argument for austerity was built on complementary, nonsensical narratives: most disabled people were faking it; most people on benefits were too lazy to work; most waste in the benefits system was lost to fraud; a class of the workshy had been created by benefits; the \u201cbig society\u201d was good, because it was much nicer to get your neighbour\u2019s help than to have properly funded public services; parents know more about education than local authorities; and so on.\n\nOpponents of this Cameron-era inanity dignified it by arguing against these propositions as though he actually meant them. What if libraries were mainly used by middle-class children? What if nurses did have to take a pay cut, or we\u2019d soon become Greece? It was just one diversionary talking point after another, as the first offensive wave proceeded completely without mishap, and the destruction of the social safety net was achieved.\n\nWith Brexit, at least we were arguing about something real: what happened in relation to Europe mattered, for our prosperity, for our intellectual life, for our rights, for the union, for the climate. But again, we were arguing from a completely false start, as if the two competing sides were legitimately different visions for Britain, one which wanted to take back control, one which didn\u2019t. In fact, the escapade was there to deliver only one outcome: the destruction of regulation by which workers and citizens protect and assert themselves against the interests of capital. It was just the second wave of the war.\n\nLiz Truss and Rishi Sunak, prime ministerial hopefuls, approach the coming crisis with another patchwork of absolute nonsense. The cost of living crisis is all down to the war in Ukraine. We head into recession because we don\u2019t work hard enough. It\u2019s all the fault of the unions, or the woke, who are coming for our growth and \u201cour women\u201d (respectively). Britain can go from strength to strength if the person in charge is enthusiastic enough (according to Truss). This time it\u2019s different \u2013 these lines are so incredibly weak and thin, it\u2019s like reaching the end of the road in a Russian misinformation campaign, where they can no longer afford any tech whizzes and they\u2019re leaving meme creation to bots and Google translate.\n\nBut it\u2019s different for a more important reason: they\u2019re not trying to divert us from some smart new move \u2013 they have no moves. If you look at the level of public debt, the high inflation, the low growth and the tax burden, we\u2019re already in a postwar economy. It was just a different kind of war, a class war masquerading as a kulturkampf, and we lost. Sorry to labour the point, but until we acknowledge the extent of the devastation and its cause we cannot hope to recover our bearings.\n\nYou cannot rebuild anything on fictional foundations. There is no meaningful way out of this if we pretend it\u2019s all about global headwinds and we\u2019re a nice nation that can pull together. You cannot organise if you don\u2019t know what side you\u2019re on, and so many of the narratives of the past 12 years have been tailored to mask exactly that. Are you a striver or a shirker? A net contributor or a net recipient? A patriot or a migrant? Metropolitan elite or left behind? Latte sipper or bitter drinker? Woke or anti-woke? Leaver or remainer? We\u2019ve been trapped in this endless cycle of meaningless divisions to mask what\u2019s incredibly plain: we\u2019re all on the same side and we\u2019re all under attack.",

Kent Nishimura | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Reserve's path to bringing down runaway inflation while keeping the economy from slipping into a major downturn is still open but is getting narrower, according to Goldman Sachs. As the central bank looks to keep raising interest rates, the economy is teeming with mixed signals: rapidly rising payroll figures against sharply declining housing numbers, falling gasoline prices vs. surging shelter and food costs, and low consumer sentiment against steady spending numbers. Amid it all, the Fed is trying to strike a balance between slowing things down, but not by too much. On that score, Goldman economists think there have been clear wins, some losses and a landscape ahead that poses substantial challenges. \"Our broad conclusion is that there is a feasible but difficult path to a soft landing, though several factors beyond the Fed's control can ease or complicate that path and raise or lower the odds of success,\" Goldman economist David Mericle said in a client note Sunday.\n\nSlow growth, high inflation\n\nOne of the biggest inflation drivers has been outsized growth that has created imbalances between supply and demand. The Fed is using interest rate increases to try to damp down demand so supply can catch up, and supply chain pressures, as measured by a New York Fed index, are at their lowest since January 2021. So on that score, Mericle said the Fed's efforts have \"gone well.\" He said the rate increases \u2014 totaling 2.25 percentage points since March \u2014 have \"achieved a much-need deceleration\" regarding growth and specifically demand. In fact, Goldman expects GDP to grow at just a 1% pace over the next four quarters, and that's coming off consecutive declines of 1.6% and 0.9%. Though most economists expect that the National Bureau of Economic Research will not declare the U.S. in recession for the first half of the year, the slow-growth path makes the Fed's balancing act more difficult. On a similar count, Mericle said the Fed's moves have helped narrow the supply-demand gap in the labor market, where there are still nearly two job openings for every available worker. That effort \"has a long way to go,\" he wrote. However, the biggest problem remains stubbornly high inflation. The consumer price index was flat in July but still rose 8.5% from a year ago. Wages are surging at a strong clip, with average hourly earnings up 5.2% from a year ago. Consequently, the Fed's efforts to halt a spiral in which higher prices feed higher wages and perpetuate inflation have \"shown little convincing progress so far,\" Mericle said. \"The bad news is that high inflation is broad-based, measures of the underlying trend are elevated, and business inflation expectations and pricing intentions remain high,\" he added.\n\nDoubts about the Fed's policy path\n\nFighting inflation might require higher rate hikes than the market currently anticipates. Goldman's projection is that the Fed raises benchmark rates by another percentage point before the end of the year, but Mericle acknowledged that there is \"upside risk\" due to \"the recent easing in financial conditions, the robust pace of hiring, and signs of stickiness in wage growth and inflation.\" Indeed, former New York Fed President William Dudley said Monday he thinks the market is underestimating the future path of rate hikes and, consequently, the risks of a hard landing or recession.",

                "text": "Analysts generally expect state-owned enterprises will perform better than non-state-owned developers in the latest real estate slump. Pictured here in Guangxi, China, on Aug. 15, 2022, is a real estate complex developed by state-owned conglomerate Poly Group. Future Publishing | Future Publishing | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Chinese property developers' cash flows \u2014 a sign of the companies' ability to stay afloat \u2014 shrank this year after steady growth over the last decade, according to Oxford Economics. Developer cash flows through July are down 24% year-on-year on an annualized basis, according to analysis from the firm's lead economist, Tommy Wu. That's a sharp slowdown from growth for nearly every year since at least 2009, the data showed. Total funding as of July was 15.22 trillion yuan ($2.27 trillion) on an annualized basis, versus 20.11 trillion yuan in 2021. The drop comes as credit demand in China missed expectations in July, and property developers' struggles drag on. About two years ago, Beijing started to crack down on developers' high reliance on debt for growth. Notably, Evergrande defaulted late last year. Other developers like Shimao have also defaulted, despite appearing to have healthier balance sheets.\n\nWhile investors have turned cautious on Chinese property companies, developers now face the risk of losing another important source of cash flow: homebuyer pre-payments.\n\nHomes are typically sold ahead of completion in China. But since late June, some homebuyers have protested apartment construction delays by halting mortgage payments. \"The crux of the problem is that property developers have insufficient cash flows \u2013 whether because of debt-servicing costs, low housing sales, or misuse of funds \u2013 to continue with projects,\" Wu said in a report last week. \"Resolving this problem will rebuild homebuyers' confidence in developers, which will help support housing sales and, in turn, improve developers' financial health.\" More than $2 billion in high-yield property developer debt is due in September \u2014 that's more than two times that of August, according to Morgan Stanley's analysis as of Aug. 10. About a quarter of homebuyers who bought property ahead of their completion are inclined to stop their mortgage payments if construction is suspended, the U.S. investment bank said in an Aug. 15 report, citing a proprietary AlphaWise Consumer Survey. Not only does real estate account for the bulk of household wealth in China, but analysts estimate property and industries related to real estate account for more than a quarter of China's GDP. The real estate slump has contributed to an overall slowdown in economic growth this year.\n\nIn an effort to support growth, the People's Bank of China has cut rates, including an unexpected cut on Monday of 10 basis points to some one-year interest rates for institutions, known as the medium-term lending facility. While the PBOC may hope the cut could ease some of homebuyers' burden and help developers get loans, the problem isn't just about funding, said Bruce Pang, chief economist and head of research for Greater China at JLL. He noted how developers have found it harder to obtain funding on their own, and have had to rely more on pre-sales to homebuyers. But people are increasingly cautious about buying new homes due to their expectations for future employment and returns on existing investment products, he added. Despite multiple reports of government plans to keep developers funded, the central government has yet to officially announce broader support for real estate. A readout of a high-level government meeting last month said local governments are responsible for delivering completed houses. Among three major sources of developer funding, advance payments and deposits have fallen the most this year, down by 34%, according to Wu's analysis. Credit as a source of funding dropped by 22%, while self-raised capital, including stocks and bonds, was down by 17%, the annualized data showed.\n\nInvestors turn away from China property\n\nInvestment funds have largely stayed away from Chinese property developers, reducing a potential source of funding. \"What has been worrying has been the lack of willingness and speed by top policymakers in resolving real estate developer's funding issues,\" Carol Lye, assistant portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, said in an emailed response to CNBC. Lye said the investment management firm's allocation to China real estate is low, and that Brandywine holds \"high quality real estate bonds that have been given preference in terms of government support.\" Some investors have even turned to companies in other parts of Asia. \"We've exited almost all of our holdings in China residential. It's more a wait-and-see game in terms of getting back exposure,\" said Xin Yan Low, Singapore-based portfolio manager for Asia property equities at Janus Henderson. She declined to share a timeframe of those sales. \"There are still many alternatives in the region, especially with reopening now, Singapore, Australia, basically back to full reopening, fundamentals are strong,\" she said. Top holdings in her co-managed Horizon Asia-Pacific Property Income Fund include Japan Metropolitan Fund Invest, Mapletree Logistics Trust and Hang Lung Properties.\n\nRead more about China from CNBC Pro JPMorgan says buy this undervalued Chinese biopharma stock that can rally more than 40% from here",

                "text": "It will doubtless come as a surprise to British workers toiling in distribution warehouses, call centres or the NHS that Liz Truss thinks they could do with showing \u201cmore graft\u201d.\n\nJudging by comments made when she was chief secretary to the Treasury, the frontrunner to be prime minister thinks the UK\u2019s economic problems are down to a working culture quite different from that in communist China.\n\nTruss is right in one respect. The UK does lag behind many other western countries in the productivity league table. Across the G7 group of major industrial countries, the average worker produces 13% more an hour than the average British worker and the gap is getting bigger.\n\nOfficial data also appears to show a divide between London and the rest of the country, with workers in the capital apparently 80% more productive than the national average. Truss suggests this is a mindset issue.\n\nThe idea, though, that the UK\u2019s deep-rooted economic problems are caused by shirking or a lack of effort does not stand up to serious scrutiny. Britain has one of the most deregulated labour markets in the developed world and the average British worker puts in more hours a week than the European average.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is a country where management has the whip hand and, for the most part, workers are not protected by unions. To the extent Truss\u2019s analysis was ever true, it harks back to a labour market that has long since disappeared \u2013 now replaced by one in which an army of gig economy and self-employed workers toil away to make a living.\n\nThe real reason for Britain\u2019s poor productivity lies elsewhere. UK business investment as a share of national output, or gross domestic product, is the lowest in the G7. It is a similar story with research and development, to which the UK devotes 1.7% of GDP annually, compared with an average of 3.1% for members of the developed country club, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nBritain\u2019s economic model is based on an abundance of cheap labour and under-investment in up to date capital equipment and product innovation. Skills levels are higher in a country such as Germany because the Germans invest more in training.\n\nThe difference between Britain and better performing countries is not that they work harder than we do, but that they work smarter than we do. Foreign-owned companies in the UK tend to have higher productivity, so if \u201cmindset\u201d is the issue then it is the mindset of management that counts.\n\nNor is it really the case that productivity is higher in London because workers in the capital have a \u201ccan do\u201d spirit lacking elsewhere. As a paper from researchers at Sheffield Hallam University found, once adjusted for factors including the size of the working age population, the concentration of high productivity jobs in finance and the number of hours worked, the gap virtually disappears.\n\nTruss\u2019s team say the remarks made some years ago have been taken out of context but they seem pretty clear. If Boris Johnson\u2019s probable successor thinks more graft is needed, she is completely misdiagnosing the problem.",

Real-time market rent trackers that reported prices shooting up in Sun Belt cities last year are now showing bigger increases in places like New York, San Jose and Seattle.\n\nInflation F.A.Q. Card 1 of 5 Inflation F.A.Q. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. Inflation F.A.Q. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Inflation F.A.Q. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. Inflation F.A.Q. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Inflation F.A.Q. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose market rent increases take time to trickle into official inflation figures because of the way the government calculates its data. Much as Phoenix\u2019s official inflation numbers are surging now partly because of the run-up in market rents in 2021, nascent increases in big coastal cities could keep pressure on inflation in months to come. And the effect could be palpable at a national level: New York and its suburbs account for about 11 percent of the nation\u2019s rental housing-related costs in the Consumer Price Index, compared to about 1 percent for Phoenix.\n\n\u201cEven if we get a slowdown in the Sun Belt, it may not be enough to offset what we\u2019re seeing in other markets,\u201d said Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights.\n\nFederal Reserve officials noted that risk at their July meeting, according to minutes released Wednesday, observing that \u201cin some product categories, the rate of price increase could well pick up further in the short run, with sizable additional increases in residential rental expenses being especially likely.\u201d\n\nThe Fed has been raising interest rates since March to try to slow consumer and business demand and cool inflation and is expected to lift them again at its meeting in September.\n\nTo date, much of the regional divide in price increases \u2014 from rents to consumer goods and services \u2014 has traced back to migration. People have been flocking to less expensive cities from big coastal ones for years, but that trend accelerated sharply with the onset of the pandemic. The pattern is playing out across both the Mountain West, where inflation is also remarkably high, and the Sun Belt.",

The captain of the ship is on shore leave, right, nobody\u2019s in charge at the moment.\u201d\n\nLord Rose, who is a former boss of Marks & Spencer, said action was needed to kill \u201cpernicious\u201d inflation, which he said \u201cerodes wealth over time\u201d. He dismissed claims by the Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss\u2019s camp that it would be possible for the UK to grow its way out of the crisis.\n\nRose told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWe are sitting here now into the second, third, fourth month into this crisis and we\u2019re still waiting to see what action will be taken \u2026 I would like to see us looking after those who need it most.\u201d\n\n\"I don't believe you can grow your way out of inflation\"\n\n\n\nLord Rose, Chairman of ASDA, tells @JustinOnWeb the government must 'kill inflation' before focusing on economic growth. https://t.co/UTmmDpWHD2 | #R4Today pic.twitter.com/I3ovrm8MjH \u2014 BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) August 17, 2022\n\nHe said inflation \u201cpicks on the poorest hardest, but we have to deal with it, we can\u2019t ignore it\u201d. The peer said he believed that interest rates would have to rise further to tackle rising prices, and that the UK was \u201cheading towards a recession\u201d.\n\nRose, who is backing Truss\u2019s rival, Rishi Sunak, to become the next prime minister, criticised the candidates in the Tory leadership race for \u201cthrowing money at everything\u201d.\n\nAs households worry about their energy bills rising even further in October, when the energy price cap is updated, more than 130,000 people have signed a petition backing a call by the former prime minister Gordon Brown for an emergency budget to tackle the energy and cost of living crisis.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Zahawi also denounced Labour\u2019s plan to freeze energy bills, stating it would reward \u201cpeople like me who are at the wealthier end of the spectrum\u201d.\n\nUnison called the cost of living crisis a \u201cliving nightmare for millions of working people\u201d. The union \u2013 which represents more than 1.3 million members providing services in education, local government, the NHS, police service and energy \u2013 is calling for above-inflation pay rises to help workers cope with rocketing prices.\n\n\u201cThe government and those angling to be the next PM appear indifferent to the plight of those struggling to make ends meet,\u201d said Jon Richards, a Unison assistant general secretary. \u201cMinisters are deluded if they think workers can put up with yet more misery.\u201d\n\nThe former Bank of England policymaker Andrew Sentance said pay rises being received by workers could push inflation higher still.\n\n\u201cYou can see what is happening in the labour market, with employees looking to recoup some of the rise in the cost of living through wage increases. If you look at the official figures for wage increases in the private sector, they are running at about 6%. That is way ahead of what is compatible with a 2% inflation target,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\nSentance, now a senior adviser at the consultancy Cambridge Econometrics, said the Bank of England needed to \u201cput a brake\u201d on wage increases, and predicted the Bank could raise interest rates to 4% by the end of the year.",

                "text": "Wholesale prices fell in July for the first time in two years as a plunge in energy prices slowed the pace of inflation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday.\n\nThe producer price index, which gauges the prices received for final demand products, fell 0.5% from June, the first month-over-month decrease since April 2020, the month after Covid-19 was declared a pandemic. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting an increase of 0.2%.\n\nOn an annual basis, the index rose 9.8%, the lowest rate since October 2021. That compares with an 11.3% increase in June and the record 11.7% gain in March.\n\nMost of the decline came from energy, which dropped 9% at the wholesale level and accounted for 80% of the total decline in goods prices, which fell 1.8%. The index for services rose 0.1%.\n\nStripping out food, energy and trade services, PPI increased 0.2% in July, which was less than the expected 0.4% gain. Core PPI rose 5.8% from a year ago.\n\nThe numbers come a day after the consumer price index showed that inflation was flat in July though up 8.5% from a year ago. The easing in the CPI also reflected the slide in energy prices that has seen prices at the pump fall below $4 a gallon after hitting record nominal levels above $5 earlier in the summer.\n\n\"Cooling prices paid by producers portend a further cooling for consumer prices, as producer prices are further up the inflation pipelines,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. \"We expect producer prices to ease as supply chains improve. It could take up to three months for improved supply chains to affect prices for the end consumer.\"\n\nFederal Reserve officials are watching the inflation data closely for clues about where the economy stands after more than a year of wrestling with high inflation.\n\nBefore July's easing, prices had been running at their highest levels in more than 40 years. Supply chain issues, demand imbalances, and high amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus associated with the pandemic had driven the annual CPI rate past 9%, well above the Fed's 2% long-run target.\n\nThis week's data could give the Fed reason to dial back rate increases that have come in successive 0.75 percentage point increments in June and July. Markets are now pricing in a 0.5 percentage point move in September.\n\nA separate Labor Department report Thursday showed that weekly jobless claims totaled 262,000 for the week ended Aug. 6, an increase of 14,000 from the previous week though 2,000 below the estimate.\n\nClaims have been elevated in recent weeks in a sign that a historically tight labor market is shifting. Continuing claims rose 8,000 to 1.43 million.",

Market pricing is for a half-point rate hike at the September meeting, though that remains a close call.\n\nMeeting participants noted that the 2.25%-2.50% range for the federal funds rate was around the \"neutral\" level that is neither supportive nor restrictive on activity. Some officials said a restrictive stance likely will be appropriate, indicating more rate hikes to come.\n\n\"With inflation remaining well above the Committee's objective, participants judged that moving to a restrictive stance of policy was required to meet the Committee's legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability,\" the minutes said.\n\nThe document also reflected the idea that once the Fed gets comfortable with its policy stance and sees it having an impact on inflation, it could start to take its foot off the policy brake. That notion has helped push stocks into a strong summer rally.\n\n\"Participants judged that, as the stance of monetary policy tightened further, it likely would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjustments on economic activity and inflation,\" the minutes said.\n\nHowever, the summary also stated that some participants said \"it likely would be appropriate to maintain that level for some time to ensure that inflation was firmly on a path back to 2 percent.\"",

                "text": "A shopping cart is seen in a supermarket as inflation affected consumer prices in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., June 10, 2022. Andrew Kelly | Reuters\n\nIf inflation has been the biggest threat to U.S. economic growth, then July's data should provide signs that there's at least some relief in the pipeline. Prices were flat for the month as gauged by the items that the Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks for its consumer price index. That marked the first time the aggregate measure hadn't posted a month-over-month increase since May 2020, when the widely followed index showed a modest decline. Just a month ago, CPI posted its fastest 12-month gain since November 1982, following a trend that helped send economic growth into contraction for the first half of the year, stirring up talk of a recession. But with at least the short-term trend indicating the rate of price increases is abating, economic optimism is perking up.\n\nNo recession, for now\n\n\"The whole recession narrative really needs to be put on a shelf for now,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies. \"I think it's going to be shifting to a stronger-for-longer narrative, which is really supported by a reversal in inflation.\" Markowska, whose forecasts this year have been accurate, sees solid growth in the near term, including a 3% growth rate in the third quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow gauge, which tracks economic data in real time, pointed to a 2.5% growth rate in a Wednesday update, up 1.1 percentage points from its last one on Aug. 4. However, Markowska also expects pressures to intensify in 2023, with a recession likely in the back part of the year. Indeed, there was a little bit for both arguments in the CPI report. Most of the tempering in inflation came because of a fall in energy prices. Gasoline slid 7.7%, the biggest monthly decline since April 2020. Fuel oil tumbled 11% as energy-related commodity prices were off 7.6%.\n\nTransportation services cost increases also came off the boil, with airline fares tumbling 7.8% to reverse a trend that has seen tickets surge 27.7% over the past year. But there were few other signs of inflation declines in the report, with food costs particularly high. The food index, in fact, rose 1.1% on the month, and its 10.9% pace over the past 12 months is the highest since May 1979. That's causing worries at places such as City Harvest, which helps feed needy New Yorkers who have been hit especially hard by price surge that began last year. \"We're seeing many more children come into food pantries,\" said Jilly Stephens, the organization's CEO. \"Food insecurity had been intractable even before the pandemic hit. Now we're seeing even more people turn to food pantries because of the rising prices.\" Stephens said the number of children seeking food assistance about doubled a year after the Covid pandemic hit, and the organization is struggling to keep up. \"We're always optimistic, because we are supported by incredibly generous New Yorkers,\" she said.\n\nPeople keep spending",

                "text": "Check out the companies making the biggest moves midday:\n\nTarget \u2014 Shares of the retailer slid more than 2% after its earnings missed Wall Street expectations by a wide margin. The company said its quarterly profit fell almost 90% from a year ago. However, Target reiterated its full-year forecast and said it is now positioned for a rebound.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond \u2014 Shares of the meme stock jumped about 12% on Wednesday, continuing a torrid August rally for the challenged retailer. The stock has seen abnormally high trading volume and is the most popular topic on Reddit page WallStreetBets.\n\nKrispy Kreme \u2014 The doughnut chain slid 12% after it reported quarterly results that included lower-than-expected profit and revenue. The company also said it has seen significant deceleration in commodity costs in recent weeks.\n\nWeber \u2014 Shares of the grill maker dropped more than 7% after Citi downgraded Weber to sell from neutral. The company's weak sales outlook and dwindling cash on hand means that Weber may have to raise additional capital, Citi said.\n\nTeladoc Health \u2014 Shares of Teladoc slipped almost 9% after Guggenheim downgraded the company to sell from neutral. The firm said Teladoc's pace of growth is set to slow in a challenging macroeconomic environment with a weakening consumer.\n\nSanofi \u2014 The French drugmaker hit a 52-week low, with its U.S.-traded shares dropping almost 6%. Sanofi announced Wednesday it discontinued the development of its breast cancer treatment, amcenestrant, after the trial showed no signs that the drug was effective.\n\nAppLovin \u2014 Shares of the tech company dropped more than 7% in midday trading. The company's $20 billion bid for Unity was rejected by Unity's board on Monday. Unity shares were also down nearly 3%.\n\nTake-Two Interactive \u2014 Shares of the software company fell almost 3% after being downgraded by Deutsche Bank to hold from buy. Analysts cited a balanced risk/reward outlook this year and a lack of material near-term catalysts over the next few quarters. However, Deutsche Bank remains constructive on Take-Two Interactive's long-term growth outlook.\n\nAnalog Devices \u2014 Shares dropped almost 5% after CEO Vincent Roche said \"economic uncertainty is beginning to impact bookings\" at the semiconductor company. Otherwise, Analog Devices reported a beat on the top and bottom lines in its calendar second-quarter earnings. Other chip stocks, including Nvidia, Applied Materials and Micron sank about 3% amid the news and Advanced Micro Devices lost almost 2%.\n\nAgilent Technologies \u2014 Shares of Agilent jumped more than 7% after the maker of lab instruments posted better-than-expected profit and revenue for its most recent quarter, according to Refinitiv. The company also raised its full-year forecast due to strong order flow.\n\nTech stocks \u2014 Shares of Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet and Meta Platforms dropped by about 2% after the 10-year Treasury yield moved sharply higher.",

                "text": "The annual inflation rate has burst through the 10% barrier sooner than the financial markets and the Bank of England expected, but the sharp jump in the cost of living last month is not really that much of a shock.\n\nPeriods of double-digit inflation are pretty rare in the UK. In the past 70 years, inflation has been as high as it is currently only three times: during the Korean war in the early 1950s, and after the two oil shocks of the mid- and late 1970s.\n\nNot for 40 years \u2013 since the period immediately before the Falklands war \u2013 has inflation climbed above 10%, but there has been upward pressure on the cost of living since the global economy started to emerge from the pandemic-enforced lockdowns during 2021.\n\nConsistently over the past year, the figure has come in higher than forecast, but it will not merely be the leap in the headline number for the consumer prices index (CPI) \u2013 up from 9.4% in June \u2013 that will be a cause for concern.\n\nFor a start, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said price increases were evident pretty much across the board. The ONS splits the CPI into 12 categories, and in nine of them inflation picked up last month. Food prices rose particularly strongly but there were also increases in clothing and footwear, restaurants and hotels, and recreation and culture.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there is clearly further bad news to come. The price of goods leaving factory gates \u2013 an indication of inflation in the pipeline \u2013 rose by more than 17% in the year to July, the highest rate in 45 years.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Oil prices are well below their peak and that is feeding in \u2013 albeit slowly \u2013 to the prices paid by motorists for petrol and diesel. The war in Ukraine has also prompted many countries to plant more crops to compensate for the lost supply, and while the ONS says the increased production has yet to be reflected in UK shop prices, it thinks it will have an effect over the coming months.\n\nEven so, the annual inflation rate has clearly not yet topped out, and if anything the Bank of England\u2019s forecast of a peak of 13.2% in October may prove optimistic.\n\nThreadneedle Street digs beneath the headline CPI figure to look at measures of core inflation. Here, too, there was bad news. Inflation excluding food, fuel, alcohol and tobacco, stood at 6.2% in July, up from 5.8% in June. The inflation rate for services, which provides a clue to price pressures generated domestically as opposed to global forces, was 5.7% in July, compared with 5.2% in June.\n\nThe strength of headline and underlying inflation makes it more likely that the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee will follow its 0.5 percentage-point increase in interest rates this month with a similar-sized move when it meets again in September.\n\nAt the same time, the risks of a hard landing for the economy have increased because the ever-widening gap between prices and wages is leading to a sharp fall in consumer spending power.\n\nThe ONS reported on Tuesday that regular real wages \u2013 excluding bonuses \u2013 were falling at a record rate of 3% \u2013 but that was based on a different measure of the cost of living to the one used by the government to assess whether its 2% inflation target is being hit.\n\nUsing the government\u2019s preferred measure, real earnings are falling by more than 5% \u2013 unprecedented in modern times.

                "text": "Prices that consumers pay for a variety of goods and services rose 8.5% in July from a year ago, a slowing pace from the previous month due largely to a drop in gasoline prices. On a monthly basis, the consumer price index was flat as energy prices broadly declined 4.6% and gasoline fell 7.7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That offset a 1.1% monthly gain in food prices and a 0.5% increase in shelter costs. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting headline CPI to increase 8.7% on an annual basis and 0.2% monthly.\n\nExcluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core CPI rose 5.9% annually and 0.3% monthly, compared with respective estimates of 6.1% and 0.5%.\n\nEven with the lower-than-expected numbers, inflation pressures remained strong. The jump in the food index put the 12-month increase to 10.9%, the fastest pace since May 1979. Butter is up 26.4% over the past year, eggs have surged 38% and coffee is up more than 20%. Despite the monthly drop in the energy index, electricity prices rose 1.6% and were up 15.2% from a year ago. The energy index rose 32.9% from a year ago. Used vehicle prices posted a 0.4% monthly decline, while apparel prices also fell, easing 0.1%, and transportation services were off 0.5% as airline fares fell 1.8% for the month and 7.8% from a year ago. Markets reacted positively to the report, with futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 400 points and government bond yields down sharply. \"Things are moving in the right direction,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies. \"This is the most encouraging report we've had in quite some time.\" The report was good news for workers, who saw a 0.5% monthly increase in real wages. Inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings were still down 3% from a year ago. Shelter costs, which make up about one-third of the CPI weighting, continued to rise and are up 5.7% over the past 12 months.\n\nPeople shop at a grocery store on June 10, 2022 in New York City.

The home improvement retailer saw both revenue and comparable store sales come in below analyst forecasts but predicted full-year earnings would come in at the top end of its guidance range.\n\nTarget (TGT) \u2013 Target fell 3.3% in premarket trading after the retailer reported quarterly earnings of 39 cents per share, well short of the 72-cent consensus estimate. Target's revenue matched estimates, but it cut prices significantly during the quarter to reduce excess inventory. Target said the 1.2% operating margin rate during the second quarter would improve to about 6% in the back half of the year.\n\nTJX (TJX) \u2013 The parent of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls retail chains beat estimates by 3 cents with a quarterly profit of 69 cents per share, but revenue and comparable store sales came in less than expected. TJX cut its full-year forecast as well, saying inflation impacted the spending habits of its customers, and the stock fell 1.2% in the premarket.\n\nKrispy Kreme (DNUT) \u2013 Krispy Kreme tumbled 14.7% in premarket action after the doughnut chain reported lower-than-expected profit and revenue for the second quarter. Krispy Kreme said it is seeing significant deceleration in commodity costs in recent weeks.\n\nManchester United (MANU) \u2013 Manchester United rose 4.6% in the premarket after Elon Musk tweeted that he was buying the British football team and then subsequently said he was joking.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) \u2013 Bed Bath & Beyond surged 22.8% in the pre-market after registering over 20% gains in each of the past three sessions. The retailer's shares \u2013 which have been popular with \"meme stock\" investors, are up in 14 of the past 15 sessions, more than quadrupling in value over that stretch.\n\nAgilent Technologies (A) \u2013 Agilent rallied 6.6% in premarket trading after the life sciences and diagnostics company reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue. Agilent also raised its full-year forecast on strong order flow.\n\nSouthwest Gas (SWX) \u2013 Southwest Gas rose 4.7% in premarket action after investor Carl Icahn raised his stake in the utility company to 8.7% from 7.6%.\n\nSanofi (SNY) \u2013 Sanofi shares slid 5.4% in premarket trading after the French drug maker halted development of breast cancer treatment amcenestrant. The halt came after a trial showed no signs that the drug was effective.",

                "text": "UK inflation has risen above 10% for the first time in 40 years, driven by soaring prices for food and fuel as households come under mounting pressure from the cost of living crisis.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said the consumer prices index rose by 10.1% in the year to July, up from a reading of 9.4% in June and entering double figures at an earlier stage than anticipated. The figure was last higher in February 1982.\n\nIt is only the fourth time in 70 years that inflation has breached the 10% threshold, the other periods being 1951-52, 1973-77 and 1979-82.\n\nThe reading exceeded the 9.8% forecast from City economists, as the cost of food and drink rose at the highest rates since 2008 amid a broad-based inflationary burst across the economy.\n\nThe biggest increases came for bread and cereals, dairy, meat and vegetables, with the rising cost of food leading to record increases for restaurant and hotel prices and pushing up the cost of takeaways. Price rises for other staple items such as pet food, toilet rolls, toothbrushes and deodorants also sent inflation soaring.\n\nPrices for package holidays and air fares rose sharply, driven by a summer rush reflected in packed airports across the country.\n\nThe latest figures will pile renewed pressure on the government and Conservative leadership candidates amid accusations the frontrunner, Liz Truss, and Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, are failing to grasp the scale of the cost of living emergency.\n\nRachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said soaring prices were leaving families worried about how to make ends meet in the run-up to a difficult winter. \u201cPeople are worried sick, and while the Tories are busy fighting and ignoring the scale of this crisis. Only Labour can give Britain the fresh start it needs,\u201d she said.\n\nHouseholds are expected to come under further pressure this autumn from a fresh rise in energy bills, which the Bank of England forecasts will drive inflation above 13% and trigger a long recession as families rein in their spending.\n\nSoaring energy prices in Europe, exacerbated by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, have fuelled high inflation across the continent. Although petrol and diesel prices in Britain eased in July from record levels seen a month earlier, the ONS said costs remained significantly higher than a year earlier, adding to inflation.\n\nEconomists warned that soaring food prices and rising energy bills would hit poorer families hardest. \u201cIt will take many months, and much more living standards pain, before inflation starts to ease,\u201d said James Smith, a research director at the Resolution Foundation thinktank. \u201cSo, the number one priority for the next prime minister will be to offer significant support to help millions of families through a brutal winter and beyond.\u201d\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Truss has suggested there would be no more \u201chandouts\u201d to help families, prioritising tax cuts instead.\n\nCharities have called for a doubling of support for the poorest families to avert rising poverty this winter. \u201cNo one can disagree this is a national emergency,\u201d said Rebecca McDonal\u00ad\u00add, the chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s sobering reading means the next few months will be profoundly more difficult. People are looking for a sign that help is on the way. Yet the government doesn\u2019t seem to have grasped the full scale and urgency of this situation.\u201d\n\nAnnual energy bills in Great Britain are forecast to rise to more than \u00a33,500 from October, with a further jump to more than \u00a34,200 in January expected, up from a current level of just under \u00a32,000. Labour has said it would freeze the price cap.\n\nBills had been limited to \u00a31,400 as recently as October last year. Ofgem, the industry regulator for Great Britain, is expected to announce plans for this autumn\u2019s price cap next week.\n\nThe chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, said getting inflation under control was his top priority, while the government would act to support hard-pressed families. \u201cI understand that times are tough, and people are worried about increases in prices that countries around the world are facing,\u201d he added.",

                "text": "Mr. Biden also sees human investment as crucial. The American economy remains dominated by service industries like restaurants and medicine. Its recovery from the pandemic recession has been stunted, in part, by breakdowns in support for some of the workers who should be powering those industries\u2019 revival. The cost and availability of child care alone is keeping many potential workers sidelined, leading to an abundance of unfilled job openings and costing business owners money.\n\nYet Mr. Biden has so far been unable to deliver on many of the programs he proposed to help Americans balance work responsibilities with care for children or aging parents, and to pursue high-quality education from a young age. He could not secure universal prekindergarten or free community college tuition. He could not find support to fund child care subsidies or to extend a tax credit meant to fight child poverty. And his plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to expand and improve home health services for seniors and disabled people have also foundered.\n\nThose omissions add up to what liberal economists call a missed opportunity to help Americans work more and earn more, and to make the economy run more efficiently.\n\nMr. Biden has had more success in getting Democrats, and some Republicans, to invest in the physical economy and to embrace a more interventionist view of federal power, said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the liberal Groundwork Collaborative in Washington. By embracing industrial policy and government-induced emissions reduction, she said, \u201cHe\u2019s moved to an economic system and an economic agenda where the government is really throwing its weight around, putting its thumb on the scale,\u201d she said.\n\nBut, she added, \u201cwe didn\u2019t get the care agenda. That\u2019s a huge miss. Until we get affordable child care, our economy\u2019s not going to be at full strength.\u201d",

                "text": "Farmers harvest a wheat field near Melitopol in Ukraine. Wheat, soybean, sugar, and corn futures have fallen from their March highs back to prices seen at the start of 2022. Olga Maltseva | Afp | Getty Images\n\nFood prices dropped significantly in July from the previous month, particularly the costs of wheat and vegetable oil, according to the latest figures from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. But the FAO said that while the drop in food prices \"from very high levels\" is \"welcome,\" there are doubts over whether the good news will last. \"Many uncertainties remain, including high fertilizer prices that can impact future production prospects and farmers' livelihoods, a bleak global economic outlook, and currency movements, all of which pose serious strains for global food security,\" FAO chief economist Maximo Torero said in a press release. The FAO food price index, which tracks the monthly change in the global prices of a basket of food commodities, fell 8.6% in July from the month before. In June, the index fell just 2.3% month on month. However, the index in July was still 13.1% higher than July 2021.\n\nPrices in the short term may fall further, if futures are anything to go by. Wheat, soybean, sugar, and corn futures have fallen from their March highs back to prices seen at the start of 2022. For example, the wheat contracts closed at $775.75 per bushel on Friday, down from a 12-year high of $1,294 in March, and around the $758 price set in January.\n\nWhy prices fell\n\nAnalysts cited a mix of both demand and supply reasons for the slide in food prices: Ukraine and Russia's closely watched agreement to resume exports of grain through the Black Sea after months of blockade; better-than-expected crop harvests; a global economic slowdown; and the strong U.S. dollar. Rob Vos, the director of markets, trade and institutions at the International Food Policy Research Institute, pointed to the news that the United States and Australia are set to deliver bumper wheat harvests this year, which will improve supply since shipment from Ukraine and Russia have been curtailed. The higher U.S. dollar also lowers the price of staples, since commodities are priced in U.S. dollars, Vos said. Traders tend to ask for lower nominal dollar prices of commodities when the greenback is expensive. The widely heralded U.N.-backed deal between Ukraine and Russia also helped to cool the market. Ukraine was the world's sixth-biggest wheat exporter in 2021, accounting for 10% of global wheat market share, according to the United Nations. The first shipment of Ukrainian grain \u2014 26,000 tons of maize \u2014 since the invasion left the country's southwestern port of Odesa last Monday.\n\nSkepticism over Ukraine-Russia deal\n\nGlobal skepticism over whether Russia will keep its end of the bargain hangs in the air. Russia fired a missile onto Odesa just hours after the U.N.-brokered deal in late-July. And freight and insurance companies may still think it's too risky to ship grain out of a war zone, Vos said, adding that food prices remain volatile and any new shock can cause more price surges. \"To make a difference it will not be enough to get a few shipments out, but at least 30 or 40 per month to get the existing grains stored in Ukraine out, as well as the produce of the upcoming harvest,\" said Vos. \"To help stabilize markets, the deal will need to hold in full also during the second half of the year since that is the period where Ukraine does most of its exports.\"\n\nEven with the existing agreement, arable Ukrainian land may continue to be destroyed \"for as long as the war continues,\" which will result in even less crop yield next year, Carlos Mera, the head of agri commodities market research at Rabobank, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Europe\" last week. \"Once this [grain] corridor is over, we might see even more price increases going forward,\" Mera said. Consumers could also see further price increases as there is normally a lag of three to nine months before a movement in commodity prices is reflected on supermarket shelves. Then there is the pressure of exporting enough grain as quickly as possible from a war zone. \"It's time that we're working again. I don't see us exporting two [to] five million tons per month out of these Black Sea ports,\" John Rich, the executive chairman of Ukrainian poultry giant Myronivsky Hliboproduct (MHP), told CNBC's \"Capital Connection\" on Monday. \"Hungry people, at the end of the day, get hungry very quickly after a week.\" In a note published earlier this month, credit rating agency Fitch Ratings' analysts wrote that a possible increase in fertilizer prices, which fell recently \u2014 but which are still double that of 2020 \u2014 could cause grain prices to jump again. Russia's restriction of gas supply has led European natural gas prices to spike. Natural gas is a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers. La Nina weather patterns could disrupt grain harvests later this year as well, they added.\n\nAnd the fall in food prices is not all good news. Part of the reason why staples have become cheaper is that traders and investors are pricing in recessionary fears, the analysts said. The global manufacturing purchasing managers' index has been in decline, while the U.S. Federal Reserve seems bent on raising interest rates to curb inflation even if it triggers a recession, the Fitch team wrote.\n\nFood staples",

It was the sixth successive interest rate hike.\n\nIn theory this is good news for the UK\u2019s army of savers, who were the losers from years of interest rate cuts. Many will have been expecting to see the rates on their savings accounts climb \u2013 but the reality has all too often been very different.\n\nSo what\u2019s the bad news?\n\nResearch issued on Tuesday found that as of 15 August, Britain\u2019s banks and building societies had passed on the full 0.5 percentage point increase to just two out of 233 easy access savings accounts.\n\nAs of that date, the only provider to pass on all of the increase was the West Brom building society, according to the study by the website Investing Reviews.\n\nProviders that had given their accounts some sort of boost \u2013 that is, they had passed on part of the increase \u2013 included Zopa, Tesco Bank, Atom Bank, Tandem Bank, Skipton building society and Gatehouse Bank, it said.\n\nIn all, only 26 easy access accounts (11.2%) had seen any increase at all in the rate paid following the 4 August rise, the study said.\n\nDo banks have to pass on interest rate rises?\n\nAccount providers are at liberty to do what they want with savings rates unfortunately. They might decide to pass on all, some or none of an interest rate rise (or reduction).\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So \u2013 taking a glass-half-full view \u2013 just because your account has not as of today had its rate increased does not mean you will not get an increase.\n\nOne expert said: \u201cTo be fair, it is a little early to see savings changes \u2026 Some brands may only now be catching up to prior base rate rises.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Rachel Springall at the financial data firm Moneyfacts said: \u201cAs we have seen time and time again, there is no guarantee savings providers will boost their rates because of a Bank of England rate rise and, even if they do, it could take a few months to trickle through to customers.\u201d\n\nOn 23 January this year, more than five weeks after the Bank of England lifted the base rate from 0.1% to 0.25%, the Guardian reported that only four financial firms had passed on the full rise to all, or nearly all, of their variable-rate savings account customers.\n\nSo some people have benefited from savings rate increases?\n\nOverall, according to figures issued on Monday by Moneyfacts, the average easy access rate has risen to 0.7% and stands at its highest point in nine years. In August last year the average was 0.18%.\n\nSo why aren\u2019t providers increasing savings rates?\n\nSome experts have previously argued that most of the big banks are uninterested in attracting savers\u2019 deposits.\n\nSome will say the banks are relying on customer apathy. Some customers will quit in search of a better deal, if they can find one, but many others will not notice the change or will not get around to moving their money.\n\nBut rising interest rates are obviously good news for savers?\n\nYes of course, but unfortunately, even if the latest increase is passed on in full, rising inflation \u2013 currently 9.4% and set to go higher \u2013 is eroding the value of people\u2019s nest-egg cash.",

Got straight on the phone and activate,\u201d Mr. Baines rapped in the song, flashing cash and envelopes with preloaded debit cards from the state.\n\n\u201cUnemployment so sweet,\u201d he said.\n\nAll three of those programs are now over. There is no official estimate for the amount of money that was stolen from them \u2014 or from pandemic-relief programs in general. The Justice Department has charged people with about $1 billion in fraud so far, and is investigating other cases involving $6 billion more, investigators said.\n\nBut other reports have suggested the real number could be much higher. One official said the total of \u201cimproper\u201d unemployment payments could be more than $163 billion, as first reported by The Washington Post. In the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, a watchdog found that $58 billion had been paid to companies that shared the same addresses, phone numbers, bank accounts or other data as other applicants \u2014 a sign of potential fraud.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear there\u2019s tens of billions in fraud,\u201d said Michael Horowitz, the chairman of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, which includes 21 agency inspectors general working on fraud cases. \u201cWould it surprise me if it exceeded $100 billion? No.\u201d\n\nThe effort to catch fraudsters began as soon as the money started flowing, and the first person was charged with benefit fraud in May 2020. But investigators were quickly deluged with tips at a scale they had never dealt with before. The Small Business Administration\u2019s fraud hotline \u2014 which had previously received 800 calls a year \u2014 got 148,000 in the first year of the pandemic. The Small Business Administration sent its inspector general two million loan applications to check for potential identity theft. At the Labor Department, the inspector general\u2019s office has 39,000 cases of suspected unemployment fraud, a 1,000 percent increase from prepandemic levels.\n\nBut prosecutors face a key disadvantage: While fraud takes minutes, investigations take months and prosecutions take even longer.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nThe consumer outlook for inflation decreased significantly in July amid a sharp drop in gas prices and a growing belief that the rapid surges in food and housing also would ebb in the future. The New York Federal Reserve's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations showed that respondents expect inflation to run at a 6.2% pace over the next year and a 3.2% rate for the next three years. While those numbers are still very high by historical standards, they mark a big drop-off from the respective 6.8% and 3.6% results from the June survey. Through June, food prices rose 10.4% over the past year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They are still expected to climb 6.7% over the next 12 months, but that's a decline from the June survey of 2.5 percentage points, the biggest fall in a data series going back to June 2013.\n\nLikewise, respondents see gas prices, which rose 60% over the past year, increasing at just a 1.5% pace over the next year, a slide of 4.2 percentage points from June, the second-biggest monthly decline in the survey's history. The price of regular gas has come down about 67 cents a gallon over the past month though it remains 87 cents higher than a year ago, according to AAA. Commodity prices overall have been falling significantly as well. Finally, home prices are expected to rise 3.5% from June's 4.4%, the lowest projected gain since November 2020. Five-year inflation expectations also slipped, dropping 0.5 percentage point to 2.3%.",

                "text": "Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading.\n\nWalmart, Home Depot \u2014 The retailers' shares rose about 5% each after both companies reported better-than-expected earnings for the most recent quarter. That lifted other retail stocks, which led market gains. Bath & Body Works jumped 6%. Target and Best Buy each added about 5%. Ross Stores, Lowe's and TJX Companies climbed about 3% each.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond \u2014 The home retailer's shares skyrocketed about 64%. At its highest, shares added more than 70% to touch an intraday high of $28.60 Tuesday amid multiple trading halts due to volatility. The rally came as retail traders active on social media piled into the stock, encouraged by news that GameStop chair Ryan Cohen placed another bet on the struggling retailer.\n\nNu Holdings \u2014 Shares of the Warren Buffett-backed digital banking company surged more than 23% after the firm reported quarterly revenue that rose 230% from a year earlier. Berkshire Hathaway owned $400 million of Nu Holdings shares at the end of the second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter.\n\nZipRecruiter \u2014 Shares of ZipRecruiter slipped 5% even though it posted second-quarter results that were better than expected. The company said it sees employers pulling back on job postings. It also expects the labor market's strength may weaken through the end of the year and lowered its full-year revenue outlook to reflect the economic backdrop.\n\nZoom Video \u2014 Shares of the video teleconferencing service fell about 5% after Citi downgraded the company, saying growing competition from Microsoft Teams could push the stock down 20%. The bank said Zoom has too many post-pandemic challenges in addition to rising competition, including macro-related weakness hitting businesses and margin risk.\n\nSnowflake \u2014 The cloud computing company's shares fell 5% after UBS downgraded them to neutral from buy amid mounting macro and competitive pressures. UBS also cited a slowdown in customer spending of cloud computing as well as rising competition.\n\nThredUp \u2014 The apparel reselling platform operator rallied more than 17% after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue, as well as a 29% increase in active buyers.\n\nAlly Financial \u2014 Shares of the home and auto lender jumped over 3% after a regulatory filing showed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway more than tripled its position in the company's last quarter. Berkshire held roughly 30 million shares of Ally, worth about $1 billion, at the end of June. The conglomerate initiated the bet in the first quarter.\n\nMasimo \u2014 Shares of the medical technology developer jumped more than 6% after activist investor Politan Capital Management took a 9% stake in the company. Politan said it's dedicated to improving Masimo's stock price.\n\nBHP Group \u2014 Shares of the Australian mining company rose more than 5% after BHP reported that its total profit for the 2022 fiscal year was $30.9 billion, compared to $11.3 billion in the prior year.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Yun Li, Carmen Reinicke and Jesse Pound contributed reporting.",

More than one in eight UK households fear they have no further way to make cuts to afford a sharp increase in annual energy bills expected this autumn.\n\nDiscounters Aldi and Lidl both increased sales by double-digit percentages in the three months to 7 August as shoppers sought ways to reduce their bills. Kantar found that together Lidl and Aldi have gained 1.8 percentage points of British grocery sales over this period, representing a \u00a32.3bn annual shift in spending. The homegrown discounter Iceland also increased sales by almost 3%.\n\nAldi is close to overtaking Morrisons to become the UK\u2019s fourth largest supermarket. Its market share rose 0.9 percentage points to 9.1%, a fraction behind Morrisons on 9.3%.\n\nWaitrose, Morrisons and independent stores all saw sales fall back, as the overall grocery market rose 2.2% in the three months.\n\nThe summer weather pushed up sales of mineral water, ice-cream and summer clothing, which rose 23%, 18% and 163% respectively.",

Gannet77 | Getty Images\n\nBritain's Post Office, which offers banking services as well as mail, handled a record \u00a3801 million ($967 million) in personal cash withdrawals in July. In total, more than \u00a33.3 billion in cash was withdrawn and deposited over the Post Office's counters \u2014 the first time the amount has crossed the \u00a33.3 billion threshold in its 360-year history. Personal cash withdrawals were up almost 8% month on month at \u00a3744 in June, and up over 20% from a year ago to \u00a3665 million in July.\n\nStaycations and budgeting\n\nThe spike in cash use is down to several factors. \"Firstly, more people use cash when they go on staycation, secondly, the Post Office helped to hand out support to energy customers in the form of cash, and thirdly, people are using it as a budgeting method,\" said Laura Suter, head of finance at AJ Bell. The Post Office research found that 71% of Brits planning to go on holiday in the U.K. this year intend to take out cash before doing so. Of those who have holidayed in the U.K. in the last five years, almost a third admitted to being caught out by not having cash on them. In July, the Post Office processed more than 600,000 cash payouts for people eligible for energy bill support from the British government. That came to around \u00a390 million and allowed people to pay energy bills, top up gas and electricity meters or use cash for easier budgeting. In total, \u00a33.31 billion in cash deposits and withdrawals were processed at the Post Office in July, \u00a3100 million higher than in June. The data comes as the country continues to grapple with rising inflation. The Bank of England expects headline inflation to peak at 13.3% in October and to remain at elevated levels throughout much of 2023.\n\nIs it here to stay?",

                "text": "Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a \"Morning Meeting\" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Tuesday's key moments: We want growth without inflation WMT, HD earnings beats boost retailers Quick mentions: CTRA, DIS, WFC 1. We want growth without inflation Stocks were mixed Tuesday, with tech names keeping a lid on the Nasdaq as bond yields moved higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up for its fifth straight session. West Texas Intermediate crude, the American oil benchmark, fell 2.5%, which bodes well for inflation. Jim Cramer has repeatedly said that he believes oil's peak in June helped cool down inflation in July. While the market and economy have shown promising signs recently, Jim emphasized Tuesday: \"We want growth without inflation. We don't want oil to be too hot.\" 2. WMT, HD earnings beats boost retailers Home Depot (HD) and Walmart (WMT) reported earnings beats before the bell on Tuesday, pushing other retailers' stocks up, including Club holding Costco (COST). While we held positions in both Walmart and Costco earlier this year, we sold off the former after its warnings of excess inventory and the potential impact to its bottom line. Costco, on the other hand, has not faced the same kind of inventory issues. It's also successfully raised prices for some items and held prices steady for others, all while maintaining strong sales. This week is chock-full of other retailers reporting earnings. See a list here . We'll be watching each one as they reveal their financial results, and in turn, provide insights on consumers spending and inflation. 3. Quick mentions: CTRA, DIS, WFC We also have updates on some other Club names. Natural gas soared roughly 5% on Tuesday, spiking to its highest level since late July. This is good news for Club holding Coterra Energy (CTRA), which Jim calls \"the best natural gas company in the country.\" We have reviewed Dan Loeb's recommendations on Disney (DIS), and we believe there's nothing revelatory there. Cost cutting, for example, is something we're sure the company already has on its radar. As for Loeb's urging that Disney spin off ESPN, we believe that while that could be good for the company's bottom-line in the short-term, having a live sports component to its streaming is crucial, especially since it helps differentiate its product from other services like Netflix (NFLX). Banks have been performing well recently, and we believe that the best ones to own right now are Bank of America (BAC) and Club holding Wells Fargo (WFC) for their large deposit bases. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long CTRA, COST, DIS and WFC. See here for a full list of the stocks.) As a subscriber to the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer, you will receive a trade alert before Jim makes a trade. Jim waits 45 minutes after sending a trade alert before buying or selling a stock in his charitable trust's portfolio. If Jim has talked about a stock on CNBC TV, he waits 72 hours after issuing the trade alert before executing the trade.

                "text": "There are two ways of looking at the state of Britain\u2019s labour market. In one it is a case of the glass being half full, in the other half empty.\n\nIf you are a government minister you take the former view. Nadhim Zahawi said the unemployment rate of 3.8% has rarely been lower in decades and the chancellor is right about that.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the economy continued to create net new jobs in the three months to June, with employment rising by 160,000 over the quarter. Flash estimates suggest the pattern continued into July.\n\nWith job vacancies at near-record levels, the labour market looks in good shape to withstand the recession the Bank of England is forecasting for the UK. The economy contracted slightly in the three months to June, but demand for workers remained strong.\n\nThat\u2019s the upbeat way of looking at the latest jobs figures from the Office for National Statistics. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, says \u201cby any metric the labour market is still very tight\u201d.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The increase in the size of the workforce is being driven by immigration, he notes, with the number of non-UK nationals either working or looking for a job rising by almost 250,000 in the past year.\n\nThe domestic labour force is also likely to increase as people try to maintain their living standards at a time when cost of living pressures are intensifying, and this will lead to higher unemployment as a weakening economy leads to fewer job opportunities.\n\nUltimately, the labour market data shows where the economy has been but doesn\u2019t necessarily show where it is heading. Employment growth was healthy as the UK came out of lockdown. Annual regular pay growth has picked up to 4.7% as firms have struggled to find workers.\n\nThe question is whether those days are now in the past, as the Bank of England certainly thinks. Threadneedle Street sees a protracted recession pushing the unemployment rate to above 6% by 2025. Judging by the most up-to-date evidence, that process has started.",

But Ms. Bettis thinks she can save enough money to open her own storefront.\n\n\u201cWe just went through a period where millions died, so are you going to spend your time at your job if it doesn\u2019t fulfill you?\u201d Ms. Bettis said, summing up gig work\u2019s appeal. \u201cEverybody loves stability, but if the flexibility isn\u2019t there, I don\u2019t think a lot of people are going to go back.\u201d\n\nLabor advocates have long been concerned about businesses that depend on independent contractors, since those workers aren\u2019t entitled to the rights and benefits that come with employee status, like employer contributions to payroll taxes and unemployment insurance. But while the model has gained traction, it has been difficult to pin down how fast the ranks of gig workers are growing.\n\nThe most accurate measure is Internal Revenue Service data on 1099 tax forms \u2014 the freelancers\u2019 counterpart to the W-2 forms filed for employees \u2014 but that is available only to select researchers and released with a lag of several years. At last count, in 2018, a team of economists found that about 1.2 percent of workers with any earnings had at least some income from online platform work. (A Pew survey from 2021 found that the share of all adults with gig income in a 12-month period was about 9 percent.)\n\nThe closest government metric that is more timely comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which asks people whether they count themselves as self-employed. That number rose significantly as a share of the labor force from early 2020 to early this year. But it generally captures people for whom self-employment is the main source of income \u2014 which, for most gig workers, it isn\u2019t. More likely, the bump represents an increase in the number of people working as home improvement contractors and owner-operator truck drivers \u2014 two longtime means of self-employment that surged during the pandemic \u2014 and some white-collar freelancers.",

Joe Raedle | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nBed Bath & Beyond shares soared Tuesday as retail traders active on social media piled into the stock, encouraged by news that GameStop Chairman Ryan Cohen placed another bet on the struggling retailer. Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond skyrocketed more than 70% to an intraday high of $28.04 in midday trading Tuesday amid multiple halts due to volatility. The stock ended the session 29% higher.\n\nLoading chart...\n\nA regulatory filing Monday evening showed that Cohen's venture capital firm RC Ventures bought distant out-of-the-money call options on more than 1.6 million Bed Bath & Beyond shares with strike prices between $60 and $80. Investors profit from calls when the underlying securities rise in prices. The strike price is where the security can be bought by the option holder, meaning Cohen is betting that Bed Bath & Beyond can rise as high as $80 a share. The stock closed Monday at $16. The call options that Cohen bought expire in January 2023.\n\nThe new purchase grabbed the attention of retail traders on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum. The ticker BBBY became the most popular mention in the chat room Tuesday, according to alternative data provider Quiver Quantitative. Trading volumes in Bed Bath & Beyond exploded Tuesday with more than 160 million shares changing hands as of noon ET. The company only has about 80 million shares outstanding, according to a regulatory filing. Cohen first revealed he held a nearly 10% stake in Bed Bath & Beyond through RC Ventures in early March. FactSet says his holdings amounted to 11.82% as of late March. At the time, the GameStop chairman wrote a letter to Bed Bath's then CEO, Mark Tritton, saying he believed the home goods chain was struggling to reverse market share declines and navigate supply chain woes. He also urged the retailer to consider selling its Buybuy Baby chain.",

                "text": "The real value of UK workers\u2019 pay continued to fall at the fastest rate for 20 years in June as wage increases were outstripped by soaring inflation amid the cost of living crisis.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said annual growth in average pay, excluding bonuses, strengthened to 4.7% in the three months to June against a backdrop of low unemployment and high job vacancies.\n\nHowever, the real value of workers\u2019 pay packets dropped by 3% \u2013 the fastest decline since comparable records began in 2001 \u2013 after taking account of its preferred measure of inflation.\n\nGrowth in average earnings including bonuses was 5.1%, although also failed to keep pace with the soaring cost of living.\n\nThe latest snapshot showed early signs of a slowdown in hiring demand among employers despite job vacancies remaining close to a record high. The ONS said unemployment rose slightly to 3.8% in the three months to June, while the number of new job openings fell for the first time since summer 2020.\n\nGrowth in employment slowed to 160,000 in the three months to June, well below analysts\u2019 forecasts, suggesting the jobs market is beginning to cool as Britain\u2019s economic performance falters.\n\nRuth Gregory, a senior UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cJune\u2019s labour market figures revealed further evidence that the weaker economy is leading to a slightly less tight labour market.\u201d\n\nThe chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, said the latest figures showed Britain\u2019s jobs market was in a strong position, with unemployment lower than at almost any point in the past 40 years. \u201c[That is] good news in what I know are difficult times for people,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are delivering a \u00a337bn package of help for households through cash grants and tax cuts so people can keep more of what they earn.\u201d\n\nHowever, the figures underlining the unprecedented hit for workers\u2019 pay are likely to add to the pressure on the government and Conservative leadership candidates amid the cost of living crisis.\n\nLabour said the figures showed the Tories had lost control of the economy. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cThis zombie government is offering no solutions to the cost of living crisis.\u201d\n\nInflation as measured by the consumer price index reached 9.4% in July, the highest rate for 40 years. With a fresh increase in energy bills expected this autumn, the Bank of England forecasts inflation to peak above 13%, alongside a long recession as households rein in their spending.\n\nFrances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the figures showed urgent government action was required to support households ahead of a difficult winter. \u201cThey should cancel the increase to the energy price cap. And they must do far more to get pay rising \u2013 starting with boosting the minimum wage this autumn and giving public sector workers a decent pay rise.\u201d\n\nThe pay data revealed a widening gulf between public and private sector workers, with pay in the private sector rising by 5.9% over the past year, more than three times the 1.8% growth rate in the public sector.\n\nAccording to analysis by the accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, the pay of the richest 1% of workers rose by almost four times the rate of the poorest 10th, highlighting how some households are more insulated from the cost of living crisis than others.\n\nThe Resolution Foundation said the scale of the pay squeeze was deeper than official figures suggest, with the real value of average weekly wages falling by the most since the Queen\u2019s silver jubilee in 1977.\n\nNye Cominetti, a senior economist at the thinktank, said: \u201cThis squeeze has come about despite robust pay growth and a lively jobs market, with pay settlements strengthening slightly, and almost a million people moving jobs in the last three months.\u201d\n\n",

                "text": "In this article CMCSA\n\nMark Hoffman, Chairman of CNBC\n\nMark Hoffman, CNBC's president since 2005 and chairman since 2015, announced Tuesday he will step down on Sept. 12. Hoffman is leaving of his own accord. NBCUniversal hired Cesar Conde to oversee NBC News, MSNBC and CNBC in May 2020 to bring more centralized leadership to the group. KC Sullivan will return to replace Hoffman as CNBC's new president. Sullivan has spent the last two years as president and managing director of NBCUniversal's global advertising and partnerships, based in London. Before that, he was president and managing director of CNBC International and CNBC's chief financial officer.\n\nSullivan will return to the U.S. for his new role. Hoffman will stay on as a consultant through the transition, Conde wrote in a note to NBCUniversal employees. \"Mark has overseen the steady continued growth of CNBC as the world's #1 business and money news brand,\" Conde said. \"No business news organization comes close to the reach and influence of CNBC, a true testament to Mark's leadership.\" CNBC is one of NBCUniversal's most consistently profitable assets, even as millions of Americans drop linear cable TV subscriptions each year. Hoffman, 65, has increased profitability at CNBC in 16 of his 17 years running the company. CNBC is set to grow its profitability again in 2022, according to a person familiar with the matter. \"We are in the business of business so it's important to note we've never been more profitable, setting record after record in financial performance, year after year, as we maneuvered through economic cycles, exogenous events and the historic secular change that accompanied the information age,\" Hoffman said in a note to CNBC employees.\n\nHoffman's CNBC tenure\n\nHoffman first joined CNBC in 1997 before leaving in 2001 for a series of leadership positions at local TV stations. He returned to CNBC in 2005 and immediately pushed to acquire 50% equity interests in CNBC Europe and CNBC Asia from Dow Jones, as well as a 25% stake in CNBC World. With financial control over its international properties, Hoffman expanded CNBC's TV reach and turned his attention to growing CNBC's digital business. CNBC.com has grown sixfold in the past six years, with unique monthly readership growing from about 30 million to nearly 200 million.",

            "newsTextAndEnts": {
                "text": "There was an amusing interlude during BP\u2019s announcement of bumper profits earlier this month when the chief executive, Bernard Looney, was asked what he planned to do with the \u00a3400 rebate on his energy bill that would arrive courtesy of the cost of living support package that Rishi Sunak, then chancellor, announced in May. Looney appeared unaware that he, like everybody else in the UK, would get the discount automatically from October. It was only later that BP offered the PR-friendly answer that its \u00a34.4m-a-year boss would make a donation to charity.\n\nLooney\u2019s bafflement was understandable. High earners like him (and, indeed, high earners collecting considerably less) obviously don\u2019t need assistance from the state in paying their energy bills this winter. There was no sound economic reason for Sunak to add a universally applied \u00a3400 element to a package that was otherwise rightly concentrated on vulnerable households, meaning those most affected by higher bills.\n\nThat point, bizarrely, seems to have been lost on Sir Keir Starmer. The Labour leader has opted to back the most untargeted form of support this winter \u2013 a plan to freeze the price of energy for all consumers, rich and poor alike, at its current level for six months.\n\nThe idea is popular, we\u2019re told, because three out of four Tory voters support it. In that sense, it may represent smart politics; the next prime minister will be under pressure to adopt chunks of the proposal, including the increase in the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers. But the economics of freezing energy prices for all households, as opposed to only those least able to afford higher prices, makes little sense.\n\nStarmer\u2019s scheme has the virtue of simplicity, it could be argued \u2013 and, yes, the plan is costed if one accepts the \u00a37bn fiddle with the effect of temporarily reduced inflation-related payments on government debt. But a programme that costs \u00a330bn for six months becomes vastly expensive if it has to be repeated for as long as wholesale prices remain high \u2013 a timeframe that is currently unknowable. If the Looney household and others didn\u2019t need Sunak\u2019s \u00a3400 discount, they definitely don\u2019t require the average \u00a31,000 saving that Labour\u2019s proposal would deliver.\n\nMore to the point, artificially holding down prices for everybody undermines the incentive on wealthier households to reduce their energy consumption, an imperative that ought to be front and centre of any national plan to get through the emergency. Starmer is also talking the language of more insulation in homes, but artificially underpricing a scarce resource does nothing to encourage consumers to turn down their boiler settings in the short term, use their spin dryers less, and so on. \u201cSuppressing the price signal is only going to increase the likelihood that we run out of energy this winter,\u201d says one independent energy analyst, Peter Atherton. Exactly right.\n\nOne can argue all day about how to define a high-earning household that doesn\u2019t need support from the public purse, but a means-tested approach of some form still seems the best way to proceed. It would be fairer, more financially sustainable in the long term and more likely to change behaviour. Labour\u2019s plan has got off on the wrong foot; support should be targeted.\n\nHeathrow seems to have redefined success\n\nThe way the Heathrow chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, tells it, imposing a cap on the number of flights at the airport has been a complete triumph. Limiting the number of departing passengers to 100,000 a day since July has delivered fewer last-minute flight cancellations, better take-off punctuality and shorter waits for bags, the airport was boasting only last week.\n\nSo, having bought time to regroup and focus, is Heathrow now in a position to resume a normal schedule in time for the next surge in demand that will arrive with the October half-term holiday? Actually, no. The airport is extending the cap until 29 October for the same reason: that it needs to support \u201cmore reliable and resilient passenger journeys\u201d.\n\nAn extension is probably sensible if Heathrow \u2013 or the ground-handling firms it usually blames during episodes of chaos \u2013 still haven\u2019t got the necessary resources in place. But let\u2019s not miss the wider picture. Being bounced into capping the number of passengers was a spectacular failure of management that flowed from the under-estimation of the speed of the recovery in demand. Taking even longer to fix the problem is not a success.",

                "text": "A person removes the nozel from a pump at a gas station on July 29, 2022 in Arlington, Virginia. Olivier Douliery | AFP | Getty Images\n\nYou'd be hard-pressed now to find a recession in the rearview mirror. What's down the road, though, is another story. There is no historical precedent to indicate that an economy in recession can produce 528,000 jobs in a month, as the U.S. did during July. A 3.5% unemployment rate, tied for the lowest since 1969, is not consistent with contraction. But that doesn't mean there isn't a recession ahead, and, ironically enough, it is the labor market's phenomenal resiliency that could pose the broader economy's biggest long-run danger. The Federal Reserve is trying to ease pressures on a historically tight jobs situation and its rapid wage gains in an effort to control inflation running at its highest level in more than 40 years.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is this gives the Fed additional room to continue to tighten, even if it raises the probability of pushing the economy into recession,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \"It's not going to be an easy task to continue to tighten without negative repercussions for the consumer and the economy.\" Indeed, following the robust job numbers, which included a 5.2% 12-month gain for average hourly earnings, traders accelerated their bets on a more aggressive Fed. As of Friday afternoon, markets were assigning about a 69% chance of the central bank enacting its third straight 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike when it meets again in September, according to CME Group data. So while President Joe Biden celebrated the big jobs number on Friday, a much more unpleasant data point could be on the way next week. The consumer price index, the most widely followed inflation measure, comes out Wednesday, and it's expected to show continued upward pressure even with a sharp drop in gasoline prices in July. That will complicate the central bank's balancing act of using rate increases to temper inflation without tipping the economy into recession. As Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at asset management giant BlackRock, said, the challenge is \"how to execute a 'soft landing' when the economy is coming in hot, and is landing on a runway it has never used before.\" \"Today's print, coming in much stronger than anticipated, complicates the job of a Federal Reserve that seeks to engineer a more temperate employment environment, in keeping with its attempts to moderate current levels of inflation,\" Rieder said in a client note. \"The question though now is how much longer (and higher) will rates have to go before inflation can be brought under control?\"\n\nMore recession signs",

Retail sales rose by 2.7% from a year ago, again significantly below expectations, as China\u2019s economic recovery from pandemic lockdowns earlier this year showed signs of fizzling out.\n\nChina\u2019s economy narrowly escaped a contraction in the second quarter, hobbled by the lockdown of the commercial hub of Shanghai and a deepening downturn in the property market, as well as persistently weaker levels of consumer spending.\n\nThe country\u2019s property sector, rocked by a mortgage boycott as thousands of homebuyers refuse to keep up with payments on unfinished flats bought off plan, also weakened in July.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Energy traders are also eyeing the potential for a nuclear deal between Iran and western negotiators that could pave the way for an increase in the supply of oil.\n\nThe global oil price has dropped from a peak close to $140 in March, when concerns over supplies from Russia reached their height. However, prices are still historically high as the war in Ukraine continues, at almost 50% above levels seen at the end of 2019.\n\nSoaring energy prices have been the biggest driver of high inflation in the UK and other advanced economies amid the worsening cost of living crisis.\n\nBjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at the Swedish bank SEB, said it was clear that weakness in Chinese oil demand was one of the main reasons why oil prices had fallen back since early June.\n\n\u201cThere is little hope that China will change its Covid-19 stance anytime soon and there is a high risk that Chinese demand weakness persists amid continued rolling lockdowns from month to month,\u201d he said.",

Brent crude oil futures prices reached the joint-lowest level since February, while West Texas Intermediate set a new low. Falling energy prices would be a blessing to economies around the world in the short term as they struggle with the political and financial implications of inflation, but $90 for a barrel of oil is still pretty high in historical terms. It is likely to be the poorest households who bear the most pain when bills rise in the winter. In the UK the energy price cap is expected to rise above \u00a34,200 for an average annual bill in January. New analysis by the Resolution Foundation suggests that the poorest fifth of households will have to cut their discretionary spending by more than a fifth to make up for the energy price increase. Even the richest households will have to tighten their belts. Poorer UK households will have to reduce their spending by more than a fifth to pay for energy bills. Photograph: Resolution Foundation That will mean a lot of products and services that are not bought. Little wonder that economists are bracing for recession in the UK and elsewhere \u2013 and little wonder that it is likely to be the key political issue for the contenders to be UK prime minister. The Resolution Foundation\u2019s Mike Brewer, Karl Handscomb, and Jonathan Marshall wrote: This winter, low-income households will have to reduce their spending by three times as much as high-income households in order to afford their energy bills \u2013 a situation that is particularly concerning now that we know energy bills in January-March 2023 are set to be an annualised \u00a34,266, rather than the \u00a32,800 expected earlier this year.

It appears traders across the Atlantic also have their eye on a possible Chinese slowdown. Here are the opening snaps, via Reuters: S&P 500 DOWN 22.85 POINTS, OR 0.53%, AT 4,257.30 AFTER MARKET OPEN\n\nNASDAQ DOWN 50.98 POINTS, OR 0.39%, AT 12,996.20 AFTER MARKET OPEN\n\nDOW JONES DOWN 171.96 POINTS, OR 0.51%, AT 33,589.09 AFTER MARKET OPEN\n\n\n\n3d ago 14.25 Oil prices fall to lowest level since before Russia invaded Ukraine The latest dip has pushed Brent crude oil, the North Sea benchmark, to a low of $92.78: that is the joint lowest level since before Vladimir Putin ordered the start of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Monday\u2019s steep oil price decline exactly matched the previous post-invasion low, which was reached on 5 August. Brent prices peaked on 7 March at $139.13 when concerns over supplies from Russia reached their height. They have remained above $100 for most of the time since then \u2013 a level rarely seen in history. Brent crude oil futures prices reached their lowest point since 21 February on Monday. Photograph: Refinitiv It is a similar story for West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, which hit a low of $86.82, the lowest since 3 February.\n\n\n\n3d ago 13.37 Oil prices down by $5 after weak Chinese data sparks concerns Chinese industrial production was lower than expected by economists in July. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images The latest check-in on oil prices: prices have dropped by as much as $5. That\u2019s a pretty chunky move for a single day (although things can be magnified in mid-August when a lot of traders are lying on beaches, meaning fewer sellers can have an outsized impact). The new low for the day for Brent crude futures prices is $93.03. That is really not far off the nearly six-month low ($92.78) set just before Russia invaded Ukraine. It is 5.1% down, or $5, for the day. A persistent drop in energy prices would be welcome news for households around the world, who are struggling with inflation. However, it remains to be seen whether a durable decline will be delivered. And it should also be noted that the reason for the decline is not exactly a short-term positive: traders are looking at the global economy and thinking about recessions in several of the biggest economies. That was sparked by weak Chinese data earlier this morning: Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, explains: It is becoming quite clear that weakness in Chinese oil demand is one of the main reasons for the steady decline in oil prices since early June. Chinese crude oil imports were below 9m barrels per day in both June and July and oil demand is no higher today than it was in October 2019. There is little hope that China will change its Covid-19 stance anytime soon and there is a high risk that Chinese demand weakness persists amid continued rolling lock-downs from month to month. A normalisation of Chinese oil demand at some point in time will be extremely bullish for oil prices, but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to happen anytime soon.\n\n\n\n3d ago 12.00 Nationwide to pay \u00a31,200 to lower-paid staff as cost of living bonus Nationwide will pay more than 11,000 a bonus to cover increased living costs. Photograph: Maureen McLean/REX/Shutterstock Nationwide Building Society will pay more than 11,000 of its staff \u00a31,200 to help them cope with Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis. The offer will be made to staff making less than \u00a335,000, or about 61% of Nationwide\u2019s workforce of 18,000 people, said Nationwide, a mutual owned by its customers. The building society has already raised pay by 4% earlier this year, but with inflation expected to reach 13% by the Bank of England that would result in a steep real-terms pay cut. A bonus would address some of this pay rise, but with the advantage for the business of not locking in a higher wage bill. The company\u2019s press release makes it very clear the bonus is a \u201cone off\u201d. HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest and the UK arm of Santander have all announced similar bonuses. Debbie Crosbie, Nationwide\u2019s chief executive, said: The months ahead will be worrying for many people and we\u2019re always considering new ways to help our members. But rising prices affect our colleagues too and that\u2019s why we\u2019re providing this additional support.\n\n\n\n3d ago 11.33 Every time you look at oil prices this morning it seems like they have lost more ground. The new low for Brent crude today is $93.54, down $4.60 today or 4.7%. The post-invasion low is $92.78. That\u2019s still 70 cents away, but after today\u2019s drop that suddenly doesn\u2019t look implausible.\n\n\n\n3d ago 11.15 Today\u2019s commodity price sell-off is giving a good case study of the importance of mining and oil companies to the FTSE 100. London\u2019s benchmark index is the only one of Europe\u2019s main markets to have dipped into the red this morning. Europe may have its fair share of old economy stalwarts (compared to the US\u2019s tech-heavy stock benchmarks), but the FTSE 100 is uniquely exposed to commodities among its peers (and that\u2019s even after a giant steel company, Evraz, was suspended because it was owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, who is under UK sanctions). The FTSE 100 was the only major European index in the red on Monday morning. Photograph: Refinitiv\n\n\n\n3d ago 10.52 Oil isn\u2019t the only commodity under pressure. The benchmark LME nickel contract dropped more than 3% this morning, silver is down 2.3%, platinum has fallen 2.6%. That commodity sell-off has dragged back the FTSE 100. It is just about in the red, with miners Antofagasta, Anglo American and Rio Tinto plus supermajor oil companies Shell and BP among the 10 biggest fallers. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at trading platform OANDA, said: The figures from China really are a concern and the authorities have a big job on their hands arresting flagging domestic demand. That doesn\u2019t bode well for oil demand especially when the country remains so committed to zero-Covid. And with cases continuing to rise, the downward pressure on oil prices could intensify. Throw in a deal between the US and Iran and we may be able to wave goodbye to triple-digit oil prices for a while. Of course, it doesn\u2019t matter how close the two are, a deal can never be assumed to be done until it\u2019s signed. If it does get over the line, we could see oil slip below $90 and perhaps even stay there.\n\n\n\n3d ago 10.35 And just like that Brent crude oil prices have dropped by more than a dollar: as I write it\u2019s at $94.67. That\u2019s a $3.40 drop for today, or 3.6%. Oil prices dropped steeply on Monday morning. Photograph: Refinitiv The most obvious cause appears to be jitters caused by China\u2019s weak economic data. A major slowdown would likely drag back demand for oil.\n\n\n\n3d ago 10.22 And here is a reminder of what an energy crisis can do: Kosovo is starting intermittent power cuts because it is too expensive to import energy. \u201cConsumers will have six hours on and two hours off,\u201d a spokesman for Kosovo\u2019s energy distribution company, KEDS, told Reuters. Kosovo relies almost exclusively on coal (which is also very polluting) but consumption of up to 800 megawatts (MW) is far outstripping supply of 500MW. Reuters reports: In a statement on Sunday, KEDS said that it and the country\u2019s transmission system operator, KOSTT, could not afford to import electricity and must rely on domestic production. About 90% of the country\u2019s electricity production is from coal, and the power utility KEK has said it had shut down almost half of its generators for regular maintenance to prepare them for winter.\n\n\n\n3d ago 10.09 Oil prices have dipped further: the price of a barrel of Brent crude for October delivery is now at $96.07 \u2013 $2 down for the day. Prices are near their lowest level since markets reacted to Russia ratcheting up tension with Ukraine ahead of its invasion. The lowest point this month on 5 August was below $93, a level not seen since 21 February, three days before Vladimir Putin ordered the start of the invasion. Oil prices fell near on Monday following surprise weakness in Chinese economic data, remaining near the lowest levels since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Photograph: Refinitiv The price of West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, has also fallen further: futures prices are down 2.3%, or $2.11, to just under $90 per barrel.\n\n\n\n3d ago 09.36 The then UK chancellor Rishi Sunak (now in the race to be prime minister against Liz Truss) told MPs in February that the government\u2019s aim was to make up for half the cost of energy price increases to households. In May, the government updated the support to be worth \u00a324bn. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) lays out the \u201cfive main strands\u201d: \u00a3400 to all households labelled as an \u201cenergy discount\u201d that will be subtracted from energy bills.\n\n\u00a3150 for all households in council tax bands A-D (around 80% of households).\n\n\u00a3650 for any family on means-tested benefits.\n\n\u00a3300 for pensioners on means-tested benefits.\n\n\u00a3150 for those on a disability benefit. That meant that the government was covering about three-quarters of the \u00a333bn increase in energy bills that was expected then, in May. The problem is that costs have continued to surge since then, to the point that bills are expected to more than double from already elevated levels come the winter. The consultancy Cornwall Insights forecasts that bills could rise to \u00a34,266 in January and \u00a34,426 in April before easing somewhat \u2013 but will remain elevated until we see a proper decline in wholesale prices. Given the cap is currently \u00a31,971, it is easy to see how the price of keeping support at the same level starts to stack up.\n\nUpdated at 09.42 BST\n\n3d ago 08.48 Another \u00a312bn needed to keep UK energy bills support at same level, says IFS Mark Sweney The government needs to spend another \u00a312bn to maintain the scale of support pledged to help families cope with the cost of living crisis as the energy prices continue to soar, according to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). The economics thinktank said that the additional funding will be needed to achieve the \u00a324bn package of aid announced in May, largely because the forecast increase in energy prices over the next year has jumped from 95% to 141%. This means that working age benefit claimants are now on course to see their real income fall by \u00a3620 over the year. The IFS says that the government would need to double the current \u00a3650 grant to those on benefits to protect them, as well as help low income pensioners and families in work, at a cost of \u00a35.5bn. Similarly, the cost of maintaining the \u00a3150 council tax rebate and \u00a3400 energy discount will now cost the government another \u00a37bn if it wants to continue to cover around half the increase in costs a typical family will be hit by over the year. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said: As prices of essentials including food, heating and fuel continues to rise, families on low-incomes are facing more uncertainty and pressures. The government is still playing catch up as inflation and the cost of energy continue to spiral upwards. Just achieving what they wanted to achieve back in May will cost an additional \u00a312bn, and a package on that scale will still leave many households much worse off.\n\n\n\n3d ago 08.25 The FTSE 100 has gained 0.3% in the first minutes of trading in this mid-August week, hitting its highest point since early June. The top gainer is RS Group, formerly known as Electrocomponents, amid speculation that it could be in line for a takeover bid. Pharma group AstraZeneca has gained 2.5% after it said that its breast cancer drug Enhertu had shown positive trial results. Elsewhere in Europe stocks are looking positive.

                "text": "Hiring in July was far better than expected, defying multiple other signs that the economic recovery is losing steam, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.\n\nNonfarm payrolls rose 528,000 for the month and the unemployment rate was 3.5%, easily topping the Dow Jones estimates of 258,000 and 3.6%, respectively. The unemployment rate is now back to its pre-pandemic level and tied for the lowest since 1969, though the rate for Blacks rose 0.2 percentage point to 6%.\n\nWage growth also surged higher, as average hourly earnings jumped 0.5% for the month and 5.2% from the same time a year ago. Those numbers add fuel to an inflation picture that already has consumer prices rising at their fastest rate since the early 1980s. The Dow Jones estimate was for a 0.3% monthly gain and 4.9% annual increase.\n\nMore broadly, though, the report showed the labor market remains strong despite other signs of economic weakness.\n\n\"There's no way to take the other side of this. There's not a lot of, 'Yeah, but,' other than it's not positive from a market or Fed perspective,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. \"For the economy, this is good news.\"\n\nMarkets initially reacted negatively to the report as traders anticipated a strong counter move from a Federal Reserve looking to cool the economy and in particular a heated labor market. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day positive, rising about 74 points following a day of choppy trading.\n\nLeisure and hospitality led the way in job gains with 96,000, though the industry is still 1.2 million workers shy of its pre-pandemic level.\n\nProfessional and business services was next with 89,000. Health care added 70,000 and government payrolls grew 57,000. Goods-producing industries also posted solid gains, with construction up 32,000 and manufacturing adding 30,000.\n\nRetail jobs increased by 22,000, despite repeated warnings from executives at Walmart, Target and elsewhere that consumer demand is shifting.\n\nA more encompassing view of unemployment that includes those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons as well as discouraged workers not looking for jobs was unchanged at 6.7%.",

                "text": "The politics of Labour\u2019s plan to freeze energy bills for all households this winter are simple. With Boris Johnson\u2019s government in its death throes and the two candidates to succeed him at loggerheads over what to do, Sir Keir Starmer has come up with proposals that are big, costed and timely. They will put pressure on Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak to come up with something equally ambitious.\n\nThe economics of the package are less clear cut, and have already been attacked by critics on the left and the right.\n\nBroadly, the plan involves freezing the energy price cap at its current level of just under \u00a32,000 a year rather than allowing it to rise in line with global wholesale gas prices. Left unchecked, it is estimated the price cap will rise to more than \u00a33,500 a year in October and to well over \u00a34,000 a year in January.\n\nLabour says the plan would cost just shy of \u00a330bn, although that\u2019s on the assumption that it would apply only for the next six months. There is, however, no guarantee that the energy crisis will be over by next spring, and some analysts believe prices may stay high for years.\n\nGas prices were already rising before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, but the war has pushed the cost of energy sharply higher, and there is no sign of the conflict ending soon. As with the furlough scheme introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic, \u00a330bn may be simply a downpayment on a much bigger bill.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are two issues here: would an expanded windfall tax actually net \u00a38bn, and if it did, would it only do so by disincentivising investment?\n\nLabour says one advantage of its plan is that it will reduce the annual inflation rate, now 9.4%, but projected by the Bank of England to rise above 13% when the new price cap is introduced in October. As Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, points out, inflation will come down in the short term but will rise again once the six-month scheme ends unless global gas prices fall.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of whether support should be targeted rather than provided to all. Wealthy households who could afford to pay higher prices will be treated the same as poorer households who are facing a choice between eating and heating.\n\nThis has obvious political attractions, but an alternative to Labour\u2019s universal plan would have been to use the benefits system to provide help for those who need it, perhaps by increasing the generosity of universal credit. Instead the scheme encourages better-off people to use more energy, which sits oddly with weaning the UK off fossil fuels and the drive to be a net-zero-carbon economy by 2050.\n\nFinally, the proposals are limited to consumers, despite the fact that businesses face painful \u2013 and in some cases ruinous \u2013 increases in their energy bills from October. Small businesses look especially vulnerable.\n\nGiven that there is no immediate prospect of an election, Starmer will not have to implement his proposals and can say Labour\u2019s plan is a short-term response to the cost of living crisis that is looming this winter. In that sense, politics matters more than economics. But it is conceivable that some of what the opposition is calling for will be picked up. Throughout this crisis, ministers have savaged Labour\u2019s plans \u2013 over a windfall tax, for example \u2013 only to steal them later.",

                "text": "LONDON \u2014 The average cost of a pint of beer in the U.K. has soared by 70% since 2008 \u2014 well ahead of inflation \u2014 and some Londoners are parting with as much as \u00a38 ($9.70) for 568ml of the amber nectar. According to figures from consultancy firm CGA, the average cost of a pint has risen from \u00a32.30 in 2008 to \u00a33.95 in 2022, though prices vary drastically across locations. Average prices rose by 15 pence between 2021 and 2022, up almost 4%, one of the largest year-on-year increases since 2008. The average price of a pint at one unnamed pub in London hit an eye-watering \u00a38.06 this year, the highest CGA has ever recorded, while the lowest nationally was a \u00a31.79 average at a pub in Lancashire, in the northwest of England. U.K. inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.4% in June and is expected to rise beyond 13% in October, compounding the country's historic cost-of-living crisis and prompting the Bank of England to implement its largest interest rate hike since 1995 on Thursday. Many pubs and hospitality venues are concerned that consumers will increasingly stay at home. Paul Bolton, client director for GB drinks at CGA, told CNBC that a combination of supply chain issues, staffing shortages, soaring energy costs, lingering pandemic-era debts and generally high inflation are increasing suppliers' cost pressures, which then have to be passed onto the consumer. Raw materials and energy Francois Sonneville, senior beverage analyst at Rabobank, told CNBC that prices are increasing throughout the value chain, starting with barley. \"The barley price has gone up, and has doubled since 2021. There's two reasons for that: one is that the harvest in North America was really poor, driven by a poor climate, so there was not much inventory to start with \u2013 and then, of course, we had the Black Sea region conflict,\" he told CNBC's Arabile Gumede.\n\nA pint of Adnams Ghost Ship Citrus pale Ale. The Suffolk-based brewer says a combination of soaring energy, labor and raw material costs is squeezing businesses and driving up the price of a pint. Geography Photos/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nHistorically, when grain prices increased, farmers would compensate by planting more the following year, but broader agricultural inflation is also putting a squeeze on farms, outpacing even the 40-year high of 9.4% headline inflation in the U.K. \"Where our normal inflation is running at 8, 9%, (agricultural) inflation for our businesses is running somewhere over 22, 23%,\" explained Richard Hirst, owner of Hirst Farms in Suffolk. \"That's a function of obviously oil prices, fuel \u2013 our tractor diesel has gone up more than three times in price, which is a lot more, relatively, than road fuel has gone up.\" Hirst said the farm is also facing substantial labor cost increases, with shortages affecting the farming industry nationwide, along with fertilizer costs. \"Fertilizer costs will have tripled for next year \u2013 we're buying fertilizer now three times what it was last year. Our chemical inputs are going up and just the cost of running machinery, whether it's spare parts or actually just the cost of buying machinery itself. All that has gone up an awful lot more than the 9 or 10% of normal inflation.\"\n\nHowever, barley is not the main cost incurred during the brewing process \u2013 in fact, it only contributes around 5% of the price of beer at the tap. The biggest costs, analysts and business leaders told CNBC, come from labor, packaging and energy. \"I think that if you look at the brewing process itself, it uses a lot of energy \u2013 and the energy price has gone up, as we all know, when we stop at the pump \u2013 but the most important one is probably packaging,\" Sonneville said. \"Packaging makes up about 25 to 30% of the cost price of beer, and glass packaging, glass bottles, use about 25% of their cost in energy, so with gas prices going 10 times higher now than they were two years ago, that has a massive impact on the cost of a brewer.\" Labor of love His comments were echoed by Andy Wood, CEO of Suffolk-based brewery and hospitality business Adnams, who told CNBC that the energy price increases the company is seeing are \"absolutely eye-watering.\" \"Brewing beer or distilling spirits involves a lot of boiling water, so that involves lots of energy to get to that state, although we've put quite a number of innovations in over the years to limit the impact of that,\" he explained. Wood said in the aftermath of Brexit and the pandemic, a tightening of the U.K. labor market is also exerting upward wage pressure, which will likely be exacerbated by the country's escalating cost-of-living crisis. \"The biggest cost that we have is our payroll because the hospitality part of that business is a people-driven business,\" he added. What's more, the geopolitical headwinds facing businesses throughout the supply chain are unlikely to abate any time soon.\n\n\"So we've got Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we've got the energy crisis that that's brought on, we've got the food supply crisis, grain, cooking oils, these types of things, and then \u2026 we hear in the media that China may be looking longingly at Taiwan, so I think the geopolitical situation is getting no easier, so I think these things are here to stay,\" he said. The question for businesses, according to both Wood and Sonneville, is how many of these costs they can absorb, how much should be passed onto consumers, and in the midst of a cost of living crisis, how to sustain margins without forcing the consumer to stay at home and jeopardizing volumes. Brewers tend to have long-term contracts and hedges in place to ensure contingency plans for future price rises, meaning not all of their costs are fully reflected at present, and therefore not immediately passed onto consumers. \"I think if you look at the price of beer that you and I pay, there is a risk that that will go higher, because there is a lagging effect of costs at the brewery because of those long-term contracts,\" Sonneville said on Monday. \"The hope that I think is there at brewers is that prices will come down. We have not seen that in gas \u2014 we've seen more sanctions there and gas prices have actually risen in the last three days \u2014 but we have seen that grain prices have come off a little bit, and the hope is that that will continue.\" Shifting trends Wood noted that consumer sentiment and behavior had already begun to shift in the face of higher prices at the bar. \"We're certainly seeing people come out earlier in the evening, having their drinks, having their dinner, and then they're going back home,\" he said. \"We're seeing people perhaps having two courses rather than three courses, and perhaps having a glass of wine rather than a bottle of wine, so we are seeing some changes in consumer behavior, there is no doubt about that.\" This was reflected in CGA's latest consumer analysis, which found that premium products and venues offering particularly unique experiences were increasing their share of the on-trade.",

The firm said it sees more than 40% potential upside for the stock, especially if consumers trade down in a recession.\n\nDisney \u2013 Shares of the entertainment company gained 2.22% after Daniel Loeb's Third Point took a new stake in the giant.

The firm took a bearish stance on the used car industry as well, seeing it struggling in a potential recession.\n\nUnity, AppLovin \u2013 Unity Software fell 7.13% after the company announced that it was rejecting an unsolicited takeover offer from AppLovin. As part of the decision, Unity is continuing with its previously announced acquisition of ironSource. Shares of AppLovin dropped 7.63%.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond \u2013 Shares of Bed Bath and Beyond spiked 23.88% amid a continued meme stock trading frenzy that's lifted shares of the retailer.

The company reported quarterly results that missed on both profit and revenue and issued an outlook that disappointed analysts.\n\nSeagen \u2013 Seagen slipped nearly 1% after the company announced an arbitrator had ruled in favor of Daiichi Sankyo, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, in an argument over drug technology.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Michelle Fox, Yun Li, Jesse Pound and Tanaya Macheel contributed reporting.",

                "text": "Either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak will become the next prime minister after Tory MPs put them into the final round of the Conservative leadership election. Here we look at how they differ on key areas of policy.\n\nEconomy and cost of living\n\nLiz Truss has said her \u201cfirst port of call\u201d \u2013 for the economy and help with energy bills \u2013 will be tax cuts. She has pledged to reverse the recent national insurance rate rise, which was designed to fund health and social care, to be paid for by fiscal headroom and a delay to paying off debt accrued during the Covid pandemic.\n\nTruss has not ruled out specific help for energy bills, while refusing to set out what this may involve, beyond a suspension of green levies, costing about \u00a3150 a year on the average bill. She has more generally said she dislikes \u201chandouts\u201d and prefers people to keep more of their own money.\n\nA tax cuts-based economic policy would disproportionately help those who are better off and do nothing for pensioners or those out of work. But Truss has insisted her plan for a low tax, low regulation approach would boost economic growth and help everyone in the longer term.\n\nRishi Sunak has promised \u201ca return to traditional Conservative economic values\u201d, a position seen variously as an appeal to instinctive Tory fiscal prudence, or a desire to return to \u201causterity economics\u201d. When challenged with claims he was a \u201chigh-tax chancellor\u201d, he took aim at other candidates offering \u201ccomforting fairytales\u201d rather than face the hard economic reality. He has said he aims to cut taxes but wants to tackle inflation first.\n\nHowever, later in the race to No 10, he promised to scrap VAT on household fuel bills for a year. The handout would be worth \u00a3160 for every household.\n\nSunak has also promised to lower taxes by 20% by the end of the decade, more specifically that he would cut the basic rate of income tax to 16p if the Conservatives are re-elected in 2024.\n\n00:58 Liz Truss: 'My tax cuts will decrease inflation' \u2013 video\n\nClimate\n\nTruss has committed to maintaining the government\u2019s legally binding goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050, but has said she would suspend green energy levies.\n\nShe is backed by the energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, who is relatively strong on renewable energy, and another backer, Vicky Ford, says she was very supportive of Cop26.\n\nSunak would set a new legal target for the UK to be energy independent by 2045 at the latest and has committed to maintaining the government\u2019s legally binding goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and has assured the Tories\u2019 green wing he would protect the environment.\n\nInsiders say Sunak was resistant to spending money on climate measures when he ran the Treasury. He has, however, previously spoken out in support of net zero and made the case for a greener economy.\n\nEducation\n\nTruss has bemoaned the quality of the state school she attended, which critics swiftly pointed out occurred under Conservative governments, and has promised to give everyone \u201cthe same opportunities\u201d so they are \u201cable to know that the town they are born in has opportunity\u201d.\n\nTruss has also said that every student who achieves three A* grades at A-level should be offered an admissions interview at either Oxford or Cambridge.\n\nSunak supporters Nick Gibb and Damian Hinds, both of whom have served as ministers in the Department for Education, laid out Sunak\u2019s approach to schooling in a column in the Times. The education system will be \u201cfocused on excellence and delivering the skills and knowledge needed for the world of tomorrow\u201d, they wrote. He plans to help the best multi-academy trusts to expand, and fulfil a commitment to establish high-quality post-16 specialist free schools outside London and the south-east.\n\nHome affairs\n\nTruss has reportedly said she would attempt to expand the Rwanda removal scheme to countries such as Turkey, and has called it \u201ccompletely moral\u201d.\n\nShe has pledged to bring back national crime targets \u2013 committing to a 20% reduction in murders, other violence and burglaries within two years if she became prime minister.\n\nTruss has also promised to crack down on violence against women and girls. Under her plans, a standalone offence to criminalise street harassment would be introduced alongside a national domestic abuse register, which would include coercive and controlling behaviour and financial abuse.\n\n01:05 Rishi Sunak says Tories must 'make Rwanda policy work' \u2013 video\n\nSunak supports the Rwanda removal scheme, though sources have briefed that he opposed it as chancellor over the \u00a3120m cost. He has promised a \u201ccrackdown on grooming gangs\u201d and has pledged to create a requirement for all police forces to have a ringfenced child sexual exploitation team.\n\nLevelling up\n\nTruss has also committed to continuing the levelling up agenda but added she would do this in a \u201cConservative way\u201d. Commentators have suggested this means a focus on tax cuts and deregulation, rather than high spending and investment.\n\nSunak picked up the endorsement of the Tory Tees valley mayor, Ben Houchen, as well as a host of \u201cred wall\u201d MPs over his levelling up pledges. He has committed to maintaining a cabinet-level secretary of state for levelling up. Houchen said he was encouraged by Sunak\u2019s interest in the levelling up agenda.\n\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday morning at 7am BST\n\nThe NHS\n\nTruss is expected to give more detailed policy announcements on the NHS, but she has said she is \u201ccompletely committed\u201d to government promises for NHS spending.\n\nOne particular area where she faces questions is how she will find money to pay for and tackle the Covid-related NHS backlog given that she has pledged to reverse the national insurance rise introduced to fund this and other costs.\n\nSunak is pledging to create a \u201cvaccines style\u201d taskforce dedicated to tackling NHS backlogs. He plans to eliminate one-year waiting times six months earlier than planned by September 2024, and to get overall numbers falling by next year.\n\nHe is warning of \u201cprivatisation by the back door\u201d as a result of people who are spending money they can\u2019t afford to go private due to the size of waiting lists.\n\nBrexit\n\nTruss has vowed to review all EU laws retained after Brexit by the end of next year, and to scrap or replace those that are deemed to hinder UK growth.\n\nTruss was a remainer in the referendum campaign but has since become a keen convert to Brexit. She has led negotiations with Brussels over subsequent disagreements and is pushing new legislation that would unilaterally rewrite Britain\u2019s post-Brexit commitments to the EU over Northern Ireland.\n\nSunak came out early for Brexit in the run-up to the referendum. He has reportedly backed proposals on the \u201cNorthern Ireland protocol\u201d and, as chancellor, promoted \u201cfreeports\u201d around Britain as one way of benefiting from Brexit. He has committed to a bonfire of EU laws that are \u201cgetting in the way\u201d of British businesses.\n\nImmigration\n\nTruss\u2019s main pitch is ensuring the removal of some asylum seekers to Rwanda goes ahead, and she has pledged to deliver it by reforming the UK\u2019s relationship with the European convention on human rights. The foreign secretary also wants to increase Border Force capacity by 20%, to increase patrols in the Channel and explore \u201call possible turnaround tactics\u201d. An overhauled bill of rights would be used to enshrine these in law.\n\nSunak, despite having served as chancellor for more than two years, has been scathing of the immigration system \u2013 calling it broken and chaotic.\n\nHe has said the UK does not have control over its borders and so pledged to reduce the number of people granted asylum in the UK by changing the definition of who qualifies for it, allow MPs to set an annual cap on the number of refugees accepted each year and pursue further Rwanda-style removal plans with other countries.\n\nHe would also withhold aid from countries that do not receive refused asylum seekers and criminals.\n\nMedia\n\nTruss is also believed to support privatisation of Channel 4, although she has yet to publicly make her position clear. The sale of Channel 4 is strongly supported by the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, who is a vocal Truss supporter.\n\nSunak will proceed with the sale of Channel 4, saying privatisation would help the broadcaster compete with big streaming firms. Plans for privatisation are expected to be ready when parliament returns \u2013 under a new prime minister \u2013 in the autumn.\n\nForeign policy and defence\n\nBefore the leadership race, Truss set out her vision in May of a more assertive G7, which she wanted to be \u201cmore institutionalised\u201d and turned into an \u201ceconomic Nato\u201d that can defend its members from Chinese economic coercion.\n\nAs foreign secretary, she has been at the forefront of Britain\u2019s more hawkish position on Russia, in comparison with Ukraine\u2019s other western allies. She is promising to spend 3% of GDP on defence.\n\nBoth candidates have yet to set out any big new foreign policy positions during the campaign, although Sunak will be eager to shore up his credentials in this area and emphasise his G7 role brokering a minimum global corporation tax rate.\n\nHaving lived and worked in the US, Sunak is regarded as a committed Atlanticist and Eurosceptic. In terms of defence spending, Sunak has expressed opposition to \u201carbitrary targets\u201d.\n\nScotland\n\nTruss, when asked if she would agree to a request for a second Scottish independence referendum under any circumstances, said this week: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThe last referendum in 2014 was described as a once-in-a-generation referendum. We\u2019re now in 2022 \u2013 that is not a generation ago.\u201d\n\nSunak has said he would try to make an \u201cemotional argument for the United Kingdom from the heart, as well as the practical argument for it and demonstrating it\u201d.\n\nHe has promised to rule out a second referendum on Scottish independence. However, in 2017 he said it would be \u201chard\u201d to block a second vote on Scottish independence, and that it should be pushed back until after Brexit.\n\nStrikes\n\nTruss has promised a further crackdown on trade unions, widening restrictions to a significant new number of industries.\n\nTruss said she would legislate for minimum service levels on critical national infrastructure in the first 30 days of government under her leadership. The pledge would go further than the Tories\u2019 2019 policy, which promised a minimum service should operate during transport strikes.\n\nThe new law proposed by Truss would restrict teachers, postal workers and the energy sector. Tailored minimum thresholds, including staffing levels, would be determined with each industry.\n\nWhitehall\n\nTruss has announced a string of reforms of the civil service, which she claims will cut the \u201cbureaucracy and inefficiency\u201d of Whitehall.\n\nThese reforms include the scrapping of civil service roles that focus on diversity and inclusion, and she will cap the median amount of annual leave public sector workers are entitled to, to 25 days. She also says she will defund the paid time off that public sector trade union officials can take to carry out union duties.\n\nSunak has not officially announced any policies regarding Whitehall yet, but in December it was reported that as chancellor, he was drawing up plans to cut tens of thousands of Whitehall jobs.",

                "text": "\u201cOn the surface, this is good news for the Fed,\u201d said Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights. \u201cThis is the first baby step toward the moderation they want to see on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nInflation F.A.Q. Card 1 of 5 Inflation F.A.Q. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. Inflation F.A.Q. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Inflation F.A.Q. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. Inflation F.A.Q. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Inflation F.A.Q. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFed officials remain committed to wrestling America\u2019s rapid inflation lower, and they have raised interest rates at the quickest pace since the 1980s to try to slow the economy and bring supply and demand into balance \u2014 making supersize rate moves of three-quarters of a percentage point at each of their past two meetings. Another big adjustment will be up for debate at their next meeting in September, policymakers have said.\n\nBut investors interpreted July\u2019s unexpectedly pronounced inflation slowdown as a sign that policymakers could take a gentler route, raising rates a half-point next month. Stocks soared more than 2 percent on Wednesday, as Wall Street bet that the Fed might become less aggressive, which would decrease the chances that it would plunge the economy into a recession.\n\n\u201cIt was as good as the markets and the Fed could have hoped for from this report,\u201d said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies. \u201cI do think it removes the urgency for the Fed.\u201d\n\nStill, officials who spoke on Wednesday remained cautious about inflation. Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, called the report the \u201cfirst hint\u201d of a move in the right direction, while Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that it was \u201cpositive\u201d but that price increases remained \u201cunacceptably high.\u201d\n\nPolicymakers have been hoping for more than a year that price increases will begin to cool, only to have those expectations repeatedly dashed. Supply chain issues have made goods more expensive, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sent commodity prices soaring, a shortage of workers pushed wages and service prices higher and a dearth of housing has fueled rising rents.",

Because we're not just dealing with economic issues like inflation and lapping stimulus and things like that. But also the social issues of people returning to mobility after lockdown, working from home and just the change in consumer patterns.\"\n\nThree months earlier, during the company's prior call with analysts, Gibbs said economists who call this a \"K-shaped recovery,\" where high-income consumers are doing fine while lower-income householders struggle, are oversimplifying the situation.\n\n\"I don't know in my career we've seen a more complex environment to analyze consumer behavior than what we're dealing with right now,\" he said in May, citing inflation, rising wages and federal stimulus spending that's still stoking the economy.\n\nAt the same time, societal issues like the post-Covid reopening and Russia's war in Ukraine are weighing on consumer sentiment, which all \"makes for a pretty complex environment to figure out how to analyze it and market to consumers,\" Gibbs said.\n\nGibbs is right. Things are very strange. Is a recession coming or not?\n\nThere is ample evidence for the \"yes\" camp.\n\nTech and finance are bracing for a downturn with hiring slowdowns and job cuts and pleas for more efficiency from workers. The stock market has been on a nine-month slump with the tech-heavy Nasdaq off more than 20% from its November peak and many high-flying tech stocks down 60% or more.\n\nInflation is causing consumers to spend less on nonessential purchases like clothing so they can afford gas and food.

                "text": "Boris Johnson should intervene urgently to start insulating British homes and introduce fiscal policies to reduce bills, as further delay will mean more people face \u201cextreme suffering\u201d this winter as energy bills soar, a former government chief scientific adviser has warned.\n\nDavid King said: \u201cThis could be the worst possible time for the leadership of this country to be simply sitting back. We\u2019re waiting until what? We have an energy crisis right now and we need good leadership. We need alert leadership, leadership that is thinking about this \u2013 and that is missing.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who has vowed to take no major decisions in his remaining time in office, attended a meeting of energy companies last week that had no conclusive outcome, and is now on his second holiday since resigning last month.\n\nKing told the Guardian: \u201cHe is the prime minster. He wanted to stay on, so he must deliver as prime minister. There is no one else who can do that.\u201d\n\nHe called for higher taxes on energy companies, which he said were riding soaring energy prices since the Ukraine invasion for a bonanza, rather than investing or becoming more efficient. \u201cThey are taking bigger and bigger profits, as the prices are so high. That can only mean that they are tying their profits to the price, not the volume they are delivering,\u201d he said.\n\nKing \u2013 a former government chief scientist and UK climate envoy from 2000 to 2007, and as the government\u2019s special representative on climate from 2013 to 2017 he was an adviser to prime ministers and foreign secretaries including Johnson \u2013 said valuable time had been wasted while the government failed to act.\n\nWaiting several more weeks for a new Conservative leader to take the reins of government would only add to the problem, he said. \u201cThere will be extreme suffering, at the lower-paid end of our society,\u201d King warned. \u201cWe need fiscal policies that help people in the lower-paid bracket, that manage the costs of energy.\u201d\n\nHe said home insulation must also be a priority. \u201cInsulating homes is a massive benefit to individuals and the country at large. Home insulation programmes have always been on the back burner for government for such a long time, though the benefits are enormous.\u201d\n\nEven starting now would help people across the country with bills, he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s never too late \u2013 if you start now, we could see good progress before winter.\u201d\n\nKeir Starmer, the Labour leader, will announce new proposals on Monday for how to deal with the UK\u2019s home insulation problem, while calling for the energy bill cap to be retained at its current \u00a31.971, according to a report in the Observer on Sunday.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rishi Sunak, the other leadership hopeful, proposed to cut VAT on energy bills and offer support to bill payers. \u201cThe big beneficiaries of low tax are people who can already afford higher energy prices,\u201d he said.\n\nKing also criticised the government for turning to increased production of oil and gas in the North Sea to lower energy bills, a move he said would do nothing to alleviate high gas prices and would lock in high greenhouse gas emissions for decades.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely the wrong timescale \u2013 it will take 10 or 20 years for new oil and gas projects [started now] to come online,\u201d he warned.\n\nThe Climate Crisis Advisory Group, an international coalition of scientists chaired by King, will publish a report this week arguing that governments do not need to return to fossil fuels in response to rising gas prices and energy shortages.\n\nInternational cooperation, expanding investment in renewable energy as well as pursuing energy efficiency through home insulation and in industries would be enough to limit the energy crisis, the report says. Interest rate rises should also be avoided as that would risk a damaging recession.\n\n\u201cThe remaining global carbon budget of around 400 gigatonnes of CO 2 simply does not allow new fossil fuel expansion,\u201d the report says. \u201cA fossil-fuel rush is simply an unsustainable position and is a big mistake.\u201d\n\nCritics sometimes argue that renewable energy is variable and intermittent \u2013 but King says overhauling energy grids and diversifying clean sources of power would solve this problem.\n\n\u201cOffshore wind is very reliable, as the wind blows a very large percentage of the time from the North Sea,\u201d he added. Hydropower in some areas could be used to store energy in dams for release when wind was low.\n\nNuclear energy also has a part to play, in the UK and around the world, according to King. He said Germany should return to nuclear power, instead of reviving its coal-fired power stations.\n\n\u201cI worry about the fact that the fossil fuel lobby has been amazingly powerful,\u201d in the UK and other countries, King said. Ministers had delayed again a decision on a potential new coalmine in Cumbria, which King warned could be approved by the next prime minister on the \u201cexcuse\u201d of energy security.\n\nIn the US, important climate legislation was passed last week that will provide hundreds of billions of dollars in funding to key technologies, but owing to pressure from the fossil fuel lobby it still contains sops to gas and oil production. \u201cThe power of the fossil-fuel lobby has been such that the US has never been able to play a leading role in negotiations on the climate,\u201d King said.",

At the same time, many airlines cut the number of flights on their summer schedules to reduce the risk of mass delays and cancellations because of weather and staffing problems especially around holidays and other peak travel days.

                "text": "Initial claims for unemployment insurance totaled 260,000 last week, near the highest level since November amid a shift in the U.S. labor market. The total for the week ended July 30 was in line with the Dow Jones estimate but a gain of 6,000 from the previous week's downwardly revised level, the Labor Department reported Thursday. In other economic news, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services decreased to $79.6 billion in June, down $5.3 billion and slightly lower than the estimate for $80 billion. The jobless claims number comes a day before the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its much anticipated nonfarm payrolls report for July. That is expected the show the U.S. economy added 258,000 positions in the month, compared with the 372,000 initial June estimate and the lowest total since December 2020.\n\nA sign for hire is posted on the window of a Chipotle restaurant in New York, April 29, 2022. Shannon Stapleton | Reuters\n\n\"The labor market remains in good shape as the summer quarter progresses but the rise in initial claims since early April is a cold breeze blowing at the hot labor market this summer,\" said Stuart Hoffman, senior economic advisor at PNC Financial Services. Federal Reserve officials are watching the jobs market closely for clues about an economy that is showing the highest inflation rate in more than 40 years. Jobless claims had been running around their lowest levels since the late 1960s but started ticking higher in June as inflation pressures swelled and companies started cutting back on hires. Even with robust hiring in 2021 and the first half of 2022, the total employment level is 755,000 below where it was in February 2020, the last month before the Covid pandemic hit. The four-week moving average of jobless claims, which smooths out weekly volatility, reflects the shift in the jobs market. That number rose 6,000 from the previous week to 254,750, up sharply from the recent low of 170,500 on April 2 and the highest level of the year. Continuing claims, which run a week behind the headline number, totaled 1.42 million, up 48,000 from the prior week and 83,000 from the beginning of July.\n\nTrade deficit comes off record high",

It's a buffered ETF using a risk reversal strategy to minimize downside while also putting a cap on gains.\n\n\"You buy TSLH, hedge Tesla, you get basically 10% on the upside, and you have a 10% floor,\" Bond explained on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" last week. \"Now what a floor is \u2013 that's a max loss of 10%. If Tesla goes down 20%, you lose 10%. If it goes down 50%, you lose 10%.\"\n\nTreasury bills make up about 90% of the hedged fund \"to construct a potential floor against significant losses on a quarterly basis,\" Innovator ETFs reported in the ETF launch news release. \"A call option spread on TSLA using FLEX options\" makes up the remainder of the fund's portfolio.\n\n\"The projected upside cap for the balance of the current calendar quarter (through September) is 8.70%,\" the company also said.\n\nIts floor resets each calendar quarter but will never surpass 10%, Bond explained to CNBC, noting the ETF's floor rested at 9.23% when it launched.\n\nThe Innovator Hedged TSLA Strategy ETF is up 5% since its launch on July 26. Meanwhile, Tesla shares are up 12% in the same time period.\n\nIt's not the first time Bond's company launched an ETF using this risk reversal strategy.\n\nInnovator ETFs started the Innovator Defined Wealth Shield ETF (BALT) last year that focusing the S&P 500 index.\n\nBut the strategy is under fire by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler released a statement not long after addressing risks that may stem from \"complex\" exchange-traded products such as leveraged or inverse ETFs, emphasizing potential issues with their short-term nature.\n\n\"These ETPs, however, can pose risks even to sophisticated investors, and can potentially create system-wide risks by operating in unanticipated ways when markets experience volatility or stress conditions,\" Gensler's Oct. 2021 statement said,\n\nGensler proposed \"potential rulemaking\" to help protect individual investors. However, Bond defended Innovator ETFs' products, suggesting buffers offer significant risk control value.\n\nThe SEC declined to provide a statement.",

                "text": "Reading and watching the media over the past year, you might be forgiven for thinking that we are facing the collapse of civilisation. We have a shrinking economy, a fuel crisis that may bring on energy rationing and forced blackouts, extreme weather events, the increased chance of nuclear war, and risk of the growth of a new pandemic riding on the back of the last. The Doomsday Clock \u2013 a symbol created by scientists to represent the likelihood of a human-made catastrophe \u2013 places us at just 100 seconds before midnight, the closest we\u2019ve been to Armageddon in the project\u2019s 75-year history.\n\nIn the face of these threats, it may be hard to maintain a rose-tinted view of the future \u2013 unless, that is, you are the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker. In 2018, his book Enlightenment Now argued that our interpretations of news events make us far too gloomy. There has never been a better time to be alive, he said, thanks to the social, economic, political, technological, and medical advances of the past 300 years.\n\nAt the time of its publication, Pinker\u2019s book attracted as much scorn as praise. One common criticism was that he had oversimplified complex subjects and neglected any phenomena that might suggest a lack of progress. Pinker has, however, attempted to address many of the criticisms, and the recent challenges facing the world do not appear to have changed his opinion.\n\nOn Radio 4\u2019s Today programme last week, he revisited the arguments of Enlightenment Now to explain why he believes there are still reasons to remain optimistic in 2022. \u201cWe have to remember that there\u2019s no law of nature that spaces bad things apart,\u201d he said. \u201cBad things happen, and they will appear to come in clusters \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re being punished for our collective sins or that we\u2019re in a uniquely dangerous moment.\u201d He maintains humanity has the tools to deal with the challenges we face.\n\nThere is certainly something comforting about seeing cause for hope in crises. But do we really have good grounds for optimism? To find out, the Observer examines four indices of progress and the ways they have been affected by recent events.\n\nHealth in the time of Covid\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic is the obvious place to start. According to the World Health Organization, more than 6.4 million have so far died of the infection, since the virus emerged. In a sample of 37 countries, the British Medical Journal found all but six had experienced a reduction in life expectancy as a result. That\u2019s not to mention the burden of long Covid, which is thought to affect around two million people in the UK alone.\n\nPinker\u2019s 2018 book Enlightenment Now attracted scorn from some quarters when it was published, but the author continues to defend its message. Photograph: Geoffroy van der Hasselt/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThis is certainly a step backwards for global health. But it is worth noting that Pinker has never claimed that we will see continuous progress without any setbacks. His argument is more concerned with the ways we cope with problems and find potential solutions. Did we deal with the threat better than we would have been able to in years gone by?\n\nThe jury is still out on the UK government\u2019s initial response to the crisis. But the rapid development of Covid vaccines is undoubtedly a triumph of scientific progress. According to a recent study from Imperial College\u2019s Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, the vaccination programme saved at least 14 million people \u2013 and potentially as many as 19.8 million \u2013 in its first year.\n\nThis simply wouldn\u2019t have been possible in years gone by; all previous vaccines had taken at least five years to develop, and at the start of the pandemic many scientists believed the possibility of creating a new one from scratch was naively optimistic. That may be some cause of optimism for our ability to deal with future health threats.\n\nWealth and happiness\n\nOne of Enlightenment Now\u2019s core arguments is that people today are far wealthier than people in previous decades \u2013 and that this has resulted in higher life satisfaction, through greater comfort, more free time and better education. Pinker dismisses the idea that inequality is a driver of unrest \u2013 it is each person\u2019s absolute wealth that matters, he says, which means we do not need to worry too much if much of a country\u2019s gains in GDP go disproportionately to the richest echelons of society.\n\nThe evidence for this is not quite as clearcut as Pinker would claim, however. Recent research by veteran economist Richard Easterlin found that China\u2019s and India\u2019s recent economic growth have done very little for the population\u2019s overall happiness. More comprehensively, a study by Ma\u0142gorzata Mikucka at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium analysed life satisfaction in 46 countries from 1981 to 2012. It found that an increase in GDP only brought about greater happiness if it was accompanied by reduced inequality and increased social capital.\n\nNone of this bodes well for our lives over the next few months and years. The Office for National Statistics has just reported that the UK\u2019s GDP has shrunk in the second quarter of 2022, suggesting that we are on the brink of a recession, while the average salary is set to fall behind inflation by 8% this year \u2013 the biggest drop in real wages in over 100 years. And according to the International Monetary Fund, the cost of living crisis is likely to widen inequality by hitting the poorest homes hardest.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that, by the start of this year, real wages had not fully recovered from the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 suggesting that this is more than a momentary blip in our living standards.\n\nWar and peace\n\nOne of Pinker\u2019s most controversial claims concerns our propensity to kill each other. He first made the case that human violence is at an all-time low in The Better Angels of Our Nature, published in 2011, and then revisited the idea seven years later in Enlightenment Now.\n\nMuch of Pinker\u2019s argument concerns warfare. Using data concerning the sheer number of conflicts, their length, the proportion of lives lost, and the level of military investment, Pinker notes a downward trend across the centuries. Clearly, there are exceptions \u2013 the huge numbers of lives lost in both world wars, for one; you can only reach his conclusion by looking at average numbers across the globe over large time periods.\n\nPinker argues that various forces \u2013 such as the increasing importance of international trade, the rise of democracy, and the actions of institutions such as the UN \u2013 have made war much less desirable for most leaders, pushing us into the period known by some historians as the \u201clong peace\u201d.\n\nThe war in Ukraine challenges Pinker\u2019s view that human society has, historically speaking, entered a \u2018long peace\u2019. Photograph: Anatolii Stepanov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut many other scholars have questioned these conclusions. One analysis by Aaron Clauset at the University of Colorado in Boulder, for example, concluded that the \u201clong peace\u201d may just be a statistical fluke. It is possible for any probabilistic events to cluster in certain periods and to disappear in others. For an analogy, consider how many times you can throw a coin and it lands on tails, despite the probability being 50:50. You might conclude that the coin is biased \u2013 but with more throws the overall frequencies will tend to balance out. According to Clauset\u2019s paper, the \u201clong peace\u201d may be similarly ephemeral.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and growing tensions over Taiwan, have of course placed the thought of global war at the front of everyone\u2019s minds. We can hope that diplomacy will prevent disaster, but optimistic historical analyses provide cold comfort when our fate can depend on the erratic decisions of dictators such as Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe environment\n\nWith the record-breaking heatwaves this year, and the threat of wildfires sweeping across the UK, it feels like we are already witnessing the start of the climate emergency \u2013 and unless we take drastic action, it is only set to worsen.\n\nPinker certainly doesn\u2019t deny climate change, which he acknowledges is a \u201cgargantuan problem\u201d, but he has criticised \u201ceco-pessimism\u201d and the prevalence of what he considers to be alarmist green messaging. In Enlightenment Now, he describes many environmental successes, such as the reduction of water pollution, the elimination of acid rain and a recent deceleration in deforestation. He points to data showing that many countries\u2019 CO 2 emissions are now plateauing. For an escape route from disaster, he points to ideas such as carbon taxing, combined with a reliance on nuclear power and technologies such as carbon capture, which involves scrubbing CO 2 from power stations before it is released and locking it underground.\n\nClimate Change is a gargantuan problem, but the idea it threatens imminent human extinction or destruction of civilization is pernicious. It's not what the science says; it's emotionally destructive; & it discourages action (why bother if we're doomed?) https://t.co/oTybFKUKom \u2014 Steven Pinker (@sapinker) August 23, 2021\n\nNeedless to say, the \u201ceco-pessimists\u201d are unimpressed. Technologies such as carbon capture do offer some promise, but their efficacy is unproven. And we will also require strong political will, which has been far from obvious in the years since Pinker\u2019s book was published. A UN report from 2021 found most governments were \u201cnowhere close to the level of ambition needed to limit climate change to 1.5C and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement\u201d, though it is possible that a drive to reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas could galvanise efforts to switch to renewables.\n\nPinker\u2019s optimism relies on the fact that we \u2013 and our governments \u2013 will act rationally, according to the Enlightenment principles of reason, science and humanism. Our combined brainpower may certainly have the capacity to solve the climate crisis, but to believe that our politicians will take action in time \u2013 that may require a leap of faith.\n\nDavid Robson is the author of The Expectation Effect: How Your Mindset Can Transform Your Life",

Mr. Boatwright added that the company had carried out a number of changes to ensure compliance with the law, such as new time-keeping technology, and that Chipotle looked forward to \u201ccontinuing to promote the goals of predictable scheduling and access to work hours for those who want them.\u201d\n\nThe city filed an initial legal complaint in the case, involving a handful of Chipotle stores, in September 2019, then expanded the case last year to include locations across the city. At the time, the city said the company owed workers over $150 million for the scheduling violations alone. Advocates for the workers said civil penalties could far exceed that amount.",

He was 59 years old.\n\nJain, who most recently served as the president of Cantor Fitzgerald, earned an MBA at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and worked at several financial firms, including Merrill Lynch, before moving to Deutsche Bank. He served as co-CEO from 2012 to 2015.\n\nJain stepped down from his role at Deutsche before his contract ended after the bank was beset by a string of regulatory issues.\n\nHis other positions included a role as an advisor at fintech company SoFi from 2016 to 2017 and as a trustee of British charity Chance to Shine.\n\n\"He believed in hard work, meritocracy, operating outside of expectations or conventional boundaries, placing family first, standing by one's roots (having turned away many attempts to Westernize him in an industry that was often homogenous), in speaking 'at the margin' rather than delivering plain facts, in wit and wordplay, in being nonmaterialistic, and in the importance of having broad-bandwidth and being a 'scholar-athlete,'\" his family said in a statement.\n\n\"We are grateful to the many people who cared for Anshu throughout his life. For us, his legacy is tenacity, honour, and love,\" the statement said.\n\nHoward Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, also released a statement about Jain's passing.\n\n\"Anshu was the consummate professional who brought a wealth of experience and wisdom to his role as President. He will be remembered as an extraordinary leader, partner, and dear friend who will be greatly missed by all of us and by all who knew him,\" Lutnick said. \"On behalf of all our partners and employees, we extend our deepest sympathies to Anshu's family and wish them peace and healing during this difficult time.\"\n\nCorrection: This article has been updated to delete a reference to Ajit Jain, who is not related to Anshu Jain.",

We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause. Learn more about our process.\n\nMr. Schumer, who helped spearhead the measure, at one point hinted at the yearslong quest to secure its passage when he noted that it had once been called the Endless Frontier Act \u2014 one of a handful of names for the bill as it made its way through Congress.\n\n\u201cI still love that name,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said that Democrats would be ready to work with Republicans when possible,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd at today\u2019s signing, we celebrate such an accomplishment.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are hoping that the passage of the industrial policy legislation and a few other notable bills, along with falling gas prices, can help drive a turnaround for the party ahead of the midterm congressional elections in November. Democrats have faced a bleak outlook heading into the fall, with Mr. Biden suffering from dismal approval numbers amid soaring inflation and painful prices at the pump.\n\nMr. Biden is planning to sign a bill on Wednesday that would expand medical care for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits on military bases, another measure that Congress approved with bipartisan support. And on Friday, the House is expected to pass the climate, health and tax bill that cleared the Senate over the weekend, handing the president a legislative triumph that he and Democratic candidates can highlight in the weeks to come.\n\nThe effort to promote the recent series of victories comes after Mr. Biden was forced to isolate during a bout with Covid-19, followed by a rebound case. He left isolation on Sunday and then traveled on Monday to meet with survivors of the severe flooding in Kentucky, his first work trip since testing positive for the virus on July 21.",

The employment picture over the past six months is behaving nothing like an economy in a downturn, instead creating jobs at a rapid pace of nearly 460,000 a month. Research from CNBC's Steve Liesman indicates that during a typical downturn, the employment picture would be far gloomier, losing ground instead of gaining. Several charts presented during Wednesday's \"Squawk Box\" help paint the picture. The CNBC team looked at economic data going back to 1947. It indicated that when gross domestic product has been negative for six months, as is the case for 2022, payrolls fall by an average of 0.5 percentage point. But this year, the job count actually has increased by 1%.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards CNBC\n\nData from human relations software company UKG backs up that notion, with internal data that shows jobs have been created about in line with the Bureau of Labor Statistics' count.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nFinally, the Dallas Federal Reserve, in research posted Tuesday, said its analysis of multiple data points found \"that most indicators \u2014 particularly those measuring labor markets \u2014 provide strong evidence that the U.S. economy did not fall into a recession in the first quarter\" of the year. One data point the central bank's researchers looked at was real personal consumption expenditures. They found that consumption generally declined during recessions.

A signing bonus is a financial sweetener \u2014 often a lump sum of cash \u2014 that businesses offer prospective hires. Offers vary widely by company and position, and they can be quite generous. For example, Walgreens is offering a $75,000 signing bonus to pharmacists in some areas to reduce staffing shortages, according to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal. More from Personal Finance:\n\n5 ways to avoid debt collection scams\n\nTop tips to save on back to school shopping\n\nInflation Reduction Act extends $7,500 tax credit for electric cars In July, 5.2% of all job postings advertised a signing bonus, a slightly lesser share than the 5.5% peak in December but still about triple the level in July 2019, according to an analysis of internal data by career site Indeed. That suggests employers are competing to fill open jobs at a time when workers are still \"in the driver's seat,\" according to AnnElizabeth Konkel, an economist at Indeed. \"If employers could find workers a dime a dozen, I don't think they'd be using signing bonuses in this way,\" Konkel said.\n\n8 job sectors advertising the most signing bonuses\n\nThe trend is more prevalent among in-person health-care jobs, like nursing, dental, medical technicians, physicians and surgeons, and home health care, according to Indeed data. More than 10% of jobs ads in these respective categories offered a signing-bonus benefit in July. For example, the share of job listings advertising these bonuses jumped from 6% to 18% in the three years from July 2019 to July 2021, according to Indeed. Here are the top eight occupational sectors that advertised a signing bonus in July 2022, according to Indeed. Nursing: 18.1% of all job listings Driving: 15.1% Dental: 14.7% Veterinary: 13.5% Medical technician: 12.6% Physicians and surgeons: 11.4% Childcare: 11.3% Personal care and home health: 11.3%\n\n'Demand for workers is still going strong'\n\nWorkers have enjoyed the benefits of strong labor market since early 2021, when businesses were ramping up hiring as they re-opened more broadly after a pandemic-era lull. Job openings soared to record highs and wages grew at the fastest pace in decades, incentivizing employees to quit in record numbers and find better-quality or higher-paying work elsewhere.\n\nWorkers have the ability to negotiate whatever they choose to negotiate. AnnElizabeth Konkel economist at Indeed\n\nDespite cooling in recent months, the trend known as the Great Resignation or the Great Reshuffle remains in full swing, according to labor economists. Though surveys suggest some workers later regretted their decision if their new gig didn't live up to expectations, for example. The July jobs report issued last week beat expectations and the U.S. unemployment rate has fallen back to its pre-pandemic level, which had been the lowest since 1969. \"Demand for workers is still going strong, so workers have the ability to negotiate whatever they choose to negotiate,\" Konkel said. \"Maybe that's a signing bonus, maybe that's asking for a higher hourly wage, maybe that's flexibility, maybe that's a particular benefit.\"\n\nNegotiating a signing bonus: 'Make them love you'\n\nLjubaphoto | E+ | Getty Images\n\nThere are a few ways workers can think about negotiating a signing bonus \u2014 or a better offer if one is already on the table. First, think about the money you may be leaving on the table at your current employer, according to Mandi Woodruff-Santos, a career and money coach. She has estimated that negotiating signing bonuses added $160,000 to her income over a 10-year period. That category might include unvested 401(k) match funds or stock options \u2014 money that isn't yet yours but would be if you stayed at your current job. It may also include tuition reimbursement or a signing bonus your current employer paid, but which you'd have to pay back if you don't meet certain contractual obligations such as employment duration. Add this all up, and you can use this sum to negotiate for a signing bonus of that amount with a prospective employer, said Woodruff-Santos, who founded MandiMoney Makers, a group coaching community for women of color.",

                "text": "Passengers at an American Airlines gate at the Dallas/Fort Worth International airport in Dallas. Scott Mlyn | CNBC\n\nIt wasn't long ago that Amazon, Shopify and Peloton doubled their workforces to manage through the pandemic surge, while Morgan Stanley staffed up to handle a record level of IPOs, and mortgage lenders added headcount as rock-bottom rates led to a refinancing boom. On the flipside, Delta Air Lines, Hilton Worldwide and legions of restaurants slashed headcount because of lockdowns that rolled through much of the country and other parts of the world. Now, they're scrambling to reverse course. Companies that hired like crazy in 2020 and 2021 to meet customer demand are being forced to make sweeping cuts or impose hiring freezes with a possible recession on the horizon. In a matter of months, CEOs have gone from hypergrowth mode to concerns over \"macroeconomic uncertainty,\" a phrase investors have heard many times on second-quarter earnings calls. Stock trading app Robinhood and crypto exchange Coinbase both recently slashed more than 1,000 jobs after their splashy market debuts in 2021. Meanwhile, airlines, hotels and eateries face the opposite problem as their businesses continue to pick up following the era of Covid-induced shutdowns. After instituting mass layoffs early in the pandemic, they can't hire quickly enough to satisfy demand and are dealing with a labor market radically different from the one they experienced over two years ago, before the cutbacks. \"The pandemic created very unique, once-in-a-lifetime conditions in many different industries that caused a dramatic reallocation of capital,\" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at job recruiting site ZipRecruiter. \"Many of those conditions no longer apply so you're seeing a reallocation of capital back to more normal patterns.\"\n\nFor employers, those patterns are particularly challenging to navigate, because inflation levels have jumped to a 40-year high, and the Fed has lifted its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point on consecutive occasions for the first time since the early 1990s. The central bank's efforts to tamp down inflation have raised concerns that the U.S. economy is headed for recession. Gross domestic product has fallen for two straight quarters, hitting a widely accepted rule of thumb for recession, though the National Bureau of Economic Research hasn't yet made that declaration. The downward trend was bound to happen eventually, and market experts lamented the frothiness in stock prices and absurdity of valuations as late as the fourth quarter of last year, when the major indexes hit record highs led by the riskiest assets. That was never more evident than in November, when electric vehicle maker Rivian went public on almost no revenue and quickly reached a market cap of over $150 billion. Bitcoin hit a record the same day, touching close to $69,000. Since then, bitcoin is off by two-thirds, and Rivian has lost about 80% of its value. In July, the car company started layoffs of about 6% of its workforce. Rivian's headcount almost quintupled to around 14,000 between late 2020 and mid-2022.\n\nTech layoffs and an air of caution\n\nJob cuts and hiring slowdowns were big talking points on tech earnings calls last week. Amazon reduced its headcount by 99,000 people to 1.52 million employees at the end of the second quarter after almost doubling in size during the pandemic, when it needed to beef up its warehouse capabilities. Shopify, whose cloud technology helps retailers build and manage online stores, cut about 1,000 workers, or around 10% of its global workforce. The company doubled its headcount over a two-year period starting at the beginning of 2020, as the business boomed from the number or stores and restaurants that had to suddenly go digital. Shopify CEO Tobias Lutke said in a memo to employees that the company had wagered that the pandemic surge would cause the transition from physical retail to ecommerce to \"permanently leap ahead by 5 or even 10 years.\" \"It's now clear that bet didn't pay off,\" Lutke wrote, adding that the picture was starting to look more like it did before Covid. \"Ultimately, placing this bet was my call to make and I got this wrong. Now, we have to adjust.\" After Facebook parent Meta missed on its results and forecast a second straight quarter of declining revenue, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will be reducing job growth over the next year. Headcount expanded by about 60% during the pandemic. \"This is a period that demands more intensity and I expect us to get more done with fewer resources,\" Zuckerberg said. Google parent Alphabet, which grew its workforce by over 30% during the two Covid years, recently told employees that they needed to focus and improve productivity. The company asked for suggestions on how to be more efficient at work.\n\n\"It's clear we are facing a challenging macro environment with more uncertainty ahead,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said in a meeting with employees. \"We should think about how we can minimize distractions and really raise the bar on both product excellence and productivity.\" Few U.S. companies have been hit as hard as Peloton, whose fitness equipment and on-demand classes became an instant gym replacement during lockdowns and which has since suffered from massive oversupply issues and out-of-control costs. After doubling headcount in the 12 months ended June 30, 2021, the company in February announced plans to cut 20% of corporate positions as it named a new CEO.\n\nBanks and Wall Street bracing for a 'hurricane'\n\nSome of the Peloton products that were flying off the shelves in the pandemic were being offered as perks for overworked junior bankers, who were sorely needed to help manage a boom in IPOs, mergers and stock issuance. Activity picked up with such ferocity that junior bankers were complaining about 100-hour workweeks, and banks started scouting for talent in unusual places like consulting and accounting firms. That helps explain why the six biggest U.S. banks added a combined 59,757 employees from the start of 2020 through the middle of 2022, the equivalent of the industry picking up the full population of a Morgan Stanley or a Goldman Sachs in a little over two years. It wasn't just investment banking. The government unleashed trillions of dollars in stimulus payments and small business loans designed to keep the economy moving amid the widespread shutdowns. A feared wave of loan defaults never arrived, and banks instead took in an unprecedented flood of deposits. Their Main Street lending operations had better repayment rates than before the pandemic. Among top banks, Morgan Stanley saw the biggest jump in headcount, with its employee levels expanding 29% to 78,386 from early 2020 to the middle of this year. The growth was fueled in part by CEO James Gorman\u2019s acquisitions of money management firms E-Trade and Eaton Vance. At rival investment bank Goldman Sachs, staffing levels jumped 22% to 47,000 in the same time frame, as CEO David Solomon broke into consumer finance and bolstered wealth management operations, including through the acquisition of fintech lender GreenSky. Citigroup saw a 15% boost in headcount during the pandemic, while JPMorgan Chase added 8.5% to its workforce, becoming the industry's largest employer. But the good times on Wall Street didn\u2019t last. The stock market had its worst first half in 50 years, and IPOs dried up. Investment banking revenue at the major players declined sharply in the second quarter. Goldman Sachs responded by slowing hiring and is considering a return to year-end job reductions, according to a person with knowledge of the bank\u2019s plans. Employees typically make up the single biggest line item when it comes to expenses in banking, so when markets crater, layoffs are usually on the horizon. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in June that an economic \"hurricane\" was on its way, and said the bank was bracing itself for volatile markets.\n\nJamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., during a Bloomberg Television interview in London, U.K., on Wednesday, May 4, 2022. Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nZipRecruiter's Pollak said one area in finance where there will likely be a hemorrhaging of workers is in mortgage lending. She said 60% more people went into real estate in 2020 and 2021 because of record low mortgage rates and rising home prices. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo have reportedly trimmed hundreds of mortgage staffers as volumes collapsed. \"Nobody is refinancing anymore, and sales are slowing,\" Pollak said. \"You're going to have to see employment levels and hiring slow down. That growth was all about that moment.\" The intersection of Silicon Valley and Wall Street is a particularly gloomy place at the moment as rising rates and crumbling stock multiples converge. Crypto trading platform Coinbase in June announced plans to lay off 18% of its workforce in preparation for a \"crypto winter\" and even rescinded job offers to people it had hired. Headcount tripled in 2021 to 3,730 employees. Stock trading app Robinhood said Tuesday it's cutting about 23% of its workforce, a little over three months after eliminating 9% of its full-time staff, which had ballooned from 2,100 to 3,800 in the last nine months of 2021. \"We are at the tail end of that pandemic-era distortion,\" said Aaron Terrazas, chief economist at job search and review site Glassdoor. \"Obviously, it's not going away, but it is changing to a more normalized period, and companies are adapting to this new reality.\"\n\nRetail is whipsawing back and forth\n\nNurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThey hardly could have predicted how quickly the dynamic would shift, as rapid and soaring inflation forced Americans to tighten their belts. Retailers have already started to warn of waning demand, leaving them with bloated inventories. Gap said higher promotions will hurt gross margins in its fiscal second quarter. Kohl's cut its guidance for the second quarter, citing softened consumer spending. Walmart last week slashed its profit forecast and said surging prices for food and gas are squeezing consumers. That pain is filtering into the ad market. Online bulletin board Pinterest on Monday cited \"lower than expected demand from U.S. big box retailers and mid-market advertisers\" as one reason why it missed Wall Street estimates for second-quarter earnings and revenue. Retail giants have so far avoided big layoff announcements, but smaller players are in cut mode. Stitch Fix, 7-Eleven and Game Stop have said they'll be eliminating jobs, and outdoor grill maker Weber warned it's considering layoffs as sales slow.\n\nThe travel industry can't hire fast enough\n\nWith all of the downsizing taking place across wide swaths of the U.S. economy, the applicant pool should be wide open for airlines, restaurants and hospitality companies, which are trying to repopulate their ranks after undergoing mass layoffs when Covid hit. It's not so easy. Even though Amazon has reduced headcount of late, it's still got far more people working in its warehouses than it did two years ago. Last year the company lifted average starting pay to $18 an hour, a level that's difficult to meet for much of the services industry. Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta said on the quarterly earnings call in May that he wasn't satisfied with customer service and that the company needs more workers. At the end of last year, even as travel was rebounding sharply, headcount at Hilton's managed, owned and leased properties as well as corporate locations was down by over 30,000 from two years earlier. It's easy to see why customer service is a challenge. According to a report last week from McKinsey on summer 2022 travel trends, revenue per available room in the U.S. \"is outstripping not just 2020 and 2021 levels, but increasingly 2019 levels too.\"\n\nDelta Airlines passenger jets are pictured outside the newly completed 1.3 million-square foot $4 billion Delta Airlines Terminal C at LaGuardia Airport in New York, June 1, 2022.

But it is hard for businesses to know which.\n\n\u201cI think businesses are correct that the current state of the economy can\u2019t really hold \u2014 something has to give,\u201d Mr. Ozimek said.\n\nTo most people, of course, this doesn\u2019t feel like a boom. Measures of consumer confidence are at record lows, and Americans overwhelmingly say they are dissatisfied with the economy. That perception is grounded in reality: High inflation is eroding \u2014 and in some cases erasing \u2014 the benefits of a strong job market for many workers. Hourly earnings, adjusted for inflation, are falling at their fastest pace in decades.\n\n\u201cI know people will hear today\u2019s extraordinary jobs report and say they don\u2019t see it, they don\u2019t feel it in their own lives,\u201d President Biden said Friday. \u201cI know how hard it is. I know it\u2019s hard to feel good about job creation when you already have a job and you\u2019re dealing with rising prices \u2014 food and gas and so much more. I get it.\u201d\n\nTara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University, said the United States wasn\u2019t experiencing a true boom. That would imply a virtuous circle, in which prosperity begets investment, which begets more prosperity and makes the economy more productive in the long term \u2014 a rising tide that lifts all boats.\n\nInstead, the lingering disruptions of the pandemic, uncertainty over what the post-Covid economy will look like and fears of a recession have made businesses reluctant to make bets on the future. Business investment fell in the most recent quarter. Employers are hiring, but they are leaning heavily on one-time bonuses rather than permanent pay increases.",

                "text": "St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Wednesday that the central bank will continue raising rates until it sees compelling evidence that inflation is falling.\n\nThe central bank official said he expects another 1.5 percentage points or so in interest rate increases this year as the Fed continues to battle the highest inflation levels since the early 1980s.\n\n\"I think we'll probably have to be higher for longer in order to get the evidence that we need to see that inflation is actually turning around on all dimensions and in a convincing way coming lower, not just a tick lower here and there,\" Bullard said during a live \"Squawk Box\" interview on CNBC.\n\nThat message of continued rate hikes is consistent with other Fed speakers this week, including regional presidents Loretta Mester of Cleveland, Charles Evans of Chicago and Mary Daly of San Francisco. Each said Tuesday that the inflation fight is far from over and more monetary policy tightening will be needed.\n\nBoth Bullard and Mester are voting members this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. The group last week approved a second consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase to the Fed's benchmark borrowing rate.\n\nIf Bullard has his way, the rate will continue rising to a range of 3.75%-4% by the end of the year. After starting 2022 near zero, the rate has now come up to a range of 2.25%-2.5%.\n\nConsumer price inflation is running at a 12-month rate of 9.1%, its highest since November 1981. Even throwing out the highs and lows of inflation, as the Dallas Fed does with its \"trimmed mean\" estimate, inflation is running at 4.3%.\n\n\"We're going to have to see convincing evidence across the board, headline and other measures of core inflation, all coming down convincingly before we'll be able to feel like we're doing our job,\" Bullard said.\n\nThe rate hikes come at a time of slowing growth in the U.S., which has seen consecutive quarters of negative GDP readings, a common definition of recession. However, Bullard said he doesn't think the economy is really in recession.\n\n\"We're not in a recession right now. We do have these two quarters of negative GDP growth. To some extent, a recession is in the eyes of the beholder,\" he said. \"With all the job growth in the first half of the year, it's hard to say there's a recession. With a flat unemployment rate at 3.6%, it's hard to say there's a recession.\"\n\nThe second half of the year should see reasonably strong growth, though job gains probably will slow to their longer-run trend, he added. July's nonfarm payroll growth is expected to be 258,000, according to Dow Jones estimates.\n\nEven with the slowing trend, markets are pricing in another half percentage point rate hike from the Fed in September, though the chances of a third consecutive 0.75 percentage point move are rising. The market then expects future increases in November and December, taking the benchmark fed funds rate to a range of 3.25%-3.5% by the end of the year, below Bullard's target.\n\n\"We're going to follow the data very carefully, and I think we'll get it right,\" Bullard said.",

But he noted that, \"I'd like to see a period of sustained inflation under control, and until we do that I think we're just going to have to continue to move rates into restrictive territory.\"\n\nHeadline consumer prices were flat in July while producer prices declined 0.5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nHowever, that was just one-month's data: CPI still was up 8.5% on a year-over-year basis, and the producer price index climbed 9.8%. Both numbers are still far above the Fed's 2% long-run inflation objective, so Barkin said the central bank needs to keep pushing forward until it achieves its goal.\n\n\"You'd like to see inflation running at our target, which is 2% at the PCE, and I'd like to see it running at our target for a period of time,\" he said. The Fed uses as its preferred gauge the personal consumption expenditures price index; June headline PCE ran at a 6.8% annual rate while core excluding food and energy was at 4.8%.\n\nBarkin's comments reflect those of most Fed officials who have spoken recently about rates.\n\nThe central bank has hiked its benchmark borrowing rate 0.75 percentage point at each of its last two meetings. Markets are divided over whether the Fed will increase by three-quarters of a point in September or scale down to half a point, with traders tilting slightly toward the latter, according to CME Group data Friday morning.\n\nWhichever is the case, Barkin said acting aggressively now is important. He said his constituents are deeply concerned about inflation and want action from the Fed.\n\n\"Consumers really dislike inflation, and one message that I get loud and clear as I wander around my district is, 'we don't like inflation,'\" he said.",

It is less efficient than simply eliminating deductions or raising the corporate tax rate and could open the door for companies to find new ways to make their income appear lower to reduce their tax bills.\n\nSimilar versions of the idea have been floated by Mr. Biden during his presidential campaign and by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts. They have been promoted as a way to restore fairness to a tax system that has allowed major corporations to dramatically lower their tax bills through deductions and other accounting measures.\n\nAccording to an early estimate from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, the tax would most likely apply to about 150 companies annually, and the bulk of them would be manufacturers. That spurred an outcry from manufacturing companies and Republicans, who have been opposed to any policies that scale back the tax cuts that they enacted five years ago.\n\nAlthough many Democrats acknowledge that the corporate minimum tax was not their first choice of tax hikes, they have embraced it as a political winner. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, shared Joint Committee on Taxation data on Thursday indicating that in 2019, about 100 to 125 corporations reported financial statement income greater than $1 billion, yet their effective tax rates were lower than 5 percent. The average income reported on financial statements to shareholders was nearly $9 billion, but they paid an average effective tax rate of just 1.1 percent.\n\n\u201cCompanies are paying rock-bottom rates while reporting record profits to their shareholders,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.",

                "text": "Mary Daly, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, poses after giving a speech on the U.S. economic outlook, in Idaho Falls, Idaho, U.S., November 12 2018.\n\nThe Federal Reserve still has a lot of work to do before it gets inflation under control, and that means higher interest rates, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Tuesday.\n\n\"People are still struggling with the higher prices they're paying and the rising prices,\" Daly said during a live LinkedIn interview with CNBC's Jon Fortt. \"The number of people who can't afford this week what they paid for with ease six months ago just means our work is far from done.\"\n\nSeparately, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans opened up the possibility of another large rate hike ahead, but said he hopes that can be avoided, with the Fed being able to bring down inflation without having to use harsh policy tightening.\n\nSo far this year, the central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate four times, totaling 2.25 percentage points. That has come in response to inflation running at a 9.1% annual rate, the highest level since November 1981.\n\nThe Fed in July raised its funds rate 0.75 percentage point, the same as it hiked in June. Those were the largest back-to-back increases since the central bank started using the funds rate as its chief monetary policy tool in the early 1990s.\n\nBut Daly cautioned that no one should take those big moves as an indication that the Fed is winding down its rate hikes.\n\n\"Nowhere near almost done,\" she said in assessing the progress. \"We have made a good start and I feel really pleased with where we've gotten to at this point.\"\n\nFutures pricing indicates the markets see the Fed raising rates by 0.5 percentage point in September and another half percentage point through the end of the year, taking the funds rate to a range of 3.25%-3.5%, according to CME Group data. That scenario holds that the economy would slow due to the policy tightening, and the Fed would start cutting rates by next summer.\n\nBut Daly pushed back on that notion.\n\n\"That's a puzzle to me,\" she said. \"I don't know where they find that in the data. To me, that would not be my modal outlook.\"\n\nEvans, her Fed colleague, also spoke Tuesday morning, saying the central bank is likely to keep its foot on the brake until it sees inflation coming down. He expects policymakers to raise rates by half a percentage point at their next meeting in September, but left the door open to a bigger move.\n\n\"Fifty [basis points] is a reasonable assessment, but 75 could also be OK,\" he told reporters. \"I doubt that more would be called for.\" A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.\n\n\"We wanted to get to neutral expeditiously. We want to get a little restrictive expeditiously,\" Evans added. \"We want to see if the real side effects are going to start coming back in line ... or if we have a lot more ahead of us.\"\n\nHowever, he also said he's hopeful that policymakers could soon pause the rate hikes as inflation comes down.\n\nNeither Evans nor Daly are voting members this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, though they do participate in policy sessions.\n\nThe FOMC does not meet in August, when it will hold its annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Its next two-day meeting is next month, Sept. 20-21.",

Homebuyers are facing a worsening affordability situation with mortgage rates hovering around the highest levels in more than a decade.\n\nMortgage balances rose 1.9% for the quarter, or $207 billion, to about $11.4 trillion, even though the pace of originations moved lower. That annual increase marked a 9.1% gain from a year ago as home prices exploded during the pandemic era.\n\n\"Americans are borrowing more, but a big part of the increased borrowing is attributable to higher prices,\" the New York Fed said in a blog post accompanying the release.\n\nThe collective American IOU totaled $16.15 trillion through the end of June, good for a $312 billion \u2014 or 2% \u2014 increase from the previous quarter. Debt gains were widespread but particularly focused on mortgages and vehicle purchases.\n\nHousehold debt climbed past $16 trillion in the second quarter for the first time, as soaring inflation pushed up housing and auto balances, the New York Federal Reserve reported Tuesday.\n\nCredit card balances surged $46 billion in the three-month period and 13% over the past year, which Fed researchers said was the largest gain in more than 20 years. Non-housing credit balances increased 2.4% from the first quarter, the biggest gain since 2016.\n\nStudent loan debt was little changed at $1.59 trillion.\n\nThe increase in borrowing comes with inflation running at an 8.6% annual rate in the second quarter that included a 9.1% increase in June \u2014 the biggest move since November 1981 \u2014 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Shelter inflation rose at a 5.5% annual rate in June and new and used vehicle prices were up 11.4% and 7.1% respectively.\n\nIn response to the elevated inflation levels, the Fed has raised interest rates four times in 2022, with the increases totaling 2.25 percentage points. Those moves in turn have pushed up 30-year mortgage rates to 5.41%, up more than 2 percentage points from the beginning of the year, according to Freddie Mac.\n\nDespite the rising debt and inflation levels and higher interest rates, delinquency rates remained relatively benign.\n\n\"Although debt balances are growing rapidly, households in general have weathered the pandemic remarkably well, due in no small part to the expansive programs put in place to support them,\" the Fed blog post said. \"Further, household debt is held overwhelmingly by higher-score borrowers, even more so now than it has been in the history of our data.\"\n\nThrough June, some 2.7% of outstanding debt was in delinquency, nearly 2 percentage points lower than the first quarter of 2020 as the nation was entering the Covid pandemic.\n\nFed economists noted that delinquency rates were nudging higher for subprime borrowers at the lower end of the credit scale.",

                "text": "The Federal Reserve is unlikely to pivot from its hawkish interest rate hikes despite positive signs this week that inflation in the U.S. could be easing, according to market strategists. On Thursday, the producer price index surprisingly fell 0.5% in July from the prior month, compared with an estimate of a 0.2% gain, according to a Dow Jones survey. On an annual basis, the index rose 9.8%, the lowest rate since October 2021. That followed encouraging data that showed consumer prices rose 8.5% in July. The rate was slightly cooler than the 8.7% expected by analysts surveyed by Dow Jones and a slowing pace from the prior month. As both CPI and PPI soften, markets have started to moderate their expectations for Fed rate hikes. Still, the positive data doesn't mean it is \"mission complete\" for the Fed, said Ben Emons, managing director of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors. \"If you strip off any of the headline noise, some of the\u2026 CPI, even PPI [numbers] show still upward pressures,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Friday. \"The Fed cannot be done here. It probably means that the 75-basis-point rate hike remains on the table.\" \"The pricing on the Fed fund futures and euro-dollar futures shows that we're still more towards the 75-basis-point rate hike. And I think it is because of the guidance that all these Fed speakers keep giving us \u2014 'just don't be complacent here, we're going to continue,'\" Emons added.\n\nLast week, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the central bank will continue raising rates until it sees compelling evidence that inflation is falling. That message is consistent with other Fed speakers, including regional presidents Loretta Mester of Cleveland, Charles Evans of Chicago and Mary Daly of San Francisco. All of them have indicated recently that the inflation fight is far from over and more monetary policy tightening will be needed.\n\n'Not enough evidence'\n\nThe Fed raised its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point in both June and July \u2014 the largest back-to-back increases since the central bank started using the funds rate as its chief monetary policy tool in the early 1990s. Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments, said the Fed is nowhere near putting the brakes and turning dovish on rate hikes, given the current data. \"For me, there's not enough evidence for the Fed to make a huge pivot from where they are. I still think they're considering 50, 75 basis points at the September meeting,\" she told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia\" on Friday. \"Not anything coming out of the economic reports from CPI or the PPI in today's session is going to change that at this point in time. I think we still have a considerable ways to go,\" she added. Investors will be looking for guidance from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on what the Fed could do at its next meeting in September.\n\nInflation still sticky\n\nFernandez underlined the stickier parts of inflation, such as wage and rent pressures, are still high. Those are not coming down at the same rate as energy, oil and gasoline components, she said.",

Lucas Schifres | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 China's tourist-heavy province of Hainan is falling further behind lofty growth goals it set in January. Back then, the island said it aimed for 9% GDP growth this year. But like China's economy overall, growth is running far below initial targets \u2014 due in a large part to outbreaks of a far more transmissible Covid variant. A surge in Covid infections this month forced Hainan's oceanside resort city of Sanya to order tens of thousands of tourists to stay put at their hotels, and local residents to stay at home. Haikou, the province's capital, also issued stay-home orders. Airlines cancelled flights, leaving tourists stranded on Hainan island since Saturday. In the last few days, some people have been able to return to the mainland on government-organized charter flights. But questions remain \u2014 about uniform implementation of hotel stay subsidies, the cost of food and how soon most tourists can return to their homes.\n\n\"The public image and reputation of Hainan is damaged for the short term,\" said Jacques Penhirin, a partner in the Greater China office of Oliver Wyman. \"When I talk to the client they're all looking at the bookings for [the upcoming fall holiday] which are still quite resilient. People have not cancelled yet, but it's not looking good. Probably down on last year.\" It's \"going to be bad for luxury brands and hospitality at least until Chinese New Year next year,\" he said, referring to the Lunar New Year holiday in late January 2023.\n\nHainan's economy\n\nIn late July, China's top leaders indicated the country might miss the GDP target of around 5.5% set in March. Beijing did not signal any large-scale stimulus, or any change to its \"dynamic zero-Covid\" policy. The national economy grew by just 2.5% in the first half of the year, according to official figures. Hainan's economy underperformed even that sluggish pace, only growing by 1.6% in the first half of 2022. That's a sharp slowdown from the island's 11.2% GDP growth for all of 2021. In fact, Hainan's growth last year was second only to that of Hubei province, pointed out Ying Zhang, research analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nRead more about China from CNBC Pro JPMorgan says buy this undervalued Chinese biopharma stock that can rally more than 40% from here\n\n\"Because of the international travel restriction, Hainan has benefited from the tourism revenue, up by nearly 60% last year,\" she said. Zhang estimates tourism accounts for more than 80% of Hainan's economy. Sanya, on the southern coast of Hainan, was the top destination for couples flying from three of China's largest cities last week for China's version of Valentine's Day, according to booking site Trip.com. The island boasts one of the few beachfront locations for international luxury hotels like Mandarin Oriental and Hyatt in mainland China. Hainan is also building out duty-free shopping malls as part of central government's push to turn the island into a free trade hub and international shopping area. Sales at duty-free stores on the island surged by 84% last year to 60.17 billion yuan ($8.93 billion), according to official figures. During a consumer goods expo in Hainan in late July, sales at four duty-free stores rose by 27% year-on-year to 330 million yuan, the customs agency said.\n\nAnother hit to confidence\n\nSo far, cosmetics brands rely far more on Hainan for sales than affordable luxury brands \u2014 potentially up to a third of their China business, said Oliver Wyman's Penhirin. He said Hainan generally accounts for less than 5% of China sales for affordable luxury brands, while high-end luxury has yet to enter that market. An Oliver Wyman survey in May found that after roughly two months of lockdown in the metropolis of Shanghai, respondents from luxury and premium consumer brands cut their China growth expectations for the year by 15 percentage points.\n\nTens of thousands of tourists were stranded in the resort city of Sanya, Hainan, this week as local Covid outbreaks prompted airlines to cancel flights.

                "text": "A sign is posted in front of a home for sale on July 14, 2022 in San Francisco, California. The number of homes for sale in the U.S. increased by 2 percent in June for the first time since 2019.\n\nPrice gains are still strong because of an imbalance between supply and demand. The housing market has had a severe shortage for years. Strong demand during the coronavirus pandemic exacerbated it.\n\nHome prices are still higher than they were a year ago, but the gains slowed at the fastest pace on record in June, according to Black Knight, a mortgage software, data and analytics firm that began tracking this metric in the early 1970s. The annual rate of price appreciation fell two percentage points from 19.3% to 17.3%.\n\nRising mortgage rates and inflation in the wider economy caused housing demand to drop sharply in June, forcing home prices to cool down.\n\nEven when home prices crashed dramatically during the recession of 2007-09, the strongest single-month slowdown was 1.19 percentage points. Prices are not expected to fall nationally, given a stronger overall housing market, but higher mortgage rates are certainly taking their toll.\n\nThe average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage crossed above 6% in June, according to Mortgage News Daily. It has since dropped back into the lower 5% range, but that is still significantly higher than the 3% range rates were in at the start of this year.\n\n\"The slowdown was broad-based among the top 50 markets at the metro level, with some areas experiencing even more pronounced cooling,\" said Ben Graboske, president of Black Knight Data & Analytics. \"In fact, 25% of major U.S. markets saw growth slow by three percentage points in June, with four decelerating by four or more points in that month alone.\"\n\nStill, while this was the sharpest cooling on record nationally, the market would have to see six more months of this kind of deceleration for price growth to return to long-run averages, according to Graboske. He calculates that it takes about five months for interest rate impacts to be fully reflected in home prices.\n\nMarkets seeing the sharpest drops are those that previously had the highest prices in the nation. Average home values in San Jose, California, have fallen 5.1% in the last two months, the biggest drop of any of the top markets. That chopped $75,000 off the price.\n\nIn Seattle, prices are down 3.8% in the past two months, or a $30,000 reduction. San Francisco, San Diego and Denver round out the top five markets with the biggest price reductions.\n\nThe cooling in prices coincides with a sharp jump in the supply of homes for sale, up 22% over the last two months, according to Black Knight. Inventory is still, however, 54% lower than 2017-19 levels.\n\n\"With a national shortage of more than 700,000 listings, it would take more than a year of such record increases for inventory levels to fully normalize,\" said Graboske.\n\nPrice drops will not affect the average homeowner as much as they did during the Great Recession, because homeowners today have considerably more equity. Tight underwriting and several years of strong price appreciation caused home equity levels to hit record highs.\n\nDespite that, the strong demand in the market recently could present a problem for some. About 10% of mortgaged properties were purchased in the last year, so price drops could cause some borrowers to edge much lower in their equity positions.",

The firm found three that are most vulnerable to real estate's troubles:\n\n1.

                "text": "If you're debating whether or not the U.S. is in a recession, you're asking the wrong question, according to a top Federal Reserve official.\n\n\"Whether we are technically in a recession or not doesn't change my analysis,\" Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday. \"I'm focused on the inflation data. I'm focused on the wage data. And so far, inflation continues to surprise us to the upside. Wages continue to grow.\"\n\nLast month, U.S. inflation jumped to a four-decade record high, rising 9.1% from a year ago. At the same time, the labor market remained strong: Nonfarm payrolls increased by 372,000 last month, alongside a low national unemployment rate of 3.6%.\n\nOn Thursday, new Labor Department data showed signs of a job market cooldown, with initial jobless claims hitting their highest level since mid-November. Still, Kashkari said, the labor market is \"very, very strong.\"\n\n\"Typically, recessions demonstrate high job losses, high unemployment, those are terrible for American families. And we're not seeing anything like that,\" he said.\n\nThe problem, Kashkari said, is that even in a strong job market, inflation is outpacing wage growth \u2014 giving many Americans a functional \"wage cut\" as living costs increase nationwide. Solving that problem by reducing inflation is the Federal Reserve's top goal right now, he added.\n\n\"Whether we are technically in a recession or not doesn't change the fact that the Federal Reserve has its own work to do, and we are committed to doing it,\" Kashkari said.\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Thursday that the country's gross domestic product shrunk for the second straight quarter, often a warning sign accompanying economic recessions. For Kashkari, that may actually be a good thing: An economic slowdown could help reduce inflation to the point where it no longer outpaces wage growth.\n\n\"We definitely want to see some slowing [of economic growth],\" he said. \"We don't want to see the economy overheating. We would love it if we could transition to a sustainable economy without tipping the economy into recession.\"\n\nDoing so poses a significant challenge for the Fed. Kashkari acknowledged that economic slowdowns tend to be very difficult to control, \"especially if it's the central bank that's inducing the slowdown.\"\n\nStill, he said, the bank will do whatever is necessary to tame inflation.\n\n\"We're going to do everything we can to avoid a recession, but we are committed to bringing inflation down, and we are going to do what we need to do,\" Kashkari said. \"We are a long way away from achieving an economy that is back at 2% inflation. And that's where we need to get to.\"",

Poshmark topped revenue estimates but gave a weak revenue outlook for the current quarter.\n\nIllumina \u2014 Illumina slumped nearly 23% post-market after the company missed top- and bottom-line estimates in the most recent quarter and issued disappointing guidance for the full year as it faces a troublesome macro environment.\n\nOlo \u2014 Olo tumbled more than 21% in extended trading after the restaurant software company provided weak guidance for the current quarter and the full year.

                "text": "An inflation gauge that the Federal Reserve uses as its primary barometer jumped to its highest 12-month gain in more than 40 years in June, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Friday.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index rose 6.8%, the biggest 12-month move since the 6.9% increase in January 1982. The index rose 1% from May, tying its biggest monthly gain since February 1981.\n\nExcluding food and energy, so-called core PCE increased 4.8% from a year ago, up one-tenth of a percentage point from May but off the recent high of 5.3% hit in February. On a monthly basis, core was up 0.6%, its biggest monthly gain since April 2021.\n\nBoth core readings were 0.1 percentage point above the Dow Jones estimates.\n\nFed officials generally focus on core inflation, but have turned their attention recently to the headline numbers as well, as food and fuel prices have soared in 2022.\n\nThe BEA release also showed that personal consumption expenditures, a gauge of consumer spending, increased 1.1% for the month, above the 0.9% estimate and owing largely to the surge in prices. Real spending adjusted for inflation increased just 0.1% as consumers barely kept up with inflation. Personal income rose 0.6%, topping the 0.5% estimate, but disposable income adjusted for inflation fell 0.3%.\n\nEarlier this month, data showed the consumer price index rose 9.1% from a year ago, the biggest gain since November 1981. The Fed prefers PCE over CPI as a broader measure of inflation pressures. CPI indicates the change in the out-of-pocket expenditures of urban households, while the PCE index measures the price change in goods and services consumed by all households, as well as nonprofit institutions serving households.\n\nThere was other bad inflation news Thursday.\n\nThe employment cost index, another figure Fed policymakers follow closely, rose 1.3% in the second quarter. That represented a slight decline from the 1.4% gain in the previous quarter, but was ahead of the 1.1% estimate. Further, the 5.1% increase on a 12-month basis marked a record for a data series that goes back to the first quarter of 2002.\n\n\"The rest of the economy might be slowing down, but wages are speeding up,\" said Nick Bunker, economic research director at job placement site Indeed. \"Competition for workers remains fierce as employers have to keep bidding up wages for new hires. These red-hot wage growth statistics may fade in the near term, but there's a long way for them to drop.\"\n\nThe Fed has been using a recipe of rate increases and a reduction in asset holdings to bring down prices that have soared to their highest levels since the Reagan administration and have helped cool consumer spending.\n\nPrivate sector wage gains of 1.6% for the quarter are \"seriously disappointing\" for the Fed, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nThe Fed follows the ECI figures because they adjust for compositional effects, or imbalances between gains from higher- and lower-wage workers, as well as other factors.\n\n\"Wage gains at this pace are far too high for the Fed, because they would require implausible rapid productivity growth in order to be consistent with the inflation target in the medium-term,\" Shepherdson wrote.\n\nFed officials earlier this week approved a second consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase in the central bank's benchmark interest rate. Inflation by any measure has been running well above the Fed's 2% longer-run target, and Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is \"strongly committed\" to bringing inflation down.\n\nIn normal times, the Fed focuses on inflation excluding food and energy costs because they are so volatile and don't always reflect longer-run trends. But Powell acknowledged Wednesday that policymakers need to be attentive to both types of inflation in the current environment.\n\n\"Core inflation is a better predictor of inflation going forward, headline inflation tends to be volatile. So, in ordinary times, you look through volatile moves in commodities,\" he said. \"The problem with the current situation is that if you have a sustained period of supply shocks, those can actually start to undermine or to work on de-anchoring inflation expectations. The public doesn't distinguish between core and headline inflation in their thinking.\"\n\nMarkets expect the Fed to raise rates by another half percentage point in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tracker. However, the probability for a bigger three-quarter-point hike rose Friday morning to 38%.",

                "text": "Eugene Zhang, founding partner of Silicon Valley VC firm TSVC Spencer Greene, general partner of TSVC Courtesy: TSVC\n\nEugene Zhang, a veteran Silicon Valley investor, recalls the exact moment the market for young startups peaked this year. The firehose of money from venture capital firms, hedge funds and wealthy families pouring into seed-stage companies was reaching absurd levels, he said. A company that helps startups raise money had an oversubscribed round at a preposterous $80 million valuation. In another case, a tiny software firm with barely $50,000 in revenue got a $35 million valuation. But that was before the turmoil that hammered publicly traded tech giants in late 2021 began to reach the smallest and most speculative of startups. The red-hot market suddenly cooled, with investors dropping out in the middle of funding rounds, leaving founders high and dry, Zhang said. As the balance of power in the startup world shifts back to those holding the purse strings, the industry has settled on a new math that founders need to accept, according to Zhang and others. \"The first thing you need to do is forget about your classmates at Stanford who raised money at [2021] valuations,\" Zhang says to founders, he told CNBC in a recent Zoom interview. \"We tell them to just forget the past three years happened, go back to 2019 or 2018 before the pandemic,\" he said. That amounts to valuations roughly 40% to 50% off the recent peak, according to Zhang.\n\n'Out of control'\n\nThe painful adjustment rippling through Silicon Valley is a lesson in how much luck and timing can affect the life of a startup \u2014 and the wealth of founders. For more than a decade, larger and larger sums of money have been thrown at companies across the startup spectrum, inflating the value of everything from tiny prerevenue outfits to still-private behemoths like SpaceX. The low interest rate era following the 2008 financial crisis spawned a global search for yield, blurring the lines between various kinds of investors as they all increasingly sought returns in private companies. Growth was rewarded, even if it was unsustainable or came with poor economics, in the hopes that the next Amazon or Tesla would emerge. The situation reached a fever pitch during the pandemic, when \"tourist\" investors from hedge funds, and other newcomers, piled into funding rounds backed by name-brand VCs, leaving little time for due diligence before signing a check. Companies doubled and tripled valuations in months, and unicorns became so common that the phrase became meaningless. More private U.S. companies hit at least $1 billion in valuation last year than in the previous half-decade combined. \"It was kind of out of control in the last three years,\" Zhang said. The beginning of the end of the party came in September, when shares of pandemic winners including PayPal and Block began to plunge as investors anticipated the start of Federal Reserve interest rate increases. Next hit were the valuations of pre-IPO companies, including Instacart and Klarna, which plunged by 38% and 85% respectively, before the doldrums eventually reached down to the early-stage startups.\n\nDeep cuts\n\nHard as they are for founders to accept, valuation haircuts have become standard across the industry, according to Nichole Wischoff, a startup executive turned VC investor. \"Everyone's saying the same thing: `What's normal now is not what you saw the last two or three years,'\" Wischoff said. \"The market is kind of marching together saying, `Expect a 35% to 50% valuation decrease from the last couple of years. That's the new normal, take it or leave it.'\" Beyond the headline-grabbing valuation cuts, founders are also being forced to accept more onerous terms in funding rounds, giving new investors more protections or more aggressively diluting existing shareholders. Not everyone has accepted the new reality, according to Zhang, a former engineer who founded venture firm TSVC in 2010. The outfit made early investments in eight unicorns, including Zoom and Carta. It typically holds onto its stakes until a company IPOs, although it sold some positions in December ahead of the expected downturn. \"Some people don't listen; some people do,\" Zhang said. \"We work with the people who listen, because it doesn't matter if you raised $200 million and later on your company dies; nobody will remember you.\" Along with his partner Spencer Greene, Zhang has seen boom-and-bust cycles since before 2000, a perspective that today's entrepreneurs lack, he said. Founders who have to raise money in coming months need to test existing investors' appetite, stay close to customers and in some cases make deep job cuts, he said. \"You have to take painful measures and be proactive instead of just passively assuming that money will show up someday,\" Zhang said.\n\nA good vintage?",

It comes after a GDP rate of 0.5% in the first quarter.\n\nThe numbers contrast sharply with the negative annualized readings out of the United States for both the first and second quarter, as the euro zone continues to benefit from the reopening of its economy after the pandemic.\n\nHowever, a growing number of economists are expecting the euro zone to slide into a recession next year, with Nomura, for example, forecasting an annual contraction of 1.2% and Berenberg pointing to a 1% slowdown.\n\nEven the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, has admitted that a recession could be on the cards \u2014 and as early as this year if Russia completely cuts off the region's gas supplies.\n\nOfficials in Europe have become increasingly concerned about the possibility of a shutdown of gas supplies, with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen saying Russia is \"blackmailing\" the region. Russia has repeatedly denied it's weaponizing its fossil fuel supplies.\n\nHowever, Gazprom, Russia's majority state-owned energy giant, reduced gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to 20% of full capacity this week.

Six Flags reported earnings of 53 cents per share on revenue of $435 million. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv forecast earnings of $1.01 per share on revenue of $519 million. The theme park operator attributed the miss to weak attendance, or a 22% drop in visitors.\n\nWalt Disney \u2013 Disney shares jumped 4.68% after the company posted better-than-expected results for the quarter on the top and bottom lines, helped by strong attendance at its theme parks and better-than-expected streaming numbers. The company also revealed a new pricing structure for its streaming service that includes an ad-supported tier.\n\nPharma stocks \u2013Shares of Pfizer, GSK and Sanofi slipped 3.32%, 6.71% and 3.94% respectively as investors watched ongoing litigation around Zantac, a recalled heartburn medication. The drug was pulled from shelves in 2020 after the Food and Drug Administration found an impurity in Sanfoli's version that could cause cancer.\n\nRalph Lauren \u2013 Shares of Ralph Lauren climbed 3.77%, continuing a rally that began after the company reported earnings earlier in the week that beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines.\n\nBank stocks \u2013 Shares of Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan gained more than 1% Thursday, outperforming the broader market. The stocks may have been boosted by easing concerns about a recession after a second soft inflation report in a row.\n\nOil stocks \u2013 Oil and energy companies led the S&P 500 on Thursday, supported by a jump in crude futures. Devon Energy jumped 7.34%, notching the best performance in the index midday.\n\nVacasa \u2014Shares of Vacasa jumped 33.22% after the vacation rental services company boosted its full-year outlook, citing a surge in demand. The company also posted a quarterly profit, surprising Wall Street.\n\nWarby Parker \u2013 Shares of Warby Parker surged 19.18% after reporting earnings before the bell. The eyewear retailer, which cut its financial forecast for the year, posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss and sales in-line with analysts' estimates. It also cut 63 jobs.\n\nBumble \u2013 Shares of the dating app dropped 8.61% after the company cut its annual revenue forecast. Bumble posted a negative impact of $9.4 million from foreign currency movements year over year. Meanwhile, its Badoo app and other revenue declined by double digits.\n\nCardinal Health \u2013 Shares of Cardinal Health jumped 5.18% after the company reported mixed quarterly earnings. The pharma company's earnings beat Wall Street estimates, but revenue fell short. The company also announced its CEO Mike Kaufmann would step down Sept. 1 and be replaced by its CFO Jason Hollar.\n\nSonos \u2013Shares of the maker of high-end speakers slid 24.95% after the company missed expectations on the top and bottom lines. Sonos also cut its full-year guidance amid the challenging economic backdrop and announced the upcoming departure of its current chief financial officer.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Samantha Subin, Michelle Fox, Yun Li, Sarah Min and Tanaya Macheel contributed reporting",

                "text": "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Thursday the U.S. economy is in a state of transition, not recession, despite two consecutive quarters of negative growth.\n\nRecession, Yellen insisted, is a \"broad-based weakening of our economy\" that includes substantial layoffs, business closures, strains in household finances and a slowdown in private sector activity.\n\n\"That is not what we are seeing right now,\" she said during an afternoon news conference at the Treasury. \"When you look at the economy, job creation is continuing, household finances remain strong, consumers are spending and businesses are growing.\"\n\nThose comments, though, came on the same day that the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic activity, fell 0.9% in the second quarter.\n\nComing on the heels of a 1.6% contraction in the first quarter, the two straight declines meet a commonly used definition of recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research, however, is the official arbiter of recessions, and likely won't rule for months.\n\nYellen started her remarks with a list of the administration's economic accomplishments, including nonfarm payroll growth of more than 9 million.\n\nBut inflation has proven the bigger obstacle, rising to 9.1% in June while economic growth has failed to keep up. Consumer and business confidence levels have plunged, with recent surveys showing a solid majority of Americans believe the country is in recession.\n\nYellen acknowledged the burden that higher prices carry and said the administration is \"laser-focused\" on addressing the situation.\n\n\"We've entered a new phase in our recovery focused on achieving steady, stable growth without sacrificing the gains of the last 18 months,\" she said. \"We know there are challenges ahead of us. Growth is slowing globally. Inflation remains unacceptably high, and it's this administration's top priority to bring it down.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Yellen both touted the possibilities of a new bill that Democratic lawmakers apparently have agreed on to fight inflation. The legislation is aimed at raising tax revenue, lowering drug costs and investing in renewable energy.\n\nYellen noted that while the Federal Reserve, which she chaired from 2014-18, has \"the primary role in bringing down inflation, the president and I are committed to taking action do drive down costs and protect Americans from the global pressures we face.\"\n\nThe Fed has raised rates four times this year, for a total of 2.25 percentage points, and likely will add more increases later in the year.\n\nYellen attributed rising inflation to the war in Ukraine, supply chain problems and the Covid pandemic. She did not discuss the impact that monetary and fiscal stimulus had on price pressures.",

                "text": "In January 2020, Glenn Youngkin, now the Republican governor of Virginia, got some welcome news. A complex corporate transaction had gone through at the Carlyle Group, the powerful private equity company that Youngkin led as co-chief executive. Under the deal, approved by the Carlyle board and code-named \"Project Phoenix,\" he began receiving $8.5 million worth of Carlyle stock, tax-free, according to court documents.\n\nThe Project Phoenix payout came on top of $54 million in compensation Youngkin had received from Carlyle during the previous two years, regulatory records show. Youngkin retired from Carlyle on Sept. 30, 2020; he won the governor's election in November 2021.\n\nYoungkin was not alone in receiving the 2020 windfall, according to the court documents. Eight other wealthy Carlyle officials received over $200 million worth of company shares in the deal, tax-free and paid for by the company. David M. Rubenstein, Carlyle's billionaire founder and co-chairman, received $70.5 million worth.\n\nNow, that transaction is under attack by a Carlyle shareholder in Delaware Chancery Court. The suit, filed last week by the city of Pittsburgh Comprehensive Municipal Pension Trust Fund, says the $344 million deal harmed Carlyle's stockholders, who received nothing in return when they funded the payday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Carlyle insiders who received the payouts escaped a tax bill that would have exceeded $1 billion, according to the complaint, which accuses Rubenstein, Youngkin and other Carlyle officials of lining their own pockets at the expense of people like police officers and firefighters.\n\n\"The kind of impunity that Carlyle's control group acted with is shocking and unacceptable,\" lawyers for the Pittsburgh pension fund said in their complaint.\n\n\"The beneficiaries of the city of Pittsburgh Comprehensive Municipal Pension Trust Fund are municipal fire and police personnel serving the city of Pittsburgh. Many are first responders putting their lives on the line every day. They depend on the integrity of the financial markets to provide for their retirement.\"\n\nThe Carlyle payout exemplifies the private equity industry's laser focus on avoiding tax bills.\n\nPrivate equity investors already receive special tax treatment on their earnings, under what is known as the carried interest loophole. Much of their income is taxed at 20%, far below the 37% maximum paid by high-earning salaried workers. Initially, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which just passed the Senate, had narrowed the loophole's benefits, but the change disappeared at the insistence of Kyrsten Sinema, the holdout Democratic senator from Arizona, according to news reports.\n\nA Sinema spokeswoman told CNBC that she \"makes every decision based on one criteria: what's best for Arizona.\"\n\nCarlyle's 2020 $344 million tax-free payout to its insiders cited in the lawsuit is a new twist on a type of contract known as a tax receivable agreement, or TRA. Companies and their founders typically create such agreements in conjunction with initial public offerings of the companies' shares.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, TRA payouts can be a win-win for both a company and its insiders, market participants say, because both parties get something of value \u2014 the insiders get stock, and the company gets a tax benefit when they sell it.\n\nBut in a highly unusual move that was unfair to Carlyle's shareholders, lawyers for the Pittsburgh pension fund say, Carlyle structured its payout as tax-free, generating no tax benefits to the company even as it enriched insiders. The tax-free payout was \"an extreme outlier\" among such agreements, and it was designed by the Carlyle insiders \"to maximize the benefits for themselves in every possible way, to the detriment of the company and the public stockholders,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nAsked to respond to the lawsuit's allegations, a spokesperson for Youngkin provided this statement: \"When Mr. Youngkin was a member of Carlyle's leadership, the Carlyle board and an independent special committee retained independent experts and advisors to consider and approve a transaction that had significant benefits for the company and its shareholders. The plaintiff's allegations are baseless and will be vigorously defended against.\"\n\nA Carlyle spokeswoman said in a statement: \"Carlyle was the first U.S. private equity firm to convert to a one share one vote, best-in-class governance model creating better alignment with public shareholders who now have a greater vote and voice.\"\n\nRubenstein, through a spokesman, declined to comment.\n\nLawyers representing the Pittsburgh pension declined to comment further on the suit.\n\nAndy Lee, a New York City-based asset manager who is not involved in the suit, expressed concerns to NBC News about the details it outlined.\n\n\"If the allegations are true, we would discourage such behavior on the part of management,\" said Lee, the chief investment officer of Parallaxes Capital, a financial firm that buys TRAs. \"They are supposed to represent the interests of public shareholders.\"",
