Experts say outdated procedures such as wage garnishment, in which an individual's earnings are withheld for the payment of a debt, are in dire need of a policy update. A survey found that about 7% of workers in America had their wages garnished, according to the most recent study in 2016.\n\n\"For folks who have higher debt loads, they're actually getting their wages garnished or seized at really high rates,\" according to Lucia Mattox, senior policy manager at the Center for Responsible Lending. \"Currently at the federal level, only $217.50 is protected in someone's weekly paycheck and that bill hasn't been updated since the late '60s.\"\n\nThe government can also play a potential role in reducing certain kinds of borrowings, such as medical debt that is currently held by roughly 23 million Americans.\n\n\"There's been a lag in the southeastern states of expanding Medicaid so we know that medical debt is going to be increasing,\" said Mattox. \"But if there's a way to expand Medicaid so that folks are better supported in terms of their medical expenses that's going to be a way to alleviate that burden.\"\n\nWatch the video to find out more about why household debt is rising in America.",

                "text": "The move by President Joe Biden to cancel student debt for millions of Americans has added some wrinkles to the financial businesses that have built up around those loans. The Biden administration announced on Wednesday that up to $10,000 in student debt (or $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients) could be forgiven for borrowers under certain income thresholds. The announcement also said that payments, paused since early 2020, will restart in January. The Department of Education is expected to release more details about the new program in the coming weeks. The exact details will be important to banks, fintech companies and other financial firms that are exposed to the student loan business. Here's an overview of some of the key areas of the market and how the changes could impact the companies and their investors. The refinancing business Because private and refinanced loans are not expected to be subject to forgiveness, and the restart of monthly payments could be a catalyst for many borrowers to explore restructuring their loans, Biden's announcement could be a boon for refinancing businesses. Many fintech companies offer student loan refinancing options. One early winner of the new policy appears to be SoFi . The stock rose 4.5% on Wednesday and got an upgrade to buy at Mizuho . \"Pulling forward the end of the moratorium to [December] can help improve clarity, and may also result in a pull-forward in refi demand in 4Q22, similar to what occurred in late 4Q21. \u2026 With the cap put on income of $125K, those with higher income have little benefit of waiting to re-finance,\" Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev wrote in a note upgrading SoFi. But it is not just fintech companies that benefit from student loan refinancing. Some old-school banks have also reached into that business as well, including Citizens Financial. \"The net pros and cons of [the announcement] actually increases the opportunity for banks on the refi side,\" said Brendan Coughlin, the head of consumer banking at Citizens Financial. \"And so we do expect, in sort of late fourth quarter into the first half of next year, for there to be a decent number of students who have the refi incentive that have recently graduated and are in the money. \u2026 I think there will be a little bit of a burst of activity in the space.\" Other financial institutions can also offer student loan refinancing as part of a personal line of credit. Macro considerations One potential drawback to the refinancing business is rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve's target policy rate was below 2% when the pandemic hit. After being slashed to zero during Covid, the Fed is hiking again, and its benchmark rate is widely expected to be above 3% by the end of the year. That shift means that refinancing may not be as attractive to many borrowers who took out fixed-rate loans when rates and inflation were lower. \"We expect as this new crop of borrowers are going to school and borrowing the Grad PLUS programs at higher interest rates, that as interest rates stabilize and begin to come down, that demand will return. But right now, as I said in my comments, two-thirds of the eligible customer base that we see in the federal loans base, really \u2014 their interest rates on their current loans are below what we can offer,\" Navient CEO John Remondi said on an earnings call last month, according to a FactSet transcript. Navient purchased student loan company Earnest in 2017. BTIG analyst Isaac Boltansky said in a note on Thursday that Biden's move was \"neutral to slightly negative for Navient \u2026 as it marginally reduces the size of the market that can be refinanced in the future\" For Citizens, Coughlin said that the higher rate environment does limit refinancing but should still be an attractive option for borrowers with higher incomes and good credit scores. Additionally, for businesses with other consumer credit businesses beside student loans, the change could affect credit quality for customers. \"Forgiveness could temporarily improve subprime credit quality, but resumption of payments adds to credit deterioration risks in 2023,\" Morgan Stanley economist Sarah Wolfe wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. Coughlin added that the cancellation does raise some questions about borrower behavior going forward now that the government has already trimmed student debt once. \"When you refi to a private student loan, the potential of that [cancellation] benefit doesn't exist anymore, so will students hold back on that hoping the administration does something more aggressive? I think that's highly unlikely, but attitudinally could be something that is in a lot of students' minds,\" Coughlin said. Loan servicers Another piece of the student debt puzzle is the servicing companies. Navient transferred its federal student loan servicing business to Maximus late last year, but does still work with old Family Federal Education Loans. Because many of those loans are privately held, they are not expected to be forgiven, though some borrowers may be able to get those loans reclassified. \"Given the fact that the announcement (at least on its face) appears to be limited to loans owned by the Federal Government (we should get confirmation of this when the details are released over the coming weeks) it has less of an impact on holders of FFELP loans such as Navient or Nelnet ,\" Credit Suisse analyst Moshe Orenbuch said in a note to clients. Nelnet, meanwhile, also services federally held student loans, which generates fee revenue for the firm. Orenbuch said that Biden's announcement could be a \"modest negative\" for Nelnet as borrowers whose full debt is forgiven will be removed from the student loan system. Scott Buchanan, the executive director of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, said that servicers will likely get additional revenue from the government for upgrading their systems to handle the cancellation and other changes to student loan programs, which could help offset the decline of servicing revenue. Nelnet's stock fell roughly 1.2% on Wednesday when Biden's plan was announced, and it is down about 12% for the year. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

Those hopes have not come to fruition, said Katherine Baicker, the dean of the University of Chicago\u2019s Harris School of Public Policy, who studies the economics of health care. And as a result, costs have remained high for taxpayers.\n\n\u201cPolicies that are designed to solve one problem,\u201d like expanding health coverage, she said, \u201chave to be realistic about the financing that goes along with it.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden and Democrats made another attempt this month to rein in health costs, imposing limits on prescription drug spending through Medicare in a sweeping bill called the Inflation Reduction Act. That bill also includes the most ambitious effort by the federal government to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change: nearly $400 billion in spending and tax incentives meant to encourage the growth of wind and solar electricity, electric vehicles and other emissions-limiting technologies.\n\nThose measures join a growing list of administration efforts to regulate emissions across the economy. But for several reasons, most notably the political difficulties of taxing consumers, the bill did not impose a tax on fossil fuels.\n\nMany environmental economists have moved away from their long-held view that such taxes are the best way to reduce emissions. But most of them still say raising the price of fossil fuels, in hopes of discouraging their use, is an important complement to government subsidies of low-carbon fuels \u2014 part of a balanced diet, so to speak, that yields a faster, more efficient transition away from planet-warming oil, gas and coal.\n\nThe political perils of high gasoline prices all but assured Mr. Biden would not pursue a tax on fossil fuels. But White House officials have also grown increasingly bullish on the idea that regulations and subsidies are enough to meet his goal of cutting emissions 50 percent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade.",

While Mr. Powell greeted a slowdown in inflation in July as good news, he said it was not enough to determine that the Fed\u2019s mission was on its way to being accomplished.\n\n\u201cLower inflation readings for July are welcome, a single month\u2019s improvement falls far short of what the committee will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down,\u201d he said, referring to the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, climbed 6.3 percent over the year through July, a slowdown from the prior month but still far above the 2 percent average that the Fed shoots for. Price increases are showing hopeful signs of waning for some types of goods, but much of the recent slowdown has been driven by a pullback in fuel prices, which are volatile.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really premature to even think that inflation has peaked,\u201d Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said during an interview on Yahoo Finance on Friday. \u201cThe July inflation report had some positives, it was welcome news, but it was based on, basically, a downturn in energy prices, and we know they\u2019re volatile.\u201d",

                "text": "For 106 years, La Segunda has baked bread in Ybor City, a neighborhood in Tampa, Florida. It\u2019s a Cuban bakery where the loaves are scored with palmetto fronds and reach 36\u201d in custom ovens. Between the longstanding traditions and myths that shape the place, the owners that span four generations have never seen prices rise as they have in the past year.\n\nAcross America, inflation affected the food industry acutely, and in the case of La Segunda, the cost of wheat doubling in just 12 months left a bruise. \u201cThat\u2019s 30% to 40% of our manufacturing,\u201d said Copeland More, a partner alongside his father in the business.\n\nThe jump in cost added nearly $40,000 to overhead each month, and it left More to navigate just how to raise prices, retain customers, and keep the 140 employees across three bakeries above water.\n\nIn Tampa, the cost of living rose at a rate in the past year that dwarfed the rest of the United States, by more than 3%. For Daniel Mitchell, who started working at La Segunda just six months ago as a technician, he felt the pressure.\n\nDaniel Mitchell, a technician for La Segunda Bakery, has felt the pressure of Tampa\u2019s rising cost of living. Photograph: Zack Wittman/The Guardian\n\nHis days just kept stretching. The more time he spent traversing Tampa Bay as a construction contractor, the less troubling the increasing cost of living for his family seemed. But after long days, he\u2019d make it home just in time to tuck his kids into bed and leave before they opened their eyes.\n\nBy the time the pandemic reached Tampa, construction ground to a halt, so he took a second job. Then, he took a third. Twelve hour days bled into fifteen hours. Soon, Mitchell left construction completely to keep pace with the 10% increase in rent and 7% in food alongside childcare.\n\nHis wife, Ciera, who already worked at La Segunda, suggested talking to her manager. She made good on the promise, and Mitchell made good on their faith when they hired him as a maintenance technician. \u201cNow I only have to work one place,\u201d he said and with the regular hours, he gets home in time to see his kids before the sun sets.\n\nStill, although the stress of multiple jobs and long days has ebbed, the cost of living continues to climb, and so the Mitchells have given up eating out and paid careful attention to just how they\u2019re spending their money. \u201cNow it\u2019s more of a necessity, you know what I mean?\u201d Mitchell said, \u201cHolding onto money, saving, because you never know.\u201d\n\nA rise in the cost of living\n\nThe rising cost of everything in Tampa has become as commonplace as the storms that build up on the Gulf\u2019s edge nearly every afternoon in the summer.\n\nAcross the country, the cost of rent, food and housing grew exponentially this past year. Nationally, the cost of inflation hovered around 8% according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nBut along the Gulf of Mexico, Tampa dwarfed the national average, often by three points. While tourism revenues ballooned, low wages stagnated. Insurance rates rose as jobless claims alongside evictions and property taxes edged toward insurmountable for many residents. The region saw some of the fastest growing rents in all of America according to real estate academics \u2013 more than a 30% jump.\n\nCopeland More, owner of La Segunda Bakery, agreed to raise wages when the cost of living began to rise in 2020. Photograph: Zack Wittman/The Guardian\n\nAt La Segunda, when the cost of living began to climb in 2020, More and his managers agreed to raise wages. \u201cWe got ahead of the game,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019ve always had full benefits.\u201d\n\nLike the rest of the country, restaurants shuttered across Tampa Bay, and turnover among employees spread like wildfire. At La Segunda, \u201cWe raised prices on everything,\u201d More said. He feared losing customers, but as the temperature broke 100F (38C) this past month, the line of people waiting outside in Ybor and the humming dining room at their Kennedy location reassured him.\n\nFor La Segunda, bread animates the business, with wholesale to customers around the country making up almost 75% of its revenue. In each shift, the bakers produce between 3,000 and 5,000 loaves by hand.\n\nLa Segunda bakers produce between 3,000 and 5,000 loaves of bread by hand in each shift.

Photograph: Zack Wittman/The Guardian\n\n\u201cI think what we do is kind of a dying art,\u201d More said of producing that much bread by hand. \u201cIt\u2019s just difficult. You\u2019re on your feet. It\u2019s hot. It\u2019s manual labor. It\u2019s repetitive labor.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s part of why La Segunda built out a retirement program for its employees that ensured they could retire, take vacation or see a doctor. Many of the bakers are older, and More told them, \u201cYou guys can\u2019t work here forever.\u201d\n\nAt first, everyone was skeptical, but in time they came around to the idea of their wages being set aside. And over the years, More and his family helped employees secure housing or put together the financing to buy a place, but now when he talks to his employees and managers, he said, \u201cHousing costs are outrageous. You basically can\u2019t live unless you\u2019re at this wage. I\u2019m thinking to myself, \u2018It just doesn\u2019t add up.\u2019 You know?\u201d\n\nAll throughout Tampa Bay, the concentration of for sale signs along the road, empty storefronts, and people panhandling at intersections told another story inextricably tied to the city.\n\nLoaves of dough rest in a proofer at La Segunda\u2019s location in Seminole Heights, Florida. The bakery set up a retirement program for its employees. Photograph: Zack Wittman/The Guardian\n\n\u2018Food is the door\u2019\n\nNorth of La Segunda on Nebraska Avenue in Seminole Heights is where Nancy Hernandez\u2019s hope to build a food pantry began in 2007.\n\nBut long before there was a physical space, she carried a five-gallon bucket filled with water and sandwiches up and down the street talking to people. By 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic, she started dispensing food with a box truck before she and her husband signed the lease on a physical space in 2021.\n\nHernandez has never seen such an urgent need as she has over the last two years. When they moved into the single story storefront, Hernandez built out a small church, an office, and devoted the lion\u2019s share to food storage. They named it Ministerio Mujeres Restauradas por Dios or \u201cThe Ministry of Women Restored by God\u201d.\n\nNancy Hernandez, started a food panty, Pantry Multiplicaci\u00f3n, in Seminole Heights, Florida. Photograph: Zack Wittman/The Guardian\n\nIn the blue light before the sun even hints at rising, Hernandez and her husband stock the pantry, like playing a careful game of Tetris to make sure everything fits in the limited coolers they have. They started with food, because as Hernandez said, \u201cFood is the door.\u201d She ran through how everybody\u2019s rent in this neighborhood rose in the last year, but wages stayed the same. \u201cYou can only stretch it so much,\u201d she said.\n\nFor some of the families it begins with the inability to afford childcare, a missed day of work, or the sudden jump in rent many saw here. Soon, they\u2019re tiding themselves over in a hotel or a family member\u2019s living room and, as Hernandez explained, people who never imagined themselves standing in line for a food pantry are suddenly there.\n\nIn Tampa Bay, there\u2019s a patchwork of nonprofits devoted to providing aid to families like Hernandez\u2019s, and among the largest is Metropolitan Ministries. For James Dunbar, their senior director of outreach and prevention, he echoed Hernandez\u2019s sentiment when he explained how much broader the spectrum of families affected was.\n\nOf course, the most vulnerable families were still at risk here, but he noted how families that have never needed nor asked for help were standing in line for food or looking for help with rent, diapers, or their mortgage. \u201cNow it\u2019s our neighbors that have never had to ask,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s moving up the chain.\u201d\n\nNancy Hernandez started Pantry Multiplicaci\u00f3n, which just found a storefront in 2021, when she began to see the need in her community. Photograph: Zack Wittman/The Guardian\n\nPantry Multiplicaci\u00f3n started with food, because as Hernandez said, \u2018Food is the door.\u2019 Photograph: Zack Wittman/The Guardian\n\nBack on Nebraska Avenue, Nancy Hernandez ferried back and forth between her office and the pantry as her husband left to pick up a food donation in the truck. On Friday, the pantry would open, but it was unclear how many more months they could afford to stay here.\n\nIn June, the landlord, who previously had been extremely flexible and understanding, let Hernandez know that the rent would double come July. The space, previously $1,500, would now cost $3,000 a month. For now, Hernandez focused on finding space for the donations on their way to the pantry, but as the day wore on, she wondered how long they might sustain themselves here, and so, she prayed.\n\nSoraya Aguirre, a volunteer with Pantry Multiplicaci\u00f3n peers out the front door of the pantry. Photograph: Zack Wittman/The Guardian\n\nBack at the bakery, the next shift of bakers set to work as the last customers of the day left with pastries and Cuban sandwiches. More, looking over the projected cost of wheat in the coming months saw some promise as the prices dipped slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s been a challenge,\u201d he said, \u201cBut it\u2019s just figuring out solutions around the problems, being proactive, and getting ahead of it.\u201d\n\nThe same set of questions haunt him today as when he joined his father as partner. How do you keep pace with the cost of goods while keeping customers? How do you take care of your employees while staying afloat? The past year only galvanized those questions.",

Brandon Bell | Getty Images\n\nJuly's consumer price index report finally showed a sign of potential relief \u2013 inflation ticked up less than expected from a year ago, and was flat on the month, meaning that a basket of items and services generally stayed the same price. But some items have fallen, on a monthly and weekly basis, potentially signaling that inflation has passed its peak and may be cooling off. This is welcome news to consumers who have been squeezed by higher prices and are looking for any sign of relief. Some of the top items whose prices have come down include eggs, milk and gasoline.\n\n\"Fuel inflation was really big and that's going to have a pretty meaningful impact on consumers and their spending patterns,\" said John Leer, chief economist at Morning Consult. \"I think that's actually a good thing for the economy.\"\n\nGrocery aisle prices down\n\nMany of the items that have declined are tied to food and energy, often the most volatile costs that consumers deal with. Grocery store staples have dipped. Large white eggs cost, on average, $2.14 for a dozen, during the week of Aug. 15-21, according to the USDA. That's a whopping 60 cent drop from the prior week, when the average was $2.74 per dozen.\n\nThe average price for a gallon of milk slipped to $3.16 from $3.24 during the period of Aug. 8-12 from the previous month, and the average price of butter fell to $3.67 from $4.68 in the same timeframe, per USDA data. Chicken breast prices also slipped on a weekly basis during the period of Aug. 8-12, but other parts of the chicken are declining as well \u2013 chicken wing prices have been trending down and are now cost less than they did pre-pandemic, according to data from the Department of Agriculture.\n\nOil pulled down fuel prices\n\nOutside of food, declines can be seen in consumer goods and services related to energy. This is because oil prices are often subject to big price swings as the balance between supply and demand shifts. This year, the war between Russia and Ukraine threw that balance off and the price of oil spiked when countries stopped buying from Russia, a major exporter. However, oil prices have come back down, lowering the cost of energy and particularly gasoline. The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline is $3.918 as of Friday, according to AAA. While that's higher than it was a year ago, it's a solid decline from the $4.495 consumers were paying for gas a month ago, and a sharp drop from the recent high of $5.016 hit in June.\n\nI think consumers increasingly believe that inflation is going to come down. John Leer chief economist at Morning Consult\n\nThat also potentially affected another area of the economy that saw a price dip month over month \u2013 airfares. The average price of a domestic airline ticket has dropped to $295 in August from $332 in July, according to travel site Hopper. That's also back in-line with the average price for a domestic ticket in the same month in 2019. Outside of fuel costs, this dip in ticket prices could be because consumer demand is fading, according to according to Kevin Gordon, a senior investment research manager at Schwab. \"That could be demand destruction,\" he said, adding that the reopening from pandemic lockdowns inflated the price of things as consumers rushed to take vacations again. Now, as vacation season is winding down, that demand has fallen off.\n\nOne month doesn't make a trend",

                "text": "Friday at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Federal Reserve chairperson Jerome Powell said the Fed must continue to raise interest rates, even though it will \u201cbring some pain to households and businesses\u201d.\n\nThis \u2013 with all due respect \u2013 is nuts.\n\nTrue, inflation is near a four-decade high. But the Fed\u2019s aggressive effort to tame it through steep interest rate hikes \u2013 the fastest series of rate hikes since the early 1980s \u2013 raises the risk of recession. Powell\u2019s remarks signal that the Fed will probably increase rates again in September by another three-quarter of a percent, raising the risk still further.\n\nThe pain is already being felt across the land. Wage gains haven\u2019t kept up with inflation. This means most Americans continue to lose economic ground.\n\nPowell is in effect telling them they\u2019ll lose even more ground. Higher interest rates, he admits, will slow economic growth and result in \u201csofter\u201d labor market conditions \u2013 a euphemism for lower wage increases and fewer jobs. But \u201cthese are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, though, corporate profits continue to soar. Profit margins are at their highest since 1950, according to Commerce Department figures published Thursday.\n\nStop for a moment and let your mind dwell on this: the prices businesses are charging their customers are outpacing whatever increased costs businesses are facing for materials and labor.\n\nIn other words, wages aren\u2019t pushing up inflation. The costs of production aren\u2019t pushing up inflation.\n\nCorporations are pushing up inflation. The biggest single unique source of inflation in the United States is the pricing power of corporations.\n\nSo why is the Fed raising interest rates? Because that\u2019s what the Fed does when prices are rising. That\u2019s the only tool in the Fed\u2019s toolkit. To quote the old saying, when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail \u2013 or, in this case, an interest rate to hike.\n\nThe problem: this mostly burdens working people and the low-income with fighting inflation. They\u2019re the first to lose pay and jobs as the economy slows. They\u2019re already getting hammered.\n\nIf the Fed continues to raise rates to slow inflation, they\u2019ll get hammered even more.\n\nThis might be justifiable if corporations were investing their windfall profits in more productive capacity \u2013 adding factories, materials, warehouses, and jobs \u2013 which would expand their ability to meet future demand and thereby better guarding against inflation.\n\nBut they aren\u2019t. They\u2019re using their profits to buy back their shares of stock so that their share values won\u2019t sag too much further after already sagging due to the anticipated Fed-induced slowdown.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, Goldman Sachs estimated that 2022 would see a record-breaking $1tn in buybacks. That\u2019s unlikely to happen, but buybacks are continuing at a strong pace. In the second quarter, buybacks were up by about 7% over the year before.\n\nSome economists argue that there\u2019s no reason to think corporations would now exert more pricing power than they\u2019ve had all along. Why would they wait for the costs of materials and labor to rise before increasing their profit margins?\n\nThe answer is simple. Inflation gives them cover. They can say \u2013 as many now do \u2013 that they have no choice but to raise prices in light of the rising costs of materials and labor. They\u2019re just not advertising the fact that their profits are rising as they do so.\n\nWhich brings us to the central policy question: why can\u2019t the burden of fighting inflation be placed where it belongs \u2013 on big corporations continuing to raise their prices in pursuit of larger profit margins and higher share prices?\n\nThe simple answer is big corporations have so much political clout that they\u2019d never allow the sorts of policies that would have that effect \u2013 say, a windfall profits tax, price controls, higher taxes on themselves and the wealthy, and bolder and more effective antitrust enforcement.\n\nAlthough the Democrats did pass a 1% percent tax on stock buybacks in the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act, they weren\u2019t able to take these other steps. Not even a Democratic president and Democrats in control of both houses of Congress could overcome vested corporate interests.\n\nSo it\u2019s all on Jerome Powell and the Fed. Which means, it\u2019s all on working people.",

                "text": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivered a stern commitment Friday to halting inflation, warning that he expects the central bank to continue raising interest rates in a way that will cause \"some pain\" to the U.S. economy.\n\nIn his much-anticipated annual policy speech at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Powell affirmed that the Fed will \"use our tools forcefully\" to attack inflation that is still running near its highest level in more than 40 years.\n\nEven with a series of four consecutive interest rate increases totaling 2.25 percentage points, Powell said this is \"no place to stop or pause\" even though benchmark rates are probably around an area considered neither stimulative nor restrictive to growth.\n\n\"While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,\" he said in prepared remarks. \"These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.\"\n\nStocks fell after the Powell speech, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off more than 500 points. Treasury yields were off their highs of the session.\n\nThe remarks come amid signs that inflation may have peaked but is not showing any marked signs of decline.\n\nTwo closely watched gauges, the consumer price index and the personal consumption expenditures price index, showed prices little changed in July, owing largely to a steep drop in energy costs.\n\nAt the same time, other areas of the economy are slowing. Housing in particular is falling off rapidly, and economists expect that the huge surge in hiring over the past year and a half is likely to cool.\n\nHowever, Powell cautioned that the Fed's focus is broader than a month or two of data, and it will continue pushing ahead until inflation moves down closer to its 2% long-range goal.\n\n\"We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2%,\" he said. Looking into the future, the central bank leader added that \"restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.\"\n\nThe economy is coming off consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, a commonly held definition of a recession. However, Powell and most other economists see the underlying economy as strong if slowing.\n\n\"In essence, Powell is clearly stating that right now, fighting inflation is more important than supporting growth,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial.",

                "text": "A high street decorated with British Union Jack bunting in Penistone, UK. The End Fuel Poverty Coalition has warned \"a tsunami of fuel poverty will hit the country this winter.\" Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nLONDON \u2014 Facing soaring energy bills, rising costs and rapidly declining consumer purchasing power, small businesses across the U.K. are struggling to make ends meet. New data on Wednesday showed U.K. inflation jumped to a 40-year high of 10.1% in July as food and energy costs continued to soar, exacerbating the country's cost-of-living crisis. The Bank of England expects consumer price inflation to top out at 13.3% in October, with the country's average energy bills (set via a price cap) expected to rise sharply in the fourth quarter to eventually exceed an annual \u00a34,266 ($5,170) in early 2023. On Wednesday, a director of U.K. energy regulator Ofgem quit over its decision to add hundreds of pounds to household bills, accusing the watchdog of failing to strike the \"right balance between the interests of consumers and the interests of suppliers.\" Real wages in the U.K. fell by an annual 3% in the second quarter of 2022, the sharpest decline on record, as wage increases failed to keep pace with the surging cost of living. A new survey published Friday also showed consumer confidence falling to its lowest level since records began in 1974. 'Absolute madness' \"While the energy price caps do not apply to businesses directly, millions of small business owners are still experiencing increased energy bills at a time when costs are rising in most operational areas,\" said Alan Thomas, U.K. CEO at insurance firm Simply Business. \"Simultaneously, consumer purchasing power is going down as Brits cut back on non-essential spending, harming the books of SME [small and medium-sized enterprise] owners.\" This assessment was echoed by Christopher Gammon, e-commerce manager at Lincs Aquatics \u2014 a Lincolnshire-based store and warehouse providing aquariums, ponds and marine livestock. The business has seen its energy costs rise by 90% so far since the war in Ukraine began, Gammon told CNBC on Thursday, and its owners are provisioning for further increases in the coming months.\n\n\"We are combating the rising cost with switching everything to LED, solar panels, wind turbines (planning in process) and closing down unused systems,\" Gammon said. \"We have also had to increase the price of products \u2014 most of these have been livestock as they are now costing more to look after.\" Customers are increasingly withdrawing from keeping fish and reptiles due to the cost of maintenance, and on Wednesday the store had a customer bring in a snake they could no longer afford to care for. The spiraling costs forced Lincs Aquatics to close a store in East Yorkshire, laying off several workers, while trying to offer pay rises to staff at its two remaining locations in Lincolnshire in order to help them through the crisis. The business is also working to expand its online shop due to rising in-store upkeep costs, as heating water for marine aquariums and purchasing pump equipment become ever more expensive. In early July, a quarterly survey from the British Chambers of Commerce found that 82% of businesses in the U.K. saw inflation as a growing concern for their business, with growth in sales, investment intentions and longer-term turnover confidence all slowing.\n\n\"Businesses face an unprecedented convergence of cost pressures, with the main drivers coming from raw materials, fuel, utilities, taxes, and labor,\" said BCC Head of Research David Bharier. \"The continuing supply chain crisis, exacerbated by conflict in Ukraine and lockdowns in China, has further compounded this.\" BCC Director General Shevaun Haviland added that \"the red lights on our economic dashboard are starting to flash,\" with almost every indicator deteriorating since the March survey. Phil Speed, based in Lincolnshire, England, liaises with brokers to find energy deals for business clients. He told CNBC earlier this week that for the first time in 10 years, he had been unable to obtain a better deal for a client than their out-of-contract rate \u2014 the typically expensive rates paid when a business or individual does not have a contracted deal in place. \"I think the unit rate she was quoting was 60p [pence] a unit for gas, which is just ridiculous. I'd imagine a year ago, we'd have been looking at 5 or 6p. It's just absolute madness,\" Speed said. \"We've got no idea what's going to be presented to us, because we've got no idea what's going to happen. The price is just going ballistic. No-one's going to buy it.\" The cost of gas for both businesses and consumers is only expected to increase through the colder winter months. Speed noted that local cafes cooking on gas will likely struggle, as they have no choice but to continue using it, unless they can replace gas appliances with electric ones. 'Scream very loudly at somebody' Rail strikes have already brought the country to a halt on multiple days throughout the summer and look set to continue, while postal workers, telecoms engineers and dock workers have all voted to strike as inflation erodes real wages. Conservative leadership favorite Liz Truss was earlier this month forced into a dramatic U-turn on a plan to cut public sector pay outside London, which would have axed wages for teachers, nurses, police and the armed forces alike. Local authorities recently offered state school support staff a flat pay rise of \u00a31,925 per year, meaning a 10.5% increase for the lowest-paid staff and just over 4% for the highest earners, after pressure from three of the country's largest unions. One woman in her early fifties \u2013 a member of support staff at a state school in Lincolnshire who asked not to be named due to the sensitive situation and concerns on public reprisals \u2013 told CNBC that years of real-terms pay cuts had left many low-paid public sector workers struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe British government in 2010, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, announced a two-year pay freeze for public sector workers, followed by a 1% average cap on public sector pay awards which was lifted in 2017, with average pay rises increasing to roughly 2% by 2020. While the 10.5% rise for the lowest-paid school support staff will ease the pressure, the woman said her energy costs had doubled and her private landlord had attempted to increase her rent by \u00a340 per month, which she had not agreed to and which may mean she would need to sell her car to cover basic living expenses. She called on the government to temporarily reduce the \"standing charge,\" a fixed daily amount households have to pay on most gas and electricity bills no matter how much they actually use, and to up its efforts to recoup one-off \"windfall taxes\" from energy companies such as BP, Shell and Centrica, which are reporting record profits.. \"I think this is an even bigger crisis than [the Covid-19 pandemic], because this is going to affect not just lower earners, but maybe even middle earners as well, because I don't see how anybody can absorb those kinds of energy costs,\" she said.",

                "text": "Britain is facing a wave of coordinated industrial action by striking unions this autumn in protest at the escalating cost of living crisis, the Observer can reveal.\n\nA series of motions tabled by the country\u2019s biggest unions ahead of the TUC congress next month demand that they work closely together to maximise their impact and \u201cwin\u201d the fight for inflation-related pay rises.\n\nThe move, which includes the two biggest unions, Unison and Unite, comes amid growing anger at the government\u2019s failure to agree a detailed package of help for families following Friday\u2019s announcement that average gas and electricity bills are to rise by 80%.\n\nWhile coordinated action would be short of a \u201cgeneral strike\u201d floated by some union leaders, Unite\u2019s motion would give the TUC the task of ensuring that walkouts are synchronised or deliberately staggered to deliver the greatest impact.\n\nBacked by the rail union RMT \u2013 which has led its members in a series of strikes in recent weeks \u2013 and the Communication Workers Union, which took action on Friday, Unite calls on the TUC to \u201cfacilitate and encourage industrial coordination between unions so workers in dispute can most effectively harness their union power to win\u201d.\n\nAnother motion from Unison, the country\u2019s biggest union, says the cost of living crisis is a \u201clow pay crisis\u201d and also demands that the TUC coordinate union action to campaign for pay rises \u201cat least in line with inflation\u201d \u2013 now 10.1% \u2013 as well as for a \u00a315 per hour minimum wage.\n\nThe signs of unrest underline the scale of the problem now facing the next Conservative prime minister, Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak, as soaring energy costs drive inflation further upwards. Union militancy will also place Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, in a difficult position. He recently called for his frontbenchers not to support the rail strikes.\n\nStarmer, whose party receives much of its funding from unions, is due to make his first speech in person as leader to the TUC Congress which opens in Brighton on 11 September.\n\nUnite general secretary Sharon Graham, whose 1,900 dockworker members at Felixstowe, the country\u2019s biggest port, are on an eight-day stoppage, cited the example of the ongoing rail dispute, which, she said, it was \u201ccritical\u201d that the RMT won.\n\n\u201cIf we were going on strike on the buses, why wouldn\u2019t we coordinate the two things?\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cYou want to make sure we give as much support as possible. Now, that\u2019s the role of the TUC to see you do that.\u201d\n\nGraham made it clear she was not talking about unlawful secondary action \u2013 one union not in dispute supporting another which is \u2013 but instead of coordination between unions whose members have voted to strike in separate pay disputes.\n\nWithin her own multi-sector union, she said, Felixstowe and Liverpool docks, both with mandates for industrial action over separate pay claims, could well be on strike at the same time. \u201cIf it helps them both to be on strike together, why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nMinisters will be alarmed at the extent of potential strike action reflected in the TUC motions.\n\nIn response to government plans to cut 91,000 civil service jobs, the First Division Association, representing senior civil servants, is calling on the next prime minister to abandon the \u201cdestructive approach of arbitrary job cuts\u201d, while the Public and Commercial Services Union calls on the TUC to \u201csupport industrial action aimed at preventing job cuts and coordinate such action with other unions in dispute where possible.\u201d\n\nWith unrest spreading, the GMB union is set to ballot more than 50,000 school support staff on whether to accept a \u00a31,925 pay rise offered by local government employers. The GMB is also balloting more than 100,000 local government workers over their pay deal, while the Royal College of Nursing is preparing to consult its members on whether they would be prepared to take strike action.\n\nSenior government sources said that Truss, the likely winner of the Conservative leadership contest, would be ready to hold an emergency budget with measures to help people with energy costs \u201cvery soon\u201d after the winner is announced on 5 September.\n\nWhile Truss has said on the campaign trail that her priority is to deliver tax cuts and not \u201chandouts\u201d, in recent days she has also made clear that she will help those most in need \u2013 without specifying what that would involve.\n\nGeorge Eustice, the environment secretary, said yesterday that people \u201cdon\u2019t have long to wait\u201d, but added that both Truss and Sunak would \u201cwant to look at all of the options, properly costed\u201d.",

                "text": "Initial filings for unemployment benefits declined slightly last week though they were consistent with a drift higher in layoffs that began in the spring, the Labor Department reported Thursday.\n\nJobless claims totaled 250,000 for the week ended Aug. 13, down 2,000 from the previous week and below the 260,000 Dow Jones estimate.\n\nThe four-week moving average for claims, which helps smooth out weekly volatility, also fell by 2,750 to 246,750.\n\nEarlier this year, claims had hit their lowest level in more than 50 years, but began moving higher in April after bottoming at 166,000. The four-week moving average has risen during that time by nearly 80,000.\n\nContinuing claims, which run a week behind the headline number, totaled 1.437 million, an increase of 7,000.\n\nPolicymakers are watching the jobs market closely at a time when inflation is running near 40-year highs. Federal Reserve officials have instituted a series of interest rate increases aimed in part at cooling a labor market in which there are nearly two jobs open for every available worker.\n\nAt their July meeting, Fed officials noted \"tentative signs of a softening outlook for the labor market\" that included a rise in weekly claims, according to minutes released Wednesday. Policymakers said they were determined to continue to raise interest rates until inflation under control even if meant more a slowdown in hiring.\n\n\"Unfortunately, what's good for the American worker is bad for the Fed's attempt to being inflation back down to 2% and this will complicate their job and cause them to raise rates higher and for longer than many people currently expect,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Investor Alliance.\n\nIn other economic news Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed reported that its monthly manufacturing survey for August rose to a reading of 6.2, representing the percentage difference between companies expecting expansion vs. contraction. That was an improvement over July's minus-12.3.\n\nThe level was above the estimate for a minus-5 and helped quell fears that manufacturing might be headed for a major slowdown. A similar survey on Monday from the New York Fed fell a stunning 40 points as respondents indicated that business conditions were deteriorating.\n\nThe indexes for prices paid and received both declined on the month, though they remain well into territory that indicates inflation is still present. Hiring also improved as did new orders, though the latter still registered a reading of minus-5.1.",

                "text": "As rising gas and electricity prices take centre stage after Ofgem set the October energy price cap at \u00a33,549, it is interesting to see how little other parts of the economy have reacted.\n\nA plentiful supply of cheap energy has underpinned every period of growth in national income over the past 70 years and the prospect of what was once ubiquitous and low cost becoming a major financial burden is one of the main reasons many economists predict that a recession will begin this autumn and run throughout next year.\n\nAt the moment these same forecasters don\u2019t envisage the drop in GDP being very deep. And that\u2019s because much else that underpins economic activity is expected to remain in rude health.\n\nOne of the pillars holding up growth is the property market. House price increases may have slowed in many areas, but they remain positive and continue to drive up values in coastal hotspots and desirable towns and suburbs to record highs.\n\nRents in the residential sector are also growing after a brief dip during the pandemic. Across the country, letting agents are so busy that their soaring commissions threaten to match the growth in mega-bonuses paid to investment bankers and private equity executives.\n\nIn July, while much of the nation was fretting about utility bills, rents in the capital rose 23% year on year\n\nDespite talk of levelling up, London\u2019s rental market has seen monthly rates soar by double digits to cement the capital as the go-to destination for young professionals. In July, while much of the nation was fretting about utility bills crippling their personal finances, rents in the capital rose 23% year on year, according to estate agency Foxtons, which says the number of renters competing for every property increased 27% over the same period.\n\nThe national average rise in rents demanded by landlords was 11.8%, says online agency Rightmove, pushing \u201casking rents\u201d outside London to another new record, of \u00a31,126 a month. In London, that monthly figure rose to \u00a32,257, with annual growth in asking prices now exceeding 15% across the capital, the highest ever annual rate of any region, by Rightmove\u2019s calculation.\n\nRenters regularly say there are 10 or 15 people turning up to view a property, such is the competition to secure a home in London. Much the same is said in other parts of the country, where rents may not be so high, but competition is equally fierce.\n\nOne reason for the sustained rise in rents can be found in figures showing a 40% fall in the number of flats and houses available to rent in the capital. The same fall can be seen in other regions and to an even greater extent in the number of property purchases since a high point last year. House purchases have halved since spring 2021, when Rishi Sunak ended a temporary cut in stamp duty.\n\nProperty owners are in a position to play a sophisticated game to maximise the value of their assets: making them available for rent or purchase when the price is right, and withdrawing them when it falls below their expectations.\n\nThere was a time when property was considered an illiquid market, based on assets that were difficult to buy and sell \u2013 and that is still true when compared with stocks and shares. However, the level of sophistication in the private sector \u2013 and the dominance of private developers now that public and social housing is fixed, adding little extra to the housing stock each year \u2013 means prices can be kept high indefinitely. Only a rise in unemployment can spoil private owners\u2019 plan of maintaining price growth and limiting the potential for rental values to fall.\n\nSo far the jobs market has proved robust. And while a recession is likely to increase the number of people out of work, the current demand for homes both to purchase and to rent will need to tumble to affect prices. The Bank of England believes the rate of unemployment will edge up about two percentage points over the next 18 months, from its current 40-year low of 3.8%.\n\nOfficials at the central bank are among the more pessimistic forecasters, but even this higher level of joblessness, and their own interest rate increases, are unlikely to spook the market.\n\nWhen asked by Rightmove in June, more landlords (34%) said they were planning to expand their portfolios over the next 12 months than said they would reduce them (11%) and it revised its forecast for growth in asking rents from 5% to 8%.\n\nLike the energy market, the property market is now well and truly rigged in favour of the owners and against their customers. Average monthly rents are now 40% higher than they were 10 years ago. After 12 years of Tory rule, it is yet another economic statistic that brings shame on the government.\n\n",

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a 0.1% increase in the top-line number and a flat total ex-autos. June's gain was revised down to 0.8% from 1%.\n\nRetail and food sales excluding gasoline and autos rose 0.7% from a month ago.\n\nThe numbers are adjusted seasonally but not for inflation, and come during a month when the consumer price index also was flat.\n\nA tumble in fuel prices off their record nominal highs pushed down sales at the pump, with gas station receipts off 1.8%. Motor vehicle and parts dealers sales also fell sharply, declining 1.6%.\n\nGas prices had eclipsed $5 a gallon in many locations earlier in the summer, but fell through July and most recently were at $3.94 a gallon for regular unleaded, according to AAA.\n\n\"People appear to have used some of the savings from lower gas prices to spend more on other items, both in nominal and \u2014 very likely \u2014 real terms,\" wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \"Auto sales have been severely constrained by the chip shortage, so pent-up demand likely is substantial. July's other losers were department stores and clothing retailers, but all these components are noisy and subject to revisions.\"",

Powell said the Fed would continue to use its tools \u201cforcefully\u201d until prices were under control. \u201cWe must keep at it until the job is done,\u201d said Powell.\n\nPowell warned there would be consequences to these actions, namely job losses and slower growth.\n\n\u201cWhile higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses. These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThese are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Fed was slow to react to rising inflation. At last year\u2019s meeting, Powell dismissed rising prices as a \u201ctransitory\u201d phase triggered by supply chain problems related to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBut as prices have risen at rates unseen since the 1980s the Fed has moved to hike interest rates aggressively and is all but guaranteed to do so again when its committee meets again in September.\n\nAt each of its last two meetings the Fed has increased its benchmark federal funds rate by 0.75 percentage points, to a range between 2.25% and 2.5%, the most rapid rate of increase since the early 1990s.\n\nThere are signs that the rate of price rises is slowing in the US. Gas prices have fallen markedly and on Friday the commerce department announced that the central bank\u2019s preferred measure of inflation \u2013 \u200b\u200bthe Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index \u2013 slowed in July to an annual rate of 6.3%, down from 6.8% in June. But the rate of inflation remains far above the Fed\u2019s target rate of 2%.\n\nPowell made clear that the recent good news was unlikely to sway the Fed from its course. \u201cWhile the lower inflation readings for July are welcome, a single month\u2019s improvement falls far short of what the committee will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down,\u201d he said.\n\nCentral bankers across the world are struggling with similar issues. In the UK economists have predicted inflation will hit 18% in 2023 and millions of households face an 80% energy bill rise from 1 October. China could miss its annual growth target for the first time since 2015 as factory activity falls and the property market faces a crisis.\n\nBy comparison, parts of the US economy remain strong, notably consumer spending and the jobs market, where unemployment is at a 50-year low. But Powell emphasized that tackling inflation was now the Fed\u2019s top priority.\n\n\u201cOur responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional,\u201d said Powell. \u201cIt is true that high inflation is a global phenomenon, and that many economies around the world face inflation as high or higher than seen here in the United States,\u201d but said that did not diminish the Fed\u2019s \u201cresponsibility to carry out our assigned task of achieving price stability\u201d.",

                "text": "Fast-food workers and supporters fight to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. James Leynse | Corbis Historical | Getty Images\n\nThe Biden administration seems to have pegged a student loan policy announced Wednesday to its broader push for a national $15-an-hour minimum wage. The White House detailed a long-awaited plan to forgive up to $20,000 in federal student debt for borrowers, and extended a payment pause through the end of 2022. But tucked into the broader package of policy measures were tweaks to \"income-driven repayment plans.\" These plans help make monthly payments more affordable for low-income borrowers. The administration linked one of those tweaks \u2014 specifically, one relative to a definition of \"non-discretionary\" income \u2014 to a $15 minimum wage.\n\nHow student debt ties to a $15 minimum wage\n\n\"Non-discretionary\" income is basically the income a household funnels into essentials like rent, mortgage payments and food. For borrowers in income-driven plans, the government protects their non-discretionary income by exempting it from repayment. The amount is based on household annual income relative to the federal poverty line.\n\nUnder current rules, a borrower with income of less than 150% of the federal poverty level qualifies for a $0 monthly loan payment. In 2022, that equates to roughly $20,385 before tax for a single individual \u2014 about $9.80 an hour for a full-time worker. President Biden proposed raising that threshold to 225% of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $30,577.50 of annual income, or $14.70 an hour. The policy guarantees that \"no borrower earning under 225% of the federal poverty level \u2014 about the annual equivalent of a $15 minimum wage for a single borrower \u2014 will have to make a monthly payment,\" according to the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nThe policy \u2014 which applies to undergraduate student loans \u2014 means more borrowers in income-driven plans would qualify for a $0 monthly payment or owe a smaller monthly bill, according to student loan experts. \"These changes make things more affordable for borrowers and allow borrowers to avoid default,\" according to Whitney Barkley-Denney, senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending.\n\nOther changes to income-driven repayment plans\n\nThe administration also simultaneously announced other reforms to income-driven plans. None of the measures are final yet. The Education Department is proposing regulations \"in the coming days,\" the agency said Wednesday. The public will have a 30-day window in which it can comment on the proposal, and then the Department would then use those comments to craft a final rule, which could differ from the proposal. In addition to the higher \"non-discretionary\" income threshold, monthly payments for borrowers would be capped at 5% of income; that'd be half the current 10% cap.\n\nIt's another way of continuing to push the idea that $15 should be the minimum wage. Abigail Seldin CEO of the Seldin/Haring-Smith Foundation\n\nBarkley-Denney offered an example of how this would work for a one-person household: Let's say a borrower has an income of $60,000 in 2022. As noted above, the first $30,577.50 would be considered \"non-discretionary\" and therefore protected from repayment. The remaining $29,422.50 would be \"discretionary\" and used to calculate the borrower's monthly payment. The new rules would cap those payments at 5% of discretionary income \u2014 roughly $123 a month versus $245 a month under the current 10% maximum.",

                "text": "The next month, the company announced a series of new benefits \u2014 including additional career development opportunities, better tipping options and more sick time \u2014 but only for stores that hadn\u2019t unionized or weren\u2019t in the process of unionizing. The benefits were to begin in the coming months.\n\nThe company unveiled wage increases as well, some of which had already been announced and which the company said would apply to all workers. But other increases were new and would apply only to nonunion workers.\n\nFor example, according to Reggie Borges, a Starbucks spokesman, all employees stood to benefit from a companywide $15-an-hour minimum wage, but nonunion workers hired by May 2 would get a 3 percent raise if that proved higher than $15.\n\nThe wage policy appears to have sown confusion, with some employees briefly receiving a pay increase that was then withdrawn. Colin Cochran, a worker at a store near Buffalo that initially voted to unionize and then voted against the union in a rerun election decided this month, provided pay stubs showing that his $16.28 hourly wage had increased to $16.77 the first week of August, when Starbucks began the pay increases nationwide. But Mr. Cochran\u2019s pay stub for the second week of August showed his hourly pay dropping back to $16.28. (The union is challenging the election loss at this store.)\n\nMr. Borges said that the reversion to the previous wage had resulted from an inadvertent error and that unionized stores would get wage increases in September.\n\nWorkers involved in union campaigns at other Starbucks locations said the denial of pay and benefit increases to unionized stores had slowed their organizing efforts.\n\nKylah Clay, a Starbucks worker in Boston who helped organize several stores in the area, said inquiries from employees at other stores who were interested in unionizing had dropped off substantially not long after the company\u2019s pay and benefits announcement in May. But they picked up recently after the pay and many benefit changes took effect, she said.",

Kent Nishimura | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Reserve's path to bringing down runaway inflation while keeping the economy from slipping into a major downturn is still open but is getting narrower, according to Goldman Sachs. As the central bank looks to keep raising interest rates, the economy is teeming with mixed signals: rapidly rising payroll figures against sharply declining housing numbers, falling gasoline prices vs. surging shelter and food costs, and low consumer sentiment against steady spending numbers. Amid it all, the Fed is trying to strike a balance between slowing things down, but not by too much. On that score, Goldman economists think there have been clear wins, some losses and a landscape ahead that poses substantial challenges. \"Our broad conclusion is that there is a feasible but difficult path to a soft landing, though several factors beyond the Fed's control can ease or complicate that path and raise or lower the odds of success,\" Goldman economist David Mericle said in a client note Sunday.\n\nSlow growth, high inflation\n\nOne of the biggest inflation drivers has been outsized growth that has created imbalances between supply and demand. The Fed is using interest rate increases to try to damp down demand so supply can catch up, and supply chain pressures, as measured by a New York Fed index, are at their lowest since January 2021. So on that score, Mericle said the Fed's efforts have \"gone well.\" He said the rate increases \u2014 totaling 2.25 percentage points since March \u2014 have \"achieved a much-need deceleration\" regarding growth and specifically demand. In fact, Goldman expects GDP to grow at just a 1% pace over the next four quarters, and that's coming off consecutive declines of 1.6% and 0.9%. Though most economists expect that the National Bureau of Economic Research will not declare the U.S. in recession for the first half of the year, the slow-growth path makes the Fed's balancing act more difficult. On a similar count, Mericle said the Fed's moves have helped narrow the supply-demand gap in the labor market, where there are still nearly two job openings for every available worker. That effort \"has a long way to go,\" he wrote. However, the biggest problem remains stubbornly high inflation. The consumer price index was flat in July but still rose 8.5% from a year ago. Wages are surging at a strong clip, with average hourly earnings up 5.2% from a year ago. Consequently, the Fed's efforts to halt a spiral in which higher prices feed higher wages and perpetuate inflation have \"shown little convincing progress so far,\" Mericle said. \"The bad news is that high inflation is broad-based, measures of the underlying trend are elevated, and business inflation expectations and pricing intentions remain high,\" he added.\n\nDoubts about the Fed's policy path\n\nFighting inflation might require higher rate hikes than the market currently anticipates. Goldman's projection is that the Fed raises benchmark rates by another percentage point before the end of the year, but Mericle acknowledged that there is \"upside risk\" due to \"the recent easing in financial conditions, the robust pace of hiring, and signs of stickiness in wage growth and inflation.\" Indeed, former New York Fed President William Dudley said Monday he thinks the market is underestimating the future path of rate hikes and, consequently, the risks of a hard landing or recession.\n\n\"The market is misunderstanding what the Fed is up to,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in a live interview. \"I think the Fed is going to be higher for longer than what market participants understand at this point.\" In Dudley's view, the Fed will keep hiking until it is sure inflation is heading back to the central bank's 2% target. Even by the most generous inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price index that the Fed follows, inflation is still running at 4.8%. \"The labor market is much tighter than the Fed wants. The wage inflation rate is too high, not consistent with 2% inflation,\" he added. Dudley expects the rates to keep going up until the employment dynamic has shifted enough to get the unemployment rate \"well above 4%,\" compared to its current level of 3.5%.",

                "text": "Liz Truss has been challenged to open up her prospective emergency tax cuts and spending plans to scrutiny if she becomes prime minister and makes immediate moves to tackle the cost of living crisis.\n\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which produces independent forecasts based on major fiscal announcements by the government, revealed preparatory work had been under way for about a month to publish fresh economic forecasts in September.\n\nRichard Hughes, the chair of the government\u2019s economic watchdog, said that \u2013 if asked by the new chancellor \u2013 it could publish its analysis on 14 or 21 September to the legally required standard.\n\nThe move puts the ball in Truss\u2019s court and means she would have to decline to ask the OBR to conduct its own analysis, which critics would argue was an attempt to evade scrutiny.\n\nMel Stride, the chair of the Treasury select committee, said it was vital the next prime minister committed to doing so, while Labour said there was \u201cno excuse\u201d for Truss trying to \u201cwriggle out of proper scrutiny\u201d.\n\nNormally, the OBR gets 10 weeks\u2019 notice of a major fiscal event or budget to begin preparations.\n\nHowever, the new Tory leader will be announced on 5 September and take office a day later, and would be forced to react quickly to the worsening economic outlook, compounded by spiralling energy bills after the price cap hike.\n\nIt was reported by the Financial Times that Truss had downgraded her emergency budget planned for mid-September to a more minor fiscal event to bring in tax cuts and set out her wider economic outlook. It would therefore not necessitate full OBR forecasts about the state of the economy.\n\nBut with rocketing inflation and the price cap for average household energy bills rising by 80%, some experts worry that her likely chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, would be basing decisions on out-of-date advice without new information from the OBR.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

                "text": "The phoney war is over and the real struggle for the economy is about to begin. That is the brutal reality facing the UK as gas and electricity bills rocket this winter.\n\nFor months it has been clear the energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, would raise its price cap from just under \u00a32,000 a year to about the \u00a33,500 mark and it has duly announced an 80% increase.\n\nUltimately, rocketing prices will have some beneficial effects. Renewable sources of energy will become relatively cheaper and their use will increase. With Whitehall \u201cwar-gaming\u201d a scenario in which there are energy shortages in the months ahead, a higher priority will be given to energy self-sufficiency.\n\nBusinesses found ingenious ways of coping with lockdown and some are being equally creative when it comes to cutting energy usage. The crisis may lead to a long overdue stepping up of investment in home insulation.\n\nBut none of that will really have much impact this winter, which looks likely to be as tough as anything that was seen during the pandemic \u2013 and potentially much tougher.\n\nConsumer and business confidence has weakened in anticipation of the higher bills to come but the economy has been marking time. Activity remained pretty much unchanged in the second quarter of 2022, retail sales were up in July and unemployment is close to its lowest levels in half a century.\n\nHowever, that is all about to change \u2013 unless the government comes up with something big in terms of a support package covering consumers and business. Current support packages anticipated a price cap in October of \u00a32,800, not the \u00a33,549 that Ofgem announced on Friday morning. The idea that prices could carry on rising and stay high for at least the next year was simply not factored into any official economic forecasts.\n\nSoaring energy bills affect the economy in three key ways. First, they push up the cost of living, with the new price figure adding about four percentage points to the annual inflation rate. The Bank of England has already factored the October increase into its forecast for inflation to reach 13.3%.\n\nYet with the still rising global cost of gas now putting the price cap on course to breach the \u00a35,000 a year threshold in January, the increase in price pressures could turn out to be much more significant. Earlier this week the US investment bank Citi predicted inflation would peak at more than 18% next year.\n\nThreadneedle Street has raised interest rates at the last six meetings of its monetary policy committee, and further increases are likely over the coming months.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wage rates have been picking up over the past year as workers have sought to maintain their living standards \u2013 but not nearly as fast as prices have been rising. That gap is growing, and with consumers forced to spend more on energy they have less to spend on other things.\n\nThird, businesses are going to be hurt by increased costs and a reduction in consumer spending. The energy price cap only applies to consumers, and many small and medium-sized companies are going to face a triple whammy: higher fuel bills, higher wage bills, and falling demand.\n\nIn the short run, the energy price shock will be inflationary. As the months roll by it will become deflationary, leading to slower growth, rising unemployment and business failures. The longer gas prices stay high, the deeper the recession will be.",

Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, provides an update on the economic outlook that could detail how the central bank is thinking about inflation and the path ahead for interest rates.\n\nMr. Powell\u2019s speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\u2019s annual conference near Jackson, Wyo., is always closely watched. But it is getting special scrutiny this year as investors grasp for any hint at what might come next for the Fed, which has been raising rates rapidly in its campaign to tamp down the fastest rate of inflation in 40 years. Markets are trying to guess when the central bank, which raised rates by an unusually quick three-quarters of a percentage point at each of its last two meetings, will slow down.\n\nInflation has shown some early signs of moderating, which could point toward a less aggressive Fed policy path. But prices are still increasing at more than three times the pace the Fed aims for, creating a pressing challenge for consumers who are struggling to afford day-to-day necessities like rent and food as wages fail to keep up.",

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting an increase of 0.2%.\n\nOn an annual basis, the index rose 9.8%, the lowest rate since October 2021. That compares with an 11.3% increase in June and the record 11.7% gain in March.\n\nMost of the decline came from energy, which dropped 9% at the wholesale level and accounted for 80% of the total decline in goods prices, which fell 1.8%. The index for services rose 0.1%.\n\nStripping out food, energy and trade services, PPI increased 0.2% in July, which was less than the expected 0.4% gain. Core PPI rose 5.8% from a year ago.\n\nThe numbers come a day after the consumer price index showed that inflation was flat in July though up 8.5% from a year ago. The easing in the CPI also reflected the slide in energy prices that has seen prices at the pump fall below $4 a gallon after hitting record nominal levels above $5 earlier in the summer.",

It said over 2 million customers had downloaded the app and together had collected \u00a37m in their cash pots, which they are able to spend at Asda.\n\nThe under-30s are among the hardest hit by sharp increases in the price of essentials including rent, groceries, transport costs and utility bills, Asda\u2019s research found, resulting in an almost 22% slide in disposable income for this group in July compared with a year earlier.\n\nAccording to Asda\u2019s income tracker, young people under 30 were left with a disposable income of just \u00a3150 per week after paying their taxes and essential bills, at a time of soaring inflation and cost of living crisis.",

But a federal measure in the United States, setting a cap on carbon emissions and letting companies trade their allotments, failed in 2010.\n\nAt the same time, Dr. Nordhaus\u2019s model was drawing criticism for underestimating the havoc that climate change would wreak. Like other models, it has been revised several times, but it still relies on broad assumptions and places less value on harm to future generations than it places on harm to those today. It also doesn\u2019t fully incorporate the risk of less likely but substantially worse trajectories of warming.\n\nDr. Nordhaus dismissed the criticisms. \u201cThey are all subjective and based on selective interpretation of science and economics,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cSome people hold these views, as would be expected in any controversial subject, but many others do not.\u201d\n\nHeather Boushey, a member of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers who handles climate issues, says the field is learning that simply tinkering with prices won\u2019t be enough as the climate nears catastrophic tipping points, like the evaporation of rivers, choking off whole regions and setting off a cascade of economic effects.\n\n\u201cSo much of economics is about marginal changes,\u201d Dr. Boushey said. \u201cWith climate, that no longer makes sense, because you have these systemic risks.\u201d She sees her current assignment as similar to her previous work, running a think tank focused on inequality: \u201cIt profoundly alters the way people think about economics.\u201d",

                "text": "A shopping cart is seen in a supermarket as inflation affected consumer prices in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., June 10, 2022. Andrew Kelly | Reuters\n\nIf inflation has been the biggest threat to U.S. economic growth, then July's data should provide signs that there's at least some relief in the pipeline. Prices were flat for the month as gauged by the items that the Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks for its consumer price index. That marked the first time the aggregate measure hadn't posted a month-over-month increase since May 2020, when the widely followed index showed a modest decline. Just a month ago, CPI posted its fastest 12-month gain since November 1982, following a trend that helped send economic growth into contraction for the first half of the year, stirring up talk of a recession. But with at least the short-term trend indicating the rate of price increases is abating, economic optimism is perking up.\n\nNo recession, for now\n\n\"The whole recession narrative really needs to be put on a shelf for now,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies. \"I think it's going to be shifting to a stronger-for-longer narrative, which is really supported by a reversal in inflation.\" Markowska, whose forecasts this year have been accurate, sees solid growth in the near term, including a 3% growth rate in the third quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow gauge, which tracks economic data in real time, pointed to a 2.5% growth rate in a Wednesday update, up 1.1 percentage points from its last one on Aug. 4. However, Markowska also expects pressures to intensify in 2023, with a recession likely in the back part of the year. Indeed, there was a little bit for both arguments in the CPI report. Most of the tempering in inflation came because of a fall in energy prices. Gasoline slid 7.7%, the biggest monthly decline since April 2020. Fuel oil tumbled 11% as energy-related commodity prices were off 7.6%.\n\nTransportation services cost increases also came off the boil, with airline fares tumbling 7.8% to reverse a trend that has seen tickets surge 27.7% over the past year. But there were few other signs of inflation declines in the report, with food costs particularly high. The food index, in fact, rose 1.1% on the month, and its 10.9% pace over the past 12 months is the highest since May 1979. That's causing worries at places such as City Harvest, which helps feed needy New Yorkers who have been hit especially hard by price surge that began last year. \"We're seeing many more children come into food pantries,\" said Jilly Stephens, the organization's CEO. \"Food insecurity had been intractable even before the pandemic hit. Now we're seeing even more people turn to food pantries because of the rising prices.\" Stephens said the number of children seeking food assistance about doubled a year after the Covid pandemic hit, and the organization is struggling to keep up. \"We're always optimistic, because we are supported by incredibly generous New Yorkers,\" she said.\n\nPeople keep spending\n\nDespite the surging prices, consumers have been resilient, continuing to spend even with inflation-adjusted wages contracting 3% over the past year. Jonathan Silver, CEO of Affinity Solutions, which tracks consumer behavior through credit and debit card transactions, said spending is at a healthy pace, rising about 10.5% over the past year, though inflation is influencing behavior. \"When you start to look at specific categories, there's been a lot of shifting in spending, and as a result, some categories are being impacted more than others by inflation,\" he said. \"People are delaying their spending on discretionary items.\" For instance, he said department store spending has fallen 2.4% over the past year, while discount store spending has risen 17%. Amusement park spending is down 18%, but movie theaters are up 92%. Some of those numbers are influenced by rising prices, but they generally reflect the level of transactions as well. As inflation eases, Silver expects discretionary spending to increase. \"We believe there will be a spike later in the year that will create an upward slope to the spending in key categories where the consumer has been delaying and deferring spending,\" he said. \"Consumers may get a holiday present of some relief on food prices.\"",

                "text": "About 16 million working-age Americans have long-term Covid and 2-4 million are out of work because of its ill effects, according to a new report from the Brookings Institution.\n\nEmployers have complained of labor shortages throughout the pandemic, and the analysis of data from the US Census Bureau\u2019s Household Pulse Survey, which collects data from Americans through a survey on education, employment, health and housing, suggests one possible reason for the lack of workers.\n\nThe report found that about 16 million Americans between 18 and 65 have long Covid. Of these people, who are considered of working age, they estimate that 2 to 4 million are out of work because of their symptoms.\n\nBrookings estimates that there are currently 10.6m unfilled jobs. The report estimates the dollar amount of the lost wages is between $170bn and $230bn a year.\n\nLong Covid, defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as Covid-related symptoms that last three or more months after first contracting the virus, has turned out to be a complicated beast. It is hard to track and study as symptoms can vary from individual to individual. Symptoms can range from gastrointestinal issues to nerve pain and fatigue.\n\nThe CDC in June estimated that nearly one in five American adults who had Covid-19 still have long Covid symptoms. Overall, one in 13 adults in the US \u2013 about 7.5% of the population \u2013 have long Covid.\n\nOther countries have reported similar problems with long Covid affecting employment. In a May speech, a Bank of England representative attributed the workforce shrinking by 440,000 largely to \u201cincreases in long-term sickness\u201d.\n\nEstimates say the US workforce has decreased by between 3 million and 3.5 million people over the course of the pandemic.\n\nThe report noted that addressing long Covid\u2019s impact on the workforce will entail policy measures like expanded paid sick leave and better employer accommodations. Over 25% of private sector workers do not have any form of paid sick leave. Of those in the bottom 25% of earners, over half do not have access to paid sick leave. Some workers have reported being fired for taking sick leave.",

                "text": "President Joe Biden's long-awaited plan to forgive student debt, announced Wednesday, drew immediate pushback from some lawmakers and consumer groups even as they praised the historic measure. The White House said it would cancel $10,000 in federal student debt for most borrowers and up to $20,000 for recipients of Pell Grants, which are available to undergraduates based on financial need. The plan may eliminate balances for at least 9 million borrowers, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.\n\nBiden 'should have, and could have, done much more'\n\nAstra Taylor, co-founder of the Debt Collective, a union for debtors, called Wednesday's announcement \"bittersweet.\" \"On the one hand, this is a landmark victory for our movement,\" she said in a statement. \"Yet, President Biden should have, and could have, done much more than cancel $10,000 or [$]20,000 \u2014 and he could have made the relief automatic, instead of imposing unnecessary hurdles.\"\n\nNearly 8 million borrowers may be eligible for automatic relief; however, some borrowers may need to apply if the U.S. Department of Education doesn't have relevant income data, according to the federal student aid website. That application isn't yet available. \"We intend to keep fighting until all student debt is canceled and college is free,\" Taylor said. \"If President Biden can cancel this much debt he can cancel it all.\" Biden paired the debt cancellation and payment pause with a measure to cap undergraduate loan repayments at 5% of monthly income.\n\nWarren, Schumer pledge to 'pursue every available path'\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., hailed the policy announcement Wednesday as \"the single most effective action that the President can take on his own to help working families and the economy.\" The duo had been pushing the White House to cancel up to $50,000 in federal student debt \u2014 and they alluded to an ongoing fight for more relief.\n\n\"Make no mistake, the work \u2014 our work \u2014 will continue as we pursue every available path to address the student debt crisis, help close the racial wealth gap for borrowers, and keep our economy growing,\" Schumer and Warren said.\n\nCanceling $10,000 'hardly achieves anything'\n\nDerrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP, lamented that Biden didn't cancel $50,000 of loans or more per borrower. He called student debt forgiveness a \"racial and economic justice issue\" that could help close the racial wealth gap, which often pushes Black students to borrow more than other students.\n\n\"Canceling just $10,000 of debt is like pouring a bucket of ice water on a forest fire,\" Johnson wrote in an op-ed. \"It hardly achieves anything \u2014 only making a mere dent in the problem.\" Data suggests that doubling the maximum forgiveness amount \u2014 to $20,000 \u2014 for Pell Grant recipients will most benefit Black student borrowers. To that point, 72% of Black students received a federal Pell Grant during the 2015-16 school year, about double the share of Asian and white students that year, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics. Carlos Moreno, a senior campaign strategist at the American Civil Liberties Union, applauded the policy's impact on Black borrowers. \"Student debt cancellation will help secure financial stability and mobility for people of color \u2014 particularly Black Americans \u2014 who are disproportionately burdened with student debt while providing immediate financial relief and peace of mind for millions of Americans,\" Moreno said.\n\nWe intend to keep fighting until all student debt is canceled and college is free. Astra Taylor co-founder of the Debt Collective\n\nForgiveness could 'make inflation even worse'",

On a monthly basis, the consumer price index was flat as energy prices broadly declined 4.6% and gasoline fell 7.7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That offset a 1.1% monthly gain in food prices and a 0.5% increase in shelter costs. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting headline CPI to increase 8.7% on an annual basis and 0.2% monthly.\n\nExcluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core CPI rose 5.9% annually and 0.3% monthly, compared with respective estimates of 6.1% and 0.5%.\n\nEven with the lower-than-expected numbers, inflation pressures remained strong. The jump in the food index put the 12-month increase to 10.9%, the fastest pace since May 1979. Butter is up 26.4% over the past year, eggs have surged 38% and coffee is up more than 20%. Despite the monthly drop in the energy index, electricity prices rose 1.6% and were up 15.2% from a year ago. The energy index rose 32.9% from a year ago. Used vehicle prices posted a 0.4% monthly decline, while apparel prices also fell, easing 0.1%, and transportation services were off 0.5% as airline fares fell 1.8% for the month and 7.8% from a year ago. Markets reacted positively to the report, with futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 400 points and government bond yields down sharply. \"Things are moving in the right direction,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies. \"This is the most encouraging report we've had in quite some time.\" The report was good news for workers, who saw a 0.5% monthly increase in real wages. Inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings were still down 3% from a year ago. Shelter costs, which make up about one-third of the CPI weighting, continued to rise and are up 5.7% over the past 12 months.",

My colleague Mabel Banfield-Nwachi reports that pressure on households is rising: Families are leaning on local services, charities and the generosity of others to help them afford even the basics. However, the leader of Burnley council, Afrasiab Anwar, says there is only so much goodwill they can rely on as more people struggle to get by and local services are stretched. In 2020, the council set up a charity in partnership with other local organisations to support the community during the pandemic. People could call Burnley Together for support to set up a debt repayment plan, get emergency food parcels, and advice on what benefits they were eligible for. It was supposed to be a short-term solution. Two years later, its services are expanding. \u201cThe frightening thing is that it\u2019s not just who you\u2019d typically regard as people who need that support. It\u2019s working families that are struggling to make ends meet and it\u2019s only going to get harder in autumn,\u201d says Anwar. \u201cIt\u2019s not just those who are the most vulnerable, it\u2019s going to hit everybody.\u201d Since 2010, the council\u2019s funding has dropped by 36%, approximately \u00a35m a year. \u201cFor a small council like ours, that\u2019s massive,\u201d Anwar says. \u201cThe government always talks about levelling up, but we have not seen that.

The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 large US companies has gained 136 points to 33,105, while the broader S&P 500 is up 1%. Stocks rallied during August, on hopes that the Federal Reserve might \u2018pivot\u2019, and slow the pace of its interest rate increases as the US economy slowed. Powell, though, may use Friday\u2019s speech to reiterate the Fed\u2019s hawkish position, and also acknowledge that inflation has not proved as transitory as he thought last year\u2026.

It predicts eurozone GDP will shrink in the current quarter, and again in October-December, before picking up early next year. Given the prospects of further significant energy price increases across the Eurozone - particularly in Germany - and the marked decline in the PMIs in July/August, we now expect the Eurozone to suffer negative q/q growth in Q3 and Q4 2022, followed by modestly positive growth in Q1 2023.

In the latest sign of the deepening energy crisis, business owners said they were struggling to find a supplier in the run-up to the busy October period for renewing gas and electricity contracts, leaving them facing \u201cextortionate\u201d bills or demands for a deposit. Suppliers named as having refused service, or asked for a downpayment, include SSE, Scottish Power, E.On Next, Drax and Ecotricity. Business owners called for urgent action from the government, warning that sectors such as hospitality, which already struggling with inflation and the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, are at particular risk. Teresa Hodgson, landlord of the Green Man pub in Denham, near Uxbridge, was initially told by her supplier SSE that it could not give her a quote for energy because prices were increasing so fast. \u201cWhen I did pin them down, they said before we can go any further, we want \u00a310,000 deposit,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cWhen I asked why, because they\u2019ve never had an issue with me, they said: \u2018We don\u2019t think a lot of pubs are going to make it this year and we need security.\u2019\u201d \u201cThere were other suppliers who just wouldn\u2019t entertain it at all because it\u2019s hospitality,\u201d Here\u2019s the full story, by my colleagues Rob Davies and Joanna Partridge: Energy firms refusing to supply small UK businesses over bankruptcy fears Read more\n\n\n\n3d ago 14.07 Rupert Jones Back in the UK, \u201cBills included\u201d has become the most popular search term for people looking online for a place to rent, according to data that highlights how alarmed many tenants are about the prospect of a big rise in energy costs.

That\u2019s less than forecast, with the previous week\u2019s reading revised down too (to 245,000 from 250,000).

US GDP fell at an annualised rate of 0.6% in April-June, not the 0.9% drop first estimated. The improvement is due to upward revisions to consumer spending and private inventory investment that were partly offset by a downward revision to residential fixed investment.

The minutes, released this lunchtime, also show that the decision to raise rates by a hefty 50 basis points (not just 25bp) was broadly supported. ING have picked out some highlights: Concerns about the weak euro came on top of the policy-relevant discussion, with \u201cMembers widely noted that the depreciation of the euro constituted an important change in the external environment and implied greater inflationary pressures for the euro area...\u201d\n\n\n\nRecession is still a forbidden word in the ECB\u2019s dictionary as it was only used nine times.

The price index for agricultural inputs leapt by 33.1% in the year to June, government data shows, led by fertilisers and soil improvers which more than doubled (+128%), energy and lubricants (+66%) and animal food (up around 33%). This forced farmers to lift their own prices by around 25% year-on-year, with the output value of oats soaring by 88%, wheat up 54%, rapeseed up 66% and milk by 41% in the year to June. UK agricultural input and output costs Photograph: UK government This is even before the closure of ammonia production by CF Fertilisers raises fresh worries about rising costs, and even potential livestock culls. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains: Farmers may once again face the difficult decision of having to cull animals if a backlog builds up for abattoirs and if a solution to the looming CO2 shortage isn\u2019t found quickly. Farms have been trying to absorb the eye-watering rise in costs, by finding new ways of working. Although input costs rose by 33.1% the value of agricultural output rose by 24.9% in the year to June. This still represents a horrible rise in prices which has been feeding through to our grocery bills. The value of some agricultural products have soared much higher than the headline rate such as oats, up 88%, oilseed rape up 66% and milk up 41% in the year to June, and only forage plants saw a reduction in output value. Although the rise in farmers input costs have been slowing down a little, they are still on an upwards trajectory and this latest fertiliser production crisis will add fresh impetus to the storm they are facing.\n\nUpdated at 13.36 BST\n\n3d ago 12.55 A shortages of carbon dioxide could leave farmers unable to send animals for processing for food, creating a \u2018serious animal welfare risk\u2019, Farmers Guardian reports. Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association, explained: We knew back in June that the closure of CF Industries\u2019 Cheshire plant would leave UK CO2 supplies vulnerable to anything going wrong with their remaining Billingham plant and that we would be heavily reliant on overseas suppliers to make up the shortfall. Since then, ammonia producers in Italy and Germany have cut production which sent European food and drink companies scrambling to secure tightening supplies of the gas at the end of July. Whilst we are in a much better position now than we were a year ago, if CF Industries follows through on its threat to close Billingham the British meat industry will have serious concerns. Without sufficient CO2 supplies the UK will potentially face an animal welfare issue with a mounting number of pigs and poultry unable to be sent for processing.

Average selling price inflation in the year to August sped up to its fastest pace since 1985, the CBI\u2019s latest industrial tends report shows. Firms are expecting to rise at a similarly quick rate in September too, adding to the inflationary pressures hitting shoppers.

Martin Sartorius, principal economist at the CBI, says the sector needs more support: While retail sales returned to solid growth in the year to August, firms remain pessimistic about their business situation over the next three months \u2013 to the greatest extent since the first Covid-19 lockdown in 2020. This gloom is reflected in retailers\u2019 investment intentions, which continue to be resolutely negative. Firms now need support from the government in order to encourage investment and create sustainable growth. Crucially, business rates reform and a more flexible apprenticeship levy will help with dwindling business confidence. However, sentiment amongst retailers remained gloomy, with firms feeling pessimistic about the business situation over the next three months to the greatest extent since the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in May 2020 #DTS pic.twitter.com/Xlf9gVb8je \u2014 CBI Economics (@CBI_Economics) August 25, 2022 Retailers plan to cut back on investment in the next 12 months compared to the previous 12 #DTS pic.twitter.com/5gTUuQuAIR \u2014 CBI Economics (@CBI_Economics) August 25, 2022\n\nUpdated at 13.42 BST\n\n3d ago 11.56 Full story: CO2 producers urged to meet UK food needs after halt in production Kalyeena Makortoff The government has urged CO 2 producers \u201cto do everything they can\u201d to meet food and drink industry demand, after one of the UK\u2019s largest suppliers confirmed it was going to pause production at a key factory. CF Industries, which accounts for 60% of the UK\u2019s CO 2 supplies, said soaring energy prices meant it would have to \u201ctemporarily halt\u201d production at its remaining UK ammonia plant, which creates the gas as a byproduct. The plant in Billingham, Teesside, is essential to industries ranging from beer to meat to fizzy drinks. CF Industries said the shutdown was the result of tough market conditions, noting that current prices for natural gas used in the process were \u201cuneconomical\u201d after rising to twice the level they were a year ago. It expects prices to continue rising in the months ahead. CO2 producers urged to meet UK food needs after halt in production Read more\n\n",

                "text": "Farmers harvest a wheat field near Melitopol in Ukraine. Wheat, soybean, sugar, and corn futures have fallen from their March highs back to prices seen at the start of 2022. Olga Maltseva | Afp | Getty Images\n\nFood prices dropped significantly in July from the previous month, particularly the costs of wheat and vegetable oil, according to the latest figures from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. But the FAO said that while the drop in food prices \"from very high levels\" is \"welcome,\" there are doubts over whether the good news will last. \"Many uncertainties remain, including high fertilizer prices that can impact future production prospects and farmers' livelihoods, a bleak global economic outlook, and currency movements, all of which pose serious strains for global food security,\" FAO chief economist Maximo Torero said in a press release. The FAO food price index, which tracks the monthly change in the global prices of a basket of food commodities, fell 8.6% in July from the month before. In June, the index fell just 2.3% month on month. However, the index in July was still 13.1% higher than July 2021.\n\nPrices in the short term may fall further, if futures are anything to go by. Wheat, soybean, sugar, and corn futures have fallen from their March highs back to prices seen at the start of 2022. For example, the wheat contracts closed at $775.75 per bushel on Friday, down from a 12-year high of $1,294 in March, and around the $758 price set in January.\n\nWhy prices fell\n\nAnalysts cited a mix of both demand and supply reasons for the slide in food prices: Ukraine and Russia's closely watched agreement to resume exports of grain through the Black Sea after months of blockade; better-than-expected crop harvests; a global economic slowdown; and the strong U.S. dollar. Rob Vos, the director of markets, trade and institutions at the International Food Policy Research Institute, pointed to the news that the United States and Australia are set to deliver bumper wheat harvests this year, which will improve supply since shipment from Ukraine and Russia have been curtailed. The higher U.S. dollar also lowers the price of staples, since commodities are priced in U.S. dollars, Vos said. Traders tend to ask for lower nominal dollar prices of commodities when the greenback is expensive.\n\nThe widely heralded U.N.-backed deal between Ukraine and Russia also helped to cool the market. Ukraine was the world's sixth-biggest wheat exporter in 2021, accounting for 10% of global wheat market share, according to the United Nations. The first shipment of Ukrainian grain \u2014 26,000 tons of maize \u2014 since the invasion left the country's southwestern port of Odesa last Monday.\n\nSkepticism over Ukraine-Russia deal\n\nGlobal skepticism over whether Russia will keep its end of the bargain hangs in the air. Russia fired a missile onto Odesa just hours after the U.N.-brokered deal in late-July. And freight and insurance companies may still think it's too risky to ship grain out of a war zone, Vos said, adding that food prices remain volatile and any new shock can cause more price surges. \"To make a difference it will not be enough to get a few shipments out, but at least 30 or 40 per month to get the existing grains stored in Ukraine out, as well as the produce of the upcoming harvest,\" said Vos. \"To help stabilize markets, the deal will need to hold in full also during the second half of the year since that is the period where Ukraine does most of its exports.\"\n\nEven with the existing agreement, arable Ukrainian land may continue to be destroyed \"for as long as the war continues,\" which will result in even less crop yield next year, Carlos Mera, the head of agri commodities market research at Rabobank, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Europe\" last week. \"Once this [grain] corridor is over, we might see even more price increases going forward,\" Mera said. Consumers could also see further price increases as there is normally a lag of three to nine months before a movement in commodity prices is reflected on supermarket shelves. Then there is the pressure of exporting enough grain as quickly as possible from a war zone. \"It's time that we're working again. I don't see us exporting two [to] five million tons per month out of these Black Sea ports,\" John Rich, the executive chairman of Ukrainian poultry giant Myronivsky Hliboproduct (MHP), told CNBC's \"Capital Connection\" on Monday. \"Hungry people, at the end of the day, get hungry very quickly after a week.\" In a note published earlier this month, credit rating agency Fitch Ratings' analysts wrote that a possible increase in fertilizer prices, which fell recently \u2014 but which are still double that of 2020 \u2014 could cause grain prices to jump again. Russia's restriction of gas supply has led European natural gas prices to spike. Natural gas is a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers. La Nina weather patterns could disrupt grain harvests later this year as well, they added.\n\nAnd the fall in food prices is not all good news. Part of the reason why staples have become cheaper is that traders and investors are pricing in recessionary fears, the analysts said. The global manufacturing purchasing managers' index has been in decline, while the U.S. Federal Reserve seems bent on raising interest rates to curb inflation even if it triggers a recession, the Fitch team wrote.\n\nFood staples",

                "text": "Which types of debt qualify?\n\nOnly federal student loan debt is eligible. Private loans are not eligible.\n\nAre my F.F.E.L. loans eligible for forgiveness?\n\nProbably, or at least eventually. If your F.F.E.L. loans, or Federal Family Education Loans, were eligible for the payment pause that began in 2020, they are already eligible for this new cancellation offering. If they were not eligible for the pause, then they\u2019re not eligible for cancellation right now.\n\nBut you will likely be able to make them eligible in one of two ways. First, you can consolidate them into a federal direct loan. At that point, they will be eligible. You can still consolidate now; the June 30 deadline we mentioned above does not apply here.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the second way. The Department of Education is working with the outside entities that oversee the cancellation-ineligible F.F.E.L. loans, with the intention of making cancellation available for the borrowers who have those loans. The department encourages people who may not want to consolidate to \u201csit tight\u201d and await word on this effort.\n\nI was a student this year. Do I qualify?\n\nYes. But if you were a dependent during the 2021-22 school year (and it\u2019s the Department of Education\u2019s definition of the term \u201cdependent\u201d that governs here, not the definition for federal tax purposes), eligibility depends on parental income, not your own.\n\nIf your status changed in the middle of this year \u2014 say, because you graduated \u2014 the department has administrative data for many people that will allow it to recognize the change. If it doesn\u2019t have that data, there will be a process by which you can prove your change in status.\n\nAre parent loans eligible?\n\nYes. The federal parent PLUS loans are eligible.\n\nAre graduate student loans eligible?\n\nYes. PLUS loans are also available for graduate students, and these, too, are eligible.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nThe consumer outlook for inflation decreased significantly in July amid a sharp drop in gas prices and a growing belief that the rapid surges in food and housing also would ebb in the future. The New York Federal Reserve's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations showed that respondents expect inflation to run at a 6.2% pace over the next year and a 3.2% rate for the next three years. While those numbers are still very high by historical standards, they mark a big drop-off from the respective 6.8% and 3.6% results from the June survey. Through June, food prices rose 10.4% over the past year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They are still expected to climb 6.7% over the next 12 months, but that's a decline from the June survey of 2.5 percentage points, the biggest fall in a data series going back to June 2013.\n\nLikewise, respondents see gas prices, which rose 60% over the past year, increasing at just a 1.5% pace over the next year, a slide of 4.2 percentage points from June, the second-biggest monthly decline in the survey's history. The price of regular gas has come down about 67 cents a gallon over the past month though it remains 87 cents higher than a year ago, according to AAA. Commodity prices overall have been falling significantly as well. Finally, home prices are expected to rise 3.5% from June's 4.4%, the lowest projected gain since November 2020. Five-year inflation expectations also slipped, dropping 0.5 percentage point to 2.3%.\n\nThe results come as the Fed has been raising interest rates aggressively to bring down inflation running at its highest level in more than 40 years. The central bank in 2022 has hiked benchmark rates four times for a total of 2.25 percentage points, and market pricing indicates a third consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase in September, according to CME Group data. However, the New York Fed results from July might give policymakers reason to pull back if not in September then later in the year if the inflation data cooperates. The Fed targets inflation at 2% over the long run, so the projected levels in the survey remain well above the central bank's comfort level. Over the weekend, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said she doesn't expect inflation to come down anytime soon and sees a need to keep pushing rates higher. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly echoed those sentiments, saying the increases are \"far from done.\" Those comments came after the BLS on Friday reported much higher numbers for payroll growth \u2014 528,000 \u2014 and wages, with average hourly earnings jumping 5.2%.",

                "text": "Sony is increasing the price of the PlayStation 5 by as much as 20%, the company says, in every major market save the US.\n\nThe UK price of the games console, which has been plagued by supply shortages since its release in November 2020, will increase by 6% (\u00a330), from \u00a3449.99 to \u00a3479.99. A cheaper, disc-less version of the console will get the same price rise, from \u00a3359.99 to \u00a3389.99.\n\nAustralian prices are increasing from AU$749.95 to AU$799.95, and from AU$599.95 to AU$649.95, respectively.\n\nThere are even larger increases in other markets. In Europe, a \u20ac50 price increase will take the console\u2019s price up 10% to \u20ac549.99 (\u00a3467), while in Japan, a \u00a510,498 price rise, more than 20%, takes the console to \u00a560,478 (\u00a3373.74).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing high global inflation rates, as well as adverse currency trends, impacting consumers and creating pressure on many industries,\u201d said Jim Ryan, the president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, in a blogpost explaining the price rise. \u201cBased on these challenging economic conditions, SIE has made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price (RRP) of PlayStation 5 in select markets.\u201d\n\nThe continued short supply of PlayStation 5s means the price increase still represents a substantial saving on the open market value of the console. A new, sealed PS5 sells for more than \u00a3600 on eBay, feeding into further supply shortages as scalpers race to buy consoles at RRP whenever they are available.\n\nPrice rises for consumer electronics, even in a high-inflation environment, are rare. While prices often increase when new models are introduced, it is rare to see a price increase in the middle of a device\u2019s lifespan.\n\nBut Sony is not the first gaming company to react to inflationary pressure. In July, Facebook increased the price of its Meta Quest 2 VR headset by \u00a3100, an increase of 33%, citing the same inflationary pressures. \u201cBy adjusting the price of Quest 2, we can continue to grow our investment in groundbreaking research and new product development that pushes the VR industry to new heights,\u201d the company said in a statement.",

Gannet77 | Getty Images\n\nBritain's Post Office, which offers banking services as well as mail, handled a record \u00a3801 million ($967 million) in personal cash withdrawals in July. In total, more than \u00a33.3 billion in cash was withdrawn and deposited over the Post Office's counters \u2014 the first time the amount has crossed the \u00a33.3 billion threshold in its 360-year history. Personal cash withdrawals were up almost 8% month on month at \u00a3744 in June, and up over 20% from a year ago to \u00a3665 million in July.\n\nStaycations and budgeting\n\nThe spike in cash use is down to several factors. \"Firstly, more people use cash when they go on staycation, secondly, the Post Office helped to hand out support to energy customers in the form of cash, and thirdly, people are using it as a budgeting method,\" said Laura Suter, head of finance at AJ Bell. The Post Office research found that 71% of Brits planning to go on holiday in the U.K. this year intend to take out cash before doing so. Of those who have holidayed in the U.K. in the last five years, almost a third admitted to being caught out by not having cash on them. In July, the Post Office processed more than 600,000 cash payouts for people eligible for energy bill support from the British government. That came to around \u00a390 million and allowed people to pay energy bills, top up gas and electricity meters or use cash for easier budgeting. In total, \u00a33.31 billion in cash deposits and withdrawals were processed at the Post Office in July, \u00a3100 million higher than in June. The data comes as the country continues to grapple with rising inflation. The Bank of England expects headline inflation to peak at 13.3% in October and to remain at elevated levels throughout much of 2023.\n\nIs it here to stay?",

                "text": "The founder of Huawei has delivered a stark warning for the tech company\u2019s future, sparking alarm with the frankness of his assessment and what it signals for smaller businesses amid China\u2019s economic troubles and a global downturn.\n\nIn a leaked internal memo, Ren Zhengfei told Huawei staff \u201cthe chill will be felt by everyone\u201d and the company must focus on profit over cashflow and expansion if it is to survive the next three years, indicating further job cuts and divestments.\n\n\u201cThe next decade will be a very painful historical period, as the global economy continues to decline,\u201d Ren said, pointing to the pandemic as well as the impact of the Ukraine war and a \u201ccontinued blockade\u201d by the US on some Chinese business.\n\n\u201cHuawei must reduce any overly optimistic expectations for the future and until 2023 or even 2025, we must make survival the most important guideline, and not only survive but survive with quality.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s economy is under pressure from factors including pandemic restrictions, a property industry crisis and plummeting international relations. The country is not expected to reach its economic growth target of 5.5% this year.\n\nHuawei, routinely listed as China\u2019s largest firm, is working to manage big falls in revenue and profit. Revenue declined 14% in the first three months of 2022 and its net profit margin narrowed to 4.3%, from 11.1% a year earlier, in the three months through March.\n\nIt has been a flashpoint of US-China tensions, with Washington and other western counterparts restricting Huawei from their markets over national security concerns. The company has also been barred from buying some foreign technology.\n\n\u201cIn the past, we embraced the ideal of globalisation and aspired to serve all mankind, so what is our ideal now?\u201d wrote Ren.\n\n\u201cSurvive and earn a little money where we can. From this point of view, we need to adjust the market structure and study what can be done and what should be abandoned.\u201d\n\nRen\u2019s memo went viral on Chinese social media, shared and discussed by more than 100 million users, with some expressing fear of what it meant for regular people and small businesses if a company the size of Huawei was sending such warnings.\n\n\u201cThe last person who said such things was Vanke\u2019s Wang Shi and then real estate was in danger,\u201d said one commenter, referring to the chief executive of a state-run property development company.\n\nSeveral blamed the US, with one commenter saying Huawei\u2019s expansion \u201ccame to an abrupt end under the frenzied suppression of the United States\u201d.\n\nLinghao Bao, an analyst at Trivium China, said the global economy was in bad shape and it was not unusual to be cutting costs in a recession. \u201cThe reason why Ren Zhengfei\u2019s words stood out is the way he said it. He sounded like he was in panic mode,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, it\u2019s a politically sensitive time right now. We\u2019re just a couple of months away from the 20th party congress. As you know, economic performance is tied up with the party\u2019s legitimacy.\u201d\n\nProfessor Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute, said Ren enjoyed a status that might allow him to speak more freely than others, and should be taken seriously.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The questions are whether Xi will have the pragmatism and vision of Ren to come up with something that may be as effective as what Ren is putting forth for Huawei.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s government this week announced a further $146bn (\u00a3123bn) in stimulus funding and 19 new measures to address the economic damage wrought by the pandemic and the country\u2019s hardline responses, as well as a crisis in the property development industry.\n\nExtensive and unpredictable lockdowns have disrupted factory production, supply chains and general economic activity, particularly among small businesses. The private sector provides a third of all jobs in China and creates 90% of new urban jobs, according to state media.\n\nYouth unemployment reached an all-time high of 19.9% in July and the general urban jobless rate remained at a relatively high rate of 5.4%. Unemployment insurance payouts also hit a record high in June.\n\n\u201cAmid sporadic Covid-19 outbreaks in some regions since the beginning of this year, job demand in the market has reduced and some recruitment campaigns have been cancelled or delayed,\u201d Zhang Ying, the director of employment promotion at the ministry of human resources and social security, said at a news conference on Thursday.\n\n\u201cSome young job hunters have encountered new difficulties.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Xiaoqian Zhu and agencies",

                "text": "Take a look at some of the biggest movers in the premarket:\n\nZoom Video Communications (ZM) \u2013 Zoom tumbled 11.5% in the premarket after the videoconferencing company cut its full-year forecast. Zoom reported better-than-expected earnings for its latest quarter, but revenue fell short of forecasts. Zoom's CFO said the company is having some difficulty attracting new, paying subscribers, although he added that enterprise sales are strong.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) \u2013 Palo Alto rallied 9.3% in premarket trading after the cybersecurity company reported better-than-expected quarterly results and issued an upbeat forecast. Palo Alto also announced its board of directors had approved a 3-for-1 stock split.\n\nMacy's (M) \u2013 The retailer's shares added 2.5% in premarket trading after it beat sales and profit forecasts for its second quarter, and comparable store sales fell less than expected. Macy's lowered full-year guidance, however, to incorporate risks from a slowing economy.\n\nDick's Sporting Goods (DKS) \u2013 The sporting goods retailer beat top and bottom line estimates for the second quarter and raised its full-year forecast. Comparable store sales sank by 5.1% during the quarter, but that was smaller than the 6.9% decline expected by analysts. The stock gained 2.3% in the premarket.\n\nMedtronic (MDT) \u2013 Medtronic gained 1% in the premarket after reporting quarterly profit and revenue that exceeded analysts' forecasts. Revenue fell from a year ago as the medical products maker was impacted by supply chain challenges.\n\nJD.com (JD) \u2013 The China-based e-commerce company reported better-than-expected quarterly results and saw a 9.2% increase in active customer accounts. JD.com jumped 4.3% in premarket action.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) \u2013 Nearly 10 million viewers watched the \"Game of Thrones\" prequel \"House of the Dragon\" on the company's HBO Max service, a record for an HBO series debut. Warner Bros. Discovery gained 1.4% in the premarket.\n\nJ.M. Smucker (SJM) \u2013 The food producer's stock added 1.8% in premarket trading after it reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year outlook.\n\nXPeng (XPEV) \u2013 XPeng fell 4.9% in premarket action after the China-based electric vehicle maker reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss, although revenue exceeded analysts' forecasts as total deliveries nearly doubled from a year earlier.\n\nPinduoduo (PDD) \u2013 Pinduoduo plans to launch an international e-commerce platform next month, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke to Reuters. Pinduoduo rose 2.6% in premarket trading.",

                "text": "Last week, Mr. Biden signed into law a vast economic package that his administration says will help reduce inflation. It includes tax credits to stoke low-carbon energy, expanded premium supports for Americans who buy health insurance through the federal government and curbs on prescription drug prices for seniors.\n\nBut the president was forced to drop his push to extend many of the temporary programs that Democrats approved last year to directly fight hunger and poverty. That included additional food from the Agriculture Department, rental assistance from the Treasury, and supplemental income in the form of direct payments and an expanded child tax credit. An extension of the child credit was included in a bill carrying a much larger portion of Mr. Biden\u2019s agenda that the House passed in November, but it did not survive in the Senate. An earlier Biden proposal had also contained $150 billion in affordable-housing programs, which were also jettisoned.\n\nThe swift decline into pandemic recession plunged millions of Americans into dire financial straits. In 2020, the Oregon Food Bank served 1.7 million people, Ms. Morgan said. That number dipped in 2021 to about 1.2 million.\n\nNow it\u2019s rising again, toward what Ms. Morgan estimates could be 1.5 million. That would be the food bank\u2019s second-largest caseload for a single year, behind only 2020.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very direct correlation between federal assistance, state assistance and a decrease in numbers,\u201d said Kevin Ryan, the director of social services at William Temple House, who welcomed Ms. Smith, Ms. Clover and others to a shaded sitting area where they waited for their trip into the food pantry to begin.\n\n\u201cWhen that goes away, the numbers go back up.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Biden\u2019s team drafted the rescue plan in the early days of his administration, it was trying to give vulnerable Americans, particularly those thrown out of work or at risk of losing their homes, enough assistance to carry them through until the economy returned to some version of normal.",

                "text": "Physical and financial harm will be caused to millions of vulnerable families unless the government takes action to avert a winter catastrophe by cutting energy bills, leading economists have warned.\n\nIn the run-up to the announcement of the new energy price cap tomorrow the Resolution Foundation thinktank said radical policies such as price freezes, solidarity taxes or lower social tariffs were needed to prevent the cost of living crisis worsening.\n\nPressure on the government to act also came from disability charities and the business lobby group, the British Chambers of Commerce, which warned of widespread company failures without Covid-style emergency support.\n\nThe BCC said time was running out as it outlined a five-point plan to soften the impact of rising energy costs.\n\nThe calls came as the energy regulator Ofgem is preparing to reveal a new price cap for October that is likely to rise from just under \u00a32,000 a year to more than \u00a33,500 a year. The cap was at \u00a31,277 last October, meaning bills will have more than doubled in a year.\n\nLabour said neither Liz Truss nor Rishi Sunak had come up with serious proposals, after the rivals to succeed Boris Johnson as prime minister rejected calls by the head of Scottish Power for a two-year freeze on energy bills costing \u00a3100bn.\n\nSunak said he was \u201cnervous and sceptical\u201d about the plan, while a government source close to the Truss campaign said the proposal was \u201cirrelevant\u201d because both candidates had ruled out a price freeze.\n\nFamilies caring for a child or adult with disabilities have been left \u201cfrustrated\u201d by the cost of living crisis, with more than 70% having been plunged into debt, according to research for the national disability charity Sense. Four in five (83%) disabled households said the government was not doing enough to help.\n\nThe Resolution Foundation said Truss\u2019s tax-cutting plan \u201ccompletely misses the target\u201d, while Sunak\u2019s plan failed to help struggling working families outside the benefits system. The thinktank said: \u201cTypical energy bills will cost around \u00a32,000 more this year than last year \u2013 money that many families simply don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nIt called for a new social tariff under which people claiming benefits or where no one in the household earned more than \u00a325,000 would receive a 30% bill reduction.\n\nAlternatively, the Resolution Foundation said the government could announce a universal cut in bills partly offset by a solidarity tax \u2013 a 1% increase in income tax that would fall most heavily on those on higher incomes.\n\nJonny Marshall, a senior economist at Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cA catastrophe is coming this winter as soaring energy bills risk causing serious physical and financial damage to families across Britain. We are on course for thousands to see their energy cut off entirely, while millions will be unable to pay bills and build up unmanageable arrears.\n\n\u201cThe new prime minister will need to think the unthinkable in terms of the policies needed to get sufficient support to where it\u2019s needed most.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But none of the proposals from the leadership candidates or the opposition parties currently do this.\n\n\u201cAn innovative social tariff could provide broader targeted support but involves huge delivery challenges, while freezing the price cap gives too much away to those least in need. This problem could be overcome with a solidarity tax on high earners \u2013 an unthinkable policy in the context of the leadership debates but a practical solution to the reality facing families this winter.\u201d\n\nShevaun Haviland, the director general of the BCC, said she had written to Johnson, Nadhim Zahawi, the chancellor of the exchequer and both Truss and Sunak expressing concern for businesses and households.\n\n\u201cToday I have written to the prime minister, chancellor of the exchequer and both Conservative party leadership candidates expressing my concern for businesses and households during these challenging times.\n\n\u201cAt over 10%, CPI inflation is at a 40-year high, interest rates are seeing the largest increase in 27 years and eye-watering energy bills have created a perfect storm of increasing costs. The impact of these challenges on consumers, businesses and wider society cannot be overstated.\u201d\n\nThe BCC said firms could not afford to wait another month without practical support measures being put in place as it called for a temporary cut in VAT for businesses from 20% to 5%, the same rate paid by domestic users, a Covid-style government emergency energy grant to subsidise costs for small and medium-sized enterprises and a temporary reversal of the increase in national insurance contributions.\n\nAcross the UK, hundreds of small traders are closing their doors, as energy contracts expire and they are quoted unaffordable rates for new energy deals. The Federation of Small Businesses has warned of a \u201clost generation\u201d of entrepreneurs unless ministers step in with immediate help.",

                "text": "Morgan Stanley is betting on a few Chinese stocks \u2014 such as technology and materials companies \u2014 to ride out what's expected to be a period of high market volatility. The investment firm prefers mainland China stocks to those listed offshore, equity strategist Laura Wang said in an Aug. 15 report about the bank's positioning in Chinese equities in the third quarter. Mainland China's CSI 300 index has outperformed the MSCI China stock index by 20 percentage points since mid-November, she said. MSCI China's top holdings are Chinese stocks listed mostly in Hong Kong, such as Tencent and Alibaba . Wang noted how the MSCI China index is most sensitive to sectors affected by regulatory uncertainty, and is experiencing its longest bear market in its 20-year history. She expects the property market slump , downward earnings revisions, potential Covid outbreaks and uncertainty around U.S.-China tensions to likely keep market volatility elevated. In the interim, she said the firm recommends remaining overweight on materials companies. \"We also like information technology, which enjoys a continuous policy tailwind, and Utilities for defensiveness,\" Wang said. For each of those three sectors, CNBC selected the stock on the bank's China/Hong Kong focus list with the greatest potential upside to undisclosed price targets as of Aug. 11, per Morgan Stanley's analysts. All three are rated overweight by the investment bank. Technology: Glodon Potential upside: 59.8% Glodon is a construction software company with products that include building design and cost estimation tools. The company claimed net profit attributable to shareholders doubled last year to 661 million yuan ($97.3 million). The Shenzhen-traded shares are down by more than 10% over the last six months, but have posted gains over the last three months. Materials: Ganfeng Lithium Potential upside: 58.8% Ganfeng Lithium is a giant supplier of lithium for electric car batteries. The company said its net profit attributable to shareholders soared by 410% last year to 5.23 billion yuan ($770.21 million). However, the stock plunged this year. The company's Hong Kong-listed shares are down by about 24% over the last three months. Ganfeng and Glodon have both outperformed the MSCI China Index since Morgan Stanley added them to their focus list, according to the bank's report. Utilities: Kunlun Energy Potential upside: 47.3% Kunlun Energy focuses on natural gas processing and transport. The company is controlled by state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation. Kunlun said its profit attributable to shareholders surged by nearly 280% to 23.02 billion yuan last year. The company's Hong Kong-traded shares are down by about 12% over the last three months. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

                "text": "America\u2019s students have a debt problem. A big one. More than 45 million Americans \u2013 more than the population of California \u2013 now owe a collective $1.7tn in student debt.\n\nThe vast majority of the money is owed to the federal government, which has been backing or directly offering student loans for higher education since 1958. While student loans are not new in the United States, the amount of student debt has more than tripled over the last 16 years.\n\nFor the first time in history, the federal government will cancel a large swath of student debt to address the crisis. On Wednesday, Joe Biden announced borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year will see $10,000 shaved off their debt. Most borrowers will qualify for some cancellation. For at least 15 million, that means complete erasure of their debt.\n\nStudent debt will remain a hot political issue. Understanding the impact of such a dramatic policy requires unpacking the student debt crisis, beginning with its origins.\n\nHow the student debt crisis started\n\nIn 1957 the Soviet Union successfully launching the first earth-orbiting satellite, Sputnik. With the cold war raging the federal government feared the US education system was failing to produce enough scientists and engineers to compete with the Soviets and, in 1958, started handing out student loans through the National Defense Education Act.\n\nNearly a decade later, the Higher Education Act of 1965 allowed more people to take out loans as the federal government promised to pay back banks for any loans that were not repaid.\n\n\u201cIt all started from this choice, which I think was a terrible choice, to decide that as a policy matter we should support higher education \u2026 by giving [students] an opportunity to get a loan,\u201d said Dali\u00e9 Jimenez, professor of law and director of the Student Loan Law Initiative at the University of California at Irvine. \u201cIt was just a terrible mistake.\u201d\n\nStarting in 2010, the federal government started directly lending money to student borrowers. In the wake of the Great Recession, the amount of student debt began to increase rapidly. Colleges were seeing increased enrollment as people left the workforce to go back to school. States slashed their higher education budgets, leading to higher tuition. More students were turning to for-profit colleges, which tend to be more expensive than public colleges.\n\nOver the last few years, the amount of grant aid, which does not need to be paid back, has risen. Yet despite this appearance of more financial support for students to attend college, the cost of attendance has remained the same.\n\nThe cost of attending public college has actually increased at a higher rate than the cost to attend a private college. The net cost of attendance for four-year public colleges, which takes into account any grants students receive, went from $17,500 in 2006 to $20,210 in 2016, according to data from College Board.\n\n\u201cThat era 10 years ago was a really formative moment for producing a lot of debt that\u2019s still out there,\u201d said Kevin Miller, associate director for higher education at the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s Economic Policy Project. \u201cThe cost of college attendance has gone up a lot while household incomes in the United States haven\u2019t \u2026 there\u2019s a real sense that if grant, state or institutional aid isn\u2019t filling the gap, that just leaves debt as the only option.\u201d\n\nWhat student debt looks like today\n\nFor the 2021-2022 school year, the average cost of tuition and fees for a four-year public college is $10,740. The cost is nearly quadrupled for private institutions, at an average of $38,070. Even with grant aid, the cost of attendance is an average of $19,230 for public institutions and $32,720 at private schools.\n\nEstimates put the average debt of those in the class of 2019 who took out student loans at $28,950. The number is close to the maximum $31,000 that students who are dependents of parents or guardians can borrow from the federal government to fund undergraduate education.\n\nContinuing racial wealth disparities are reflected in who has to take out loans to fund college. About half of Black college students take out student loans, compared with 40% of white students. Black Americans owe an average of $25,000 more in debt than their white counterparts and are more likely to be behind on their payments.\n\nDespite the amount of debt many students need to take on to attend college, nearly 20 million Americans still enroll in college every year. While earnings can depend on a person\u2019s industry, those with a bachelor\u2019s degrees earn 75% more in their lifetime than those with just a high school diploma.\n\n\u201cThe message is you have to get a college degree. It\u2019s not just a rhetorical message, it\u2019s an actual truth that if you don\u2019t have a college degree, particularly if you are Black or brown \u2026 you will not be able to get a job that is better than your parents\u2019,\u201d Jimenez said.\n\nThose with graduate and professional degrees earn even more, but the price for an advanced degree is even higher. A good chunk of student debt \u2013 about 40% \u2013 is held by those who took out loans to pay for graduate school.\n\nWhat the government has done to address student debt\n\nAfter over a year of deliberation, the White House announced on Wednesday the largest student debt cancellation in US history. Federal borrowers making under $125,000 will see $10,000 of their debt forgiven. The policy represents a fulfillment of a promise Biden made on the campaign trail to cancel $10,000 of student debt.\n\nUntil Wednesday, the most substantial policy addressing student debt was first implemented by the Trump administration, which paused student loan payments and interest accrual at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Both Trump and Biden extended the pause over the last two years, and it is now set to expire on 31 August.\n\nSince the beginning of this year, Biden has announced a slate of additional policies alongside the pause extension. Those who have defaulted or are delinquent on their federal student loans will be returned to good standing. Biden forgave $415m in student debt for borrowers who attended predatory for-profit schools.\n\nHis administration also announced changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which forgives the student loans of borrowers who are non-profit and government employees after 10 years of debt or after 120 payments are made. Over 113,000 borrowers with a cumulative $6.8bn in debt are now eligible for forgiveness. Over the years, the program has been under much criticism, as relief through the program was rare and borrowers were often deemed not qualified for logistical reasons.\n\nThe debate over debt forgiveness\n\nRepublicans have been using student debt as a talking point against Biden as the midterm elections approach.\n\nSenator Mitt Romney suggested that Democrats canceling student loans is a way of bribing voters. \u201cOther bribe suggestions: Forgive auto loans? Forgive credit card debt? Forgive mortgages?\u201d he wrote on Twitter. JD Vance (who went to Yale Law School) told the Washington Post that \u201cBiden essentially wants blue-collar workers like truck drivers \u2013 who didn\u2019t have the luxury of going to college to get drunk for four years \u2013 to bail out a bunch of upper-middle-class kids.\u201d\n\nThe reality is that the student loans of those in the highest income quartile \u2013 people making more than $97,000 \u2013 do make up a third of all outstanding student debt. But many low-income Americans also have student debt, though the amount of debt they have is smaller. Those making below $27,000 a year make up 17% of all borrowers, but their loans comprise 12% of all the outstanding debt.\n\nAn income threshold could be a way for the government to target forgiveness to those who need it most. But some have pointed out that an income ceiling does not take into consideration a person\u2019s wealth.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at a snapshot of what your income was this year or last year, that tells you very little,\u201d Jimenez said. \u201cIf your family has no wealth, you\u2019re very differently situated from someone who has family wealth or personal wealth from previous careers.\u201d\n\nThose who have been advocating for student debt cancellation say that $10,000 in forgiveness will not be enough to address the breadth of the crisis. Democratic lawmakers, including Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have called on Biden to cancel up to $50,000.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in a cutoff, especially for so many of the frontline workers who are drowning in debt and would likely be excluded from relief,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told the Washington Post. \u201cCanceling $50,000 in debt is where you really make a dent in inequality and the racial gap. $10,000 isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nEnding the student debt crisis for good\n\nEven though millions will now see debt cancellation, future college students will continue to take out loans \u2013 and at higher interest rates. Tackling the price tag of college will come with its own complications, but advocates say it will be necessary to ensure student debt does not get worse.\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s plan for free community college was killed along with the rest of the social and climate spending bill that was making its way through Congress, some efforts for better college funding are happening at the local level.\n\nIn March, the governor of New Mexico signed a bill that would use $75m in state funds to cover tuition and fees for undergraduate students at two- and four-year colleges. Drives for similar government support have been seen in Pennsylvania, California and Maine.\n\n\u201cThe cost of college is too high for a lot of students to manage without debt. Making it so that students can go without debt or take less debt in the first place is the thing that we really need to be focusing on,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWhat about the next generation or the one after that?\u201d",

                "text": "Check out the companies making the biggest moves midday Monday:\n\nAMC \u2014 Shares of the theater chain dropped nearly 42% as investors weighed the company's new preferred share class and news that rival Cineworld was considering bankruptcy. AMC's new APE units were trading at roughly $7.50 per share, offsetting the large losses for the common stock.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond, GameStop \u2014 Other meme-stock favorites Bed Bath & Beyond and GameStop also dropped. Bed Bath & Beyond fell more than 16% as investors continued to react to news investor Ryan Cohen had sold his shares and a report that certain suppliers have halted shipments to the retailer because of unpaid bills. GameStop followed along, declining about 5%.\n\nSignify Health \u2014 Shares of the home health services provided jumped 32% after The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News reported that Amazon is among the bidders for the company. CVS and UnitedHealth are also reportedly making bids. Shares of Amazon dipped by 3%.\n\nNetflix \u2014 The streaming service dropped more than 6% following a CFRA downgrade of the stock to sell from hold. The firm also lowered its price target to $238 from $245, slightly lower than Friday's closing.\n\nFord \u2014 Ford shares sank 5% after a jury ruled against the automaker in a case involving a fatal crash that centered on roof strength in one of its older pickup trucks. The company has been ordered to pay $1.7 billion. Ford also announced Monday morning it is cutting about 3,000 jobs in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nTesla \u2014 Shares of Tesla dropped over 2% after CEO Elon Musk announced the electric-car maker would hike the price of its Full Self-Driving option by 25% in September. The cost will jump to $15,000 from $12,000.\n\nOccidental Petroleum \u2014 The energy stock retreated more than 3% in the broad market sell-off, following a 10% rally in the previous session. Occidental jumped double digits on Friday after news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway received regulatory approval to purchase up to 50% of the oil giant.\n\nDocuSign \u2014 Shares of electronic signature company tumbled 4.34% following a price target cut and downgrade from RBC to sector perform from outperform, as the company searches for a new CEO.\n\nVF Corp \u2014 Shares of Vans parent company VF Corp sank more than 5% Monday after Cowen downgraded the stock to market perform and cut its price target. The firm changed its rating, citing potential consumer weakness if there is a recession in the U.S. or abroad, and rising inventories at the retailer.\n\nTravel stocks \u2014 Travel stocks struggled along with the broader market. Cruise line stocks such as Carnival, Royal Caribbean Group and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings were lower by 4.86%, 4.72% and 4.78%, respectively. Airline companies United Airlines fell 3.04%, and Delta Air Lines dropped 2.62%. Wynn Resorts was down 4.98%.\n\nTech stocks \u2014 Shares of tech companies fell amid fear of more aggressive Federal Reserve rate hikes. Apple, Amazon and Alphabet dropped 2.3%, 3.62%, and 2.53%, respectively, while Salesforce sank more than 3%. Semiconductor stocks also took a hit, with Micron and Advanced Micro Devices down more than 3% each and Nvidia down more than 4%.\n\n\u2014CNBC's Samantha Subin, Yun Li, Jesse Pound, Carmen Reinicke and Sarah Min contributed reporting.",

                "text": "Taken together, the results show that the robust sales retailers grew accustomed to during the course of the pandemic have ceased \u2014 and the consumer landscape that awaits may be more austere than what they prepared for. (There were exceptions. Home Depot, for instance, said sales were still strong, driven by home improvement projects.) On earnings calls, executives said lower- to middle-income consumers were the most hesitant to spend. Stores are responding by pushing more discounts and highlighting private-label brand to shoppers, and, in some cases, canceling billions of dollars\u2019 worth of orders with vendors. It remains to be seen which strategies will be most effective.\n\nInflation F.A.Q. Card 1 of 5 Inflation F.A.Q. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. Inflation F.A.Q. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Inflation F.A.Q. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. Inflation F.A.Q. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Inflation F.A.Q. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe last two years was great for retailers because consumers were buying everything they had to offer,\u201d Liza Amlani, founder of Retail Strategy Group, which works with brands on their merchandising and planning strategies. \u201cThey just can\u2019t do that anymore. You have to understand what the consumer wants more now than ever.\u201d\n\nIn July, U.S. retail sales were virtually unchanged, according to data from the Commerce Department released Wednesday. Excluding the sales of gas and cars, retail sales actually increased 0.7 percent. But 85 percent of U.S. consumers said that inflation is altering the way they shop, according to a survey released this week from Morning Consult.\n\nMost retailers are hoping this pullback period is only temporary. In the meantime, companies are trying to signal to customers that it\u2019s worth doing what spending they do in their stores. Kohl\u2019s, for instance, said that its private-label brands outperformed the national ones it carries last quarter, and that shoppers gravitated toward buying more basic apparel that could be worn with many different outfits.",

Olivier Douliery | AFP | Getty Images\n\nYou'd be hard-pressed now to find a recession in the rearview mirror. What's down the road, though, is another story. There is no historical precedent to indicate that an economy in recession can produce 528,000 jobs in a month, as the U.S. did during July. A 3.5% unemployment rate, tied for the lowest since 1969, is not consistent with contraction. But that doesn't mean there isn't a recession ahead, and, ironically enough, it is the labor market's phenomenal resiliency that could pose the broader economy's biggest long-run danger. The Federal Reserve is trying to ease pressures on a historically tight jobs situation and its rapid wage gains in an effort to control inflation running at its highest level in more than 40 years.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is this gives the Fed additional room to continue to tighten, even if it raises the probability of pushing the economy into recession,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \"It's not going to be an easy task to continue to tighten without negative repercussions for the consumer and the economy.\" Indeed, following the robust job numbers, which included a 5.2% 12-month gain for average hourly earnings, traders accelerated their bets on a more aggressive Fed. As of Friday afternoon, markets were assigning about a 69% chance of the central bank enacting its third straight 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike when it meets again in September, according to CME Group data. So while President Joe Biden celebrated the big jobs number on Friday, a much more unpleasant data point could be on the way next week. The consumer price index, the most widely followed inflation measure, comes out Wednesday, and it's expected to show continued upward pressure even with a sharp drop in gasoline prices in July. That will complicate the central bank's balancing act of using rate increases to temper inflation without tipping the economy into recession. As Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at asset management giant BlackRock, said, the challenge is \"how to execute a 'soft landing' when the economy is coming in hot, and is landing on a runway it has never used before.\" \"Today's print, coming in much stronger than anticipated, complicates the job of a Federal Reserve that seeks to engineer a more temperate employment environment, in keeping with its attempts to moderate current levels of inflation,\" Rieder said in a client note. \"The question though now is how much longer (and higher) will rates have to go before inflation can be brought under control?\"\n\nMore recession signs\n\nFinancial markets were betting against the Fed in other ways. The 2-year Treasury note yield exceeded that of the 10-year note by the highest margin in about 22 years Friday afternoon. That phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, has been a telltale recession sign particularly when it goes on for an extended period of time. In the present case, the inversion has been in place since early July. But that doesn't mean a recession is imminent, only that one is likely over the next year or two. While that means the central bank has some time on its side, it also could mean it won't have the luxury of slow hikes but rather will have to continue to move quickly \u2014 a situation that policymakers had hoped to avoid. \"This is certainly not my base case, but I think that we may start to hear some chatter of an inter-meeting hike, but only if the next batch of inflation reports is hot,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.",

                "text": "From 4d ago 14.09 Levelling up bill does not include funding needed to make levelling up happen, say MPs Although the House of Commons is not sitting over the summer, MPs still have work to do and some who chair select committees have been sending out letters. Clive Betts, the Labour MP who chairs the levelling up committee, says that when Greg Clark replaced Michael Gove as levelling up secretary in July, he asked Betts to tell him over the summer what the committee thought of the levelling up and regeneration bill. Not much seems to be the answer. Today Betts has released the letter he has sent to Clark on behalf of his committee giving an assessment of the bill and here is the key paragraph. It is the committee\u2019s view that the main tool to achieve levelling up will be through appropriate funding to those areas that need it most. This funding will help in making progress on the levelling up missions related to public transport and local connectivity; transforming digital connectivity; improving education outcomes; increasing the number of adults who complete high quality skills training; and increasing healthy life expectancy. None of the provisions in the bill will directly contribute to making progress towards achieving these missions \u2013 other than setting them. There is also no funding for levelling up associated with the bill. Like all select committees, this one has a narrow Conservative majority. And in a statement to journalists Betts said: In its current form, the bill does little to reassure that levelling up will prove to be more than just a slogan and that we will have meaningful change in local communities across the country. In key areas, it is unclear how the government intends to drive change and they are yet to commit to the spending that is necessary to level up the country. Our inquiry has focused on the planning provisions in the bill, which can be described as loosely-connected proposals to tinker with the current system, hopefully achieving some improvement. It has been difficult to conduct scrutiny due to a lot of the detail of the provisions having not yet been published.\n\nUpdated at 17.50 BST\n\n4d ago 16.23 Covid-19 testing among NHS and care home staff with no symptoms in England is to be \u201cpaused\u201d at the end of August, the Department of Health and Social Care has announced. Officials said that the decision to stop all \u201casymptomatic testing\u201d comes as cases of the virus continue to fall. Asymptomatic testing will remain in place for people being admitted hospices and for those going into care homes and for immunocompromised patients who are being admitted to hospital, the DHSC says in its news release.\n\nUpdated at 16.25 BST\n\n4d ago 16.17 Civil service unions have written to the government calling for a cap on pay rises to be lifted in light of the cost of living crisis. In a joint letter to the Cabinet Office, Mike Clancy, the Prospect general secretary, and Dave Penman, the FDA general secretary, said: In the context of high and rising inflation, the 2-3% range set in the guidance is clearly not fit for purpose. The latest predictions suggest inflation could reach 18%, far beyond what was envisaged when the guidance was set for this year. In that context it is clear that cost of living pressures cannot in any way be meaningfully addressed for our members within an envelope of 2-3%. A refusal to recognise this across all grades in the service is both unacceptable and damaging. Clancy and Penman also said they were seeking an \u201curgent meeting\u201d with the Cabinet Office\u2019s permanent secretary to discuss pay.\n\nUpdated at 16.26 BST\n\n4d ago 16.13 Burnham backs Sarwar's call for metro mayors in Scotland Local champions are required across Scotland\u2019s communities in order to deliver important change, Scottish Labour has said. As PA Media reports, Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, made the call alongside Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor and former Labour MP, at the launch of a paper on local government reform in Glasgow. Sarwar suggested that Scotland could \u201clearn the lessons\u201d of the use of local and metro mayors elsewhere in the UK, and that by introducing such a system north of the border, communities would become more empowered. Burnham said introducing regional mayors in Scotland could make a \u201creal difference\u201d, adding that cities risked being left behind if they did not have enough power to do things for themselves. He said: As I look at things today, you know, it\u2019s obviously been good that Scotland\u2019s had devolution to the national level. But at the same time, I think cities potentially could get left behind if cities don\u2019t have more power to do more things for themselves. I\u2019ll give you a practical example. A week on Monday, I\u2019m introducing a cap on bus fares in Greater Manchester, so it\u2019d be a \u00a32 cap on an adult journey, \u00a31 on a child journey, and it\u2019s free for 16-18s. And then it\u2019d be \u00a35 cap on fares in a day, no matter how many buses people take. I would say, well, why shouldn\u2019t Glasgow be able to do exactly the same thing to help people through the cost of living crisis?\n\nFor 15 years, the SNP have hollowed out our local communities.\n\n\n\nWe must reset the balance with:\n\n- Fair & secure funding\n\n- Regional partnerships\n\n- Option of Mayors so we get local champions like @AndyBurnhamGM\n\n\n\nRead our plans to push power out of Holyrood: https://t.co/P7sN4mQpqk pic.twitter.com/a0qtUo1zH8 \u2014 Anas Sarwar (@AnasSarwar) August 24, 2022\n\nUpdated at 16.29 BST\n\n4d ago 16.05 Johnson pays tribute to 'incomparable will of Ukrainians to resist' at news conference in Kyiv Boris Johnson told a news conference in Kyiv that Vladimir Putin had been \u201cinsane\u201d to invade Ukraine as he praised the country\u2019s resistance. If we\u2019re paying in our energy bills for the evils of Vladimir Putin, the people of Ukraine are paying in their blood. As PA Media reports, Johnson said \u201clike one of those indomitable Ukrainian boxers\u201d the country \u201ccame off the ropes and hit him with an uppercut that sent Putin\u2019s armies reeling from Kyiv and a hook to drive him from Kharkiv\u201d. He added: Out of the ashes of your towns and cities, out of the monstrous scares that are being left by Putin\u2019s missiles, something beautiful is blooming and it is a flower that the whole world can see and admire, and that is the incomparable will of the Ukrainians to resist.

The Mail group is still very supportive of Johnson and at the weekend it carried a news story based on a briefing circulating among MPs arguing, in effect, that it would be bad for MPs to insist that ministers in the Commons tell them the truth. There was also an opinion piece saying the inquiry was akin to a show trial from Stalin\u2019s Russia \u2013 written by someone who had clearly forgotten what actually happened to the victims of Stalin\u2019s show trials.

The UK is contributing a \u00a354m package of drones and \u201cloitering munitions\u201d, missiles that stay airborne until they identify a target to attack. In its news release about the package, No 10 said: This package of unmanned air systems will be a step up in the Ukrainian\u2019s current capability, improving their long range surveillance and defensive targeting ability. It includes 850 hand-launched Black Hornet micro-drones, which are specifically designed for use in towns and villages, and are deployed to detect approaching enemy forces. Military personnel can be trained to fly the helicopter drones, which are smaller than a mobile phone, in under 20 minutes. Each drone feeds back live video and still images to allow forces on the ground to defend urban areas safely. In a statement Johnson said: Today\u2019s package of support will give the brave and resilient Ukrainian armed forces another boost in capability, allowing them to continue to push back Russian forces and fight for their freedom. What happens in Ukraine matters to us all, which is why I am here today to deliver the message that the United Kingdom is with you and will be with you for the days and months ahead, and you can and will win. This is Johnson\u2019s third visit to Kyiv since the Russian invasion in February. To mark his support for Ukraine, Johnson was awarded the order of liberty, the country\u2019s highest award for foreign nationals.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 15.29 BST\n\n4d ago 14.34 Johnson visits to Kyiv to confirm UK backing for Ukraine Boris Johnson has revealed that he is in Kyiv for what will almost certainly be his final meeting as PM with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. What happens in Ukraine matters to us all.\n\n\n\nThat is why I am in Kyiv today.\n\n\n\nThat is why the UK will continue to stand with our Ukrainian friends.\n\n\n\nI believe Ukraine can and will win this war. pic.twitter.com/FIovnqJGTS \u2014 Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) August 24, 2022\n\n\n\n4d ago 14.09 Levelling up bill does not include funding needed to make levelling up happen, say MPs Although the House of Commons is not sitting over the summer, MPs still have work to do and some who chair select committees have been sending out letters. Clive Betts, the Labour MP who chairs the levelling up committee, says that when Greg Clark replaced Michael Gove as levelling up secretary in July, he asked Betts to tell him over the summer what the committee thought of the levelling up and regeneration bill. Not much seems to be the answer. Today Betts has released the letter he has sent to Clark on behalf of his committee giving an assessment of the bill and here is the key paragraph. It is the committee\u2019s view that the main tool to achieve levelling up will be through appropriate funding to those areas that need it most. This funding will help in making progress on the levelling up missions related to public transport and local connectivity; transforming digital connectivity; improving education outcomes; increasing the number of adults who complete high quality skills training; and increasing healthy life expectancy. None of the provisions in the bill will directly contribute to making progress towards achieving these missions \u2013 other than setting them. There is also no funding for levelling up associated with the bill. Like all select committees, this one has a narrow Conservative majority. And in a statement to journalists Betts said: In its current form, the bill does little to reassure that levelling up will prove to be more than just a slogan and that we will have meaningful change in local communities across the country. In key areas, it is unclear how the government intends to drive change and they are yet to commit to the spending that is necessary to level up the country. Our inquiry has focused on the planning provisions in the bill, which can be described as loosely-connected proposals to tinker with the current system, hopefully achieving some improvement. It has been difficult to conduct scrutiny due to a lot of the detail of the provisions having not yet been published.\n\nUpdated at 17.50 BST",

Amazon.com (AMZN) and UnitedHealth (UNH) are now said to be among the bidders, according to The Wall Street Journal, which had previously reported that CVS Health (CVS) was eyeing Signify.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) \u2013 Bed Bath & Beyond is sliding another 10.2% in premarket trading after Friday's more than 40% plunge. That sell-off followed news that investor Ryan Cohen had sold his shares in the housewares retailer. Bloomberg is also reporting that certain suppliers have halted shipments to Bed Bath & Beyond due to unpaid bills.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) \u2013 The movie theater chain's stock plummeted 30.6% in the premarket ahead of the debut of AMC's so-called \"APE\" preferred equity units. CEO Adam Aron tweeted a reminder to investors that the total value of their AMC holdings would be a combination of the regular shares plus the new units, which were granted as a special dividend.

                "text": "In this article CTRN\n\nCitigroup said it had identified the cause of the flash crash and corrected the error \"within minutes.\" Jim Dyson | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nLONDON \u2014 U.K. inflation is on course to exceed 18% in January as the country's energy price cap enters the stratosphere, Citi economists are projecting. In a research note dated Sunday, the U.S. banking giant updated its forecasts for the consumer price index and retail price index to 18% and 21%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2023. This is based on the assumption of a \u00a3300 policy offset applied to household energy bills from October through to 2024. Energy regulator Ofgem will this week announce the scale of the next price cap increase from Oct. 1, and Citi expects a rise to \u00a33,717 per year ($4,389) from the current \u00a31,971 for an average household. The price cap essentially limits the amount a supplier can charge for their tariffs, but this limit has surged higher recently due to the rise in wholesale prices \u2014 meaning Brits have seen bills skyrocket. Market research firm Cornwall Insight recently predicted that the cap would rise to \u00a34,266 in January, while consultancy firm Auxilione forecast last week that it would exceed \u00a36,000 by the spring. Benjamin Nabarro, senior associate in the global strategy and macro group at Citi, said guidance on future increases would be the most notable aspect of this week's announcement.\n\n\"We expect further increases to \u00a34,567 in January and then \u00a35,816 in April. The risks here remain skewed to the upside,\" Nabarro said. The key question now is how government policy might impact both inflation and the real economy after a new prime minister takes office on Sept. 5. Comments so far from Conservative leadership favorite Liz Truss point to only a \"limited offset\" for headline inflation, he suggested. \"We already account for a \u00a3300 reduction in bills associated with the suspension of the Green Levy and a cut to VAT on household energy bills,\" Nabarro said. \"However, in reality any government response to this is likely to involve substantially more fiscal firepower (around \u00a340bn in our view). Offsetting the energy increase in full would cost around \u00a330bn for the coming six months (1.4% GDP).\"\n\nThe issue for inflation, he added, is that any fiscal space deployed is likely to be squeezed between weaker medium-term forecasts and the new government's desire to cut taxes, meaning disinflationary measures are \"likely somewhat further down the pecking order.\" The Bank of England earlier this month hiked interest rates by 50 basis points, its largest single increase since 1995, and projected the U.K.'s longest recession since the global financial crisis. It also forecast that inflation would peak at 13.3% in October. Citi now expects a further 125 basis points of monetary tightening at the coming three meetings of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee. U.K. inflation hit 10.1% annually in July and is increasingly expected to exceed the MPC's latest projections.",

                "text": "That\u2019s because a less-intense version of the rent surge that is pushing inflation higher across cities in the American south is beginning to play out in bigger cities in the Northeast and on the West Coast. Real-time market rent trackers that reported prices shooting up in Sun Belt cities last year are now showing bigger increases in places like New York, San Jose and Seattle.\n\nInflation F.A.Q. Card 1 of 5 Inflation F.A.Q. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. Inflation F.A.Q. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Inflation F.A.Q. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. Inflation F.A.Q. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Inflation F.A.Q. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose market rent increases take time to trickle into official inflation figures because of the way the government calculates its data. Much as Phoenix\u2019s official inflation numbers are surging now partly because of the run-up in market rents in 2021, nascent increases in big coastal cities could keep pressure on inflation in months to come. And the effect could be palpable at a national level: New York and its suburbs account for about 11 percent of the nation\u2019s rental housing-related costs in the Consumer Price Index, compared to about 1 percent for Phoenix.\n\n\u201cEven if we get a slowdown in the Sun Belt, it may not be enough to offset what we\u2019re seeing in other markets,\u201d said Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights.\n\nFederal Reserve officials noted that risk at their July meeting, according to minutes released Wednesday, observing that \u201cin some product categories, the rate of price increase could well pick up further in the short run, with sizable additional increases in residential rental expenses being especially likely.\u201d\n\nThe Fed has been raising interest rates since March to try to slow consumer and business demand and cool inflation and is expected to lift them again at its meeting in September.\n\nTo date, much of the regional divide in price increases \u2014 from rents to consumer goods and services \u2014 has traced back to migration. People have been flocking to less expensive cities from big coastal ones for years, but that trend accelerated sharply with the onset of the pandemic. The pattern is playing out across both the Mountain West, where inflation is also remarkably high, and the Sun Belt.",

                "text": "Hiring in July was far better than expected, defying multiple other signs that the economic recovery is losing steam, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.\n\nNonfarm payrolls rose 528,000 for the month and the unemployment rate was 3.5%, easily topping the Dow Jones estimates of 258,000 and 3.6%, respectively. The unemployment rate is now back to its pre-pandemic level and tied for the lowest since 1969, though the rate for Blacks rose 0.2 percentage point to 6%.\n\nWage growth also surged higher, as average hourly earnings jumped 0.5% for the month and 5.2% from the same time a year ago. Those numbers add fuel to an inflation picture that already has consumer prices rising at their fastest rate since the early 1980s. The Dow Jones estimate was for a 0.3% monthly gain and 4.9% annual increase.\n\nMore broadly, though, the report showed the labor market remains strong despite other signs of economic weakness.\n\n\"There's no way to take the other side of this. There's not a lot of, 'Yeah, but,' other than it's not positive from a market or Fed perspective,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. \"For the economy, this is good news.\"\n\nMarkets initially reacted negatively to the report as traders anticipated a strong counter move from a Federal Reserve looking to cool the economy and in particular a heated labor market. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day positive, rising about 74 points following a day of choppy trading.\n\nLeisure and hospitality led the way in job gains with 96,000, though the industry is still 1.2 million workers shy of its pre-pandemic level.\n\nProfessional and business services was next with 89,000. Health care added 70,000 and government payrolls grew 57,000. Goods-producing industries also posted solid gains, with construction up 32,000 and manufacturing adding 30,000.\n\nRetail jobs increased by 22,000, despite repeated warnings from executives at Walmart, Target and elsewhere that consumer demand is shifting.\n\nA more encompassing view of unemployment that includes those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons as well as discouraged workers not looking for jobs was unchanged at 6.7%.",

                "text": "Gordon Brown used to joke that there were two sorts of chancellors: the ones who failed and the ones who got out in time. Nadhim Zahawi looks like being in the second category.\n\nAppointed by Boris Johnson on 5 July as he struggled in vain to remain prime minister, Zahawi is likely to be the shortest-serving chancellor since Iain Macleod died in office in 1970. Macleod was in charge of the Treasury for a month; Zahawi\u2019s tenure will probably last only twice as long.\n\nGreat things were expected of Iain Macleod when he became chancellor. Photograph: Central Press/Getty Images\n\nFunny things happen in politics. Despite all the polling evidence to the contrary, Liz Truss might not end up becoming prime minister. And even if, as expected, she sees off the challenge from Rishi Sunak, she could surprise everybody by keeping Zahawi in place.\n\nThe chancellor\u2019s aides say he is enjoying the challenge of the job and was pleased with the way a speech on financial services at the Mansion House was received.\n\nBut there is no getting away from the fact that he feels like an interim appointment, the equivalent of the caretaker football manager given the job for a few weeks while a permanent replacement is found. Even the Mansion House speech was a recommitment to a policy stance agreed under Sunak.\n\nTruss is already thinking about who she wants in her cabinet, and there have been strong rumours that she will move Kwasi Kwarteng from the business department into 11 Downing Street once she replaces Johnson. In February, the last time the energy price cap was lifted, Sunak was ready with measures to ease the burden on consumers that he could announce within hours.\n\nLiz Truss, who is in pole position to become the next UK prime minister, is already considering who she wants in her cabinet. Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Getty Images\n\nWhen the new price cap is announced on Friday, Zahawi\u2019s role will be to reassure the public that help is on the way, if not necessarily from him. The Treasury has drawn up a list of options but it will be up to the next government to decide which approach to adopt.\n\nKwasi Kwarteng. The business secretary is tipped to become chancellor in a Truss-led government. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nZahawi\u2019s official response to the latest inflation rate \u2013 which in July rose above 10% for the first time in four decades \u2013 was telling. \u201cI understand that times are tough, and people are worried about increases in prices that countries around the world are facing,\u201d the chancellor said before going on to outline details of help to consumers announced by Sunak in May. Zahawi\u2019s lame-duck status meant he could offer no reassurance about what extra assistance might be provided in coming months.\n\nOn average, the 26 chancellors since the second world war have lasted three years in the job but if the predictions are correct, Kwarteng will be the fourth since the 2019 general election, a high attrition rate by Treasury standards.\n\nJohn and Norma Major.

Photograph: Tony Harris/PA Archive/PA Photos\n\nThe only comparable period was 1989-93, also a time when there were four chancellors in quick succession: Nigel Lawson, John Major, Norman Lamont and Ken Clarke. Lawson resigned after a disagreement with Margaret Thatcher over economic policy; Major became prime minister after Thatcher\u2019s fall in December 1990; Lamont was made the fall guy for the pound\u2019s ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday.\n\nLamont\u2019s replacement, Clarke, ushered in a period of stability at the Treasury in which there were only four chancellors in 23 years. Clarke lost his job when Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government came to power in 1997; Brown served 10 years before taking over as prime minister just before the financial crisis began in 2007. Alistair Darling lasted just short of three years, and lost office at the 2010 general election. His successor, George Osborne, was at the Treasury until the summer of 2016, when he was fired by Theresa May.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Michael Stephens/PA Archive/PA\n\nMajor was at No 11 for just over a year but the shortest-serving chancellor since Macleod is currently Sajid Javid, who resigned in February 2020 after little more than six months and without announcing a budget.\n\nGreat things were expected of Macleod by the Conservatives when he became chancellor, and his death was a blow from which Ted Heath\u2019s government never really recovered. \u201cQuite apart from the human tragedy, it was an enormous loss to the government,\u201d says the historian Dominic Sandbrook in State of Emergency, his book on Britain between 1970 and 1974. \u201cNone of Heath\u2019s ministers had comparable wit, charisma or rhetorical skill, and certainly none had Macleod\u2019s tactical instinct.\u201d\n\nSajid Javid resigned in February 2020 without announcing a budget. Photograph: Peter Summers/Getty Images\n\nMacleod\u2019s successor was Tony Barber who, in a competitive field, is a contender to be the worst chancellor since 1945. Under Heath\u2019s direction, Barber stoked the fires of inflation with tax cuts, spending increases and reforms of the credit system that unleashed an explosion in lending.\n\nThe tax cuts in the giveaway budget of 1972 would not, Barber insisted, lead to higher inflation but would put downward pressure on the cost of living by boosting productivity and profits.\n\nRishi Sunak, the chancellor from 2020 to 2022, published his resignation letter minutes after Sajid Javid. Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Getty Images\n\nSimilar arguments are made by Truss to justify the package of tax cuts expected in an emergency mini-budget next month, as Sunak\u2019s team has pointed out. Sunak has tried to win support for his more cautious proposals by pointing out the historical parallels between now and 50 years ago: an underlying inflationary problem, a war-induced energy crisis, and a dash for growth.\n\nThe Barber boom quickly turned to bust and, if history repeats itself, the next chancellor will face a monumental challenge. With the US bank Citi predicting inflation will peak next year at 18.6%, any regrets Zahawi has when he leaves No 11 may be short-lived. His is not the reputation that stands to be shredded.",

FTX was profitable, quickly expanding across the globe and saw breakneck growth.\n\nThe crypto exchange's revenue soared more than 1,000% from $89 million to $1.02 billion in 2021. Its profitability, like many start-ups, depends on how you measure it. Operating income was $272 million, up from $14 million a year earlier. FTX saw net income of $388 million last year, up from just $17 million a year earlier.\n\nFTX declined to comment on the leaked financial documents.\n\nThe company brought in $270 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2022, and was on track to do roughly $1.1 billion in revenue in 2022, according to an investor deck shared with CNBC. But it's unclear how FTX held up in the second quarter as crypto prices plunged during the recent so-called \"Crypto Winter.\"\n\nBy way of comparison, publicly traded Coinbase also experienced a cash boom during crypto's bull market, with $7.4 billion in revenue and $3.6 billion of net income last year. But in the second quarter of this year, it reported $808.3 million in revenue, a decline of 64% from the year-ago quarter, and a surprise net loss of $1.1 billion, compared with $1.59 billion in net income a year earlier, as retail trading volumes cratered.\n\nFTX was founded three years ago by former Wall Street quant trader Sam Bankman-Fried. The 30-year-old CEO has recently stepped in as the industry's lender of last resort, looking to backstop companies as liquidity dried up. On top of multiple loans of hundreds of millions of dollars, Bankman-Fried's companies also looked to acquire distressed assets. In July, FTX signed a deal that gives it the option to buy lender BlockFi and was in discussions to acquire South Korean Bithumb. FTX also offered to buy Voyager in August but was turned down for what the company claimed was a \"low ball bid.\"\n\nFTX had roughly $2.5 billion in cash at the end of last year and 27% profit margins, according to the documents. Margins were closer to 50% if advertising and \"related party\" expenses are stripped out. It last raised money in January, collecting $400 million from investors like SoftBank's Vision Fund 2 and Tiger Global, at a $32 billion valuation.",

                "text": "LONDON \u2014 The average cost of a pint of beer in the U.K. has soared by 70% since 2008 \u2014 well ahead of inflation \u2014 and some Londoners are parting with as much as \u00a38 ($9.70) for 568ml of the amber nectar. According to figures from consultancy firm CGA, the average cost of a pint has risen from \u00a32.30 in 2008 to \u00a33.95 in 2022, though prices vary drastically across locations. Average prices rose by 15 pence between 2021 and 2022, up almost 4%, one of the largest year-on-year increases since 2008. The average price of a pint at one unnamed pub in London hit an eye-watering \u00a38.06 this year, the highest CGA has ever recorded, while the lowest nationally was a \u00a31.79 average at a pub in Lancashire, in the northwest of England. U.K. inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.4% in June and is expected to rise beyond 13% in October, compounding the country's historic cost-of-living crisis and prompting the Bank of England to implement its largest interest rate hike since 1995 on Thursday. Many pubs and hospitality venues are concerned that consumers will increasingly stay at home. Paul Bolton, client director for GB drinks at CGA, told CNBC that a combination of supply chain issues, staffing shortages, soaring energy costs, lingering pandemic-era debts and generally high inflation are increasing suppliers' cost pressures, which then have to be passed onto the consumer. Raw materials and energy Francois Sonneville, senior beverage analyst at Rabobank, told CNBC that prices are increasing throughout the value chain, starting with barley. \"The barley price has gone up, and has doubled since 2021. There's two reasons for that: one is that the harvest in North America was really poor, driven by a poor climate, so there was not much inventory to start with \u2013 and then, of course, we had the Black Sea region conflict,\" he told CNBC's Arabile Gumede.\n\nA pint of Adnams Ghost Ship Citrus pale Ale. The Suffolk-based brewer says a combination of soaring energy, labor and raw material costs is squeezing businesses and driving up the price of a pint. Geography Photos/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nHistorically, when grain prices increased, farmers would compensate by planting more the following year, but broader agricultural inflation is also putting a squeeze on farms, outpacing even the 40-year high of 9.4% headline inflation in the U.K. \"Where our normal inflation is running at 8, 9%, (agricultural) inflation for our businesses is running somewhere over 22, 23%,\" explained Richard Hirst, owner of Hirst Farms in Suffolk. \"That's a function of obviously oil prices, fuel \u2013 our tractor diesel has gone up more than three times in price, which is a lot more, relatively, than road fuel has gone up.\" Hirst said the farm is also facing substantial labor cost increases, with shortages affecting the farming industry nationwide, along with fertilizer costs. \"Fertilizer costs will have tripled for next year \u2013 we're buying fertilizer now three times what it was last year. Our chemical inputs are going up and just the cost of running machinery, whether it's spare parts or actually just the cost of buying machinery itself. All that has gone up an awful lot more than the 9 or 10% of normal inflation.\"\n\nHowever, barley is not the main cost incurred during the brewing process \u2013 in fact, it only contributes around 5% of the price of beer at the tap. The biggest costs, analysts and business leaders told CNBC, come from labor, packaging and energy. \"I think that if you look at the brewing process itself, it uses a lot of energy \u2013 and the energy price has gone up, as we all know, when we stop at the pump \u2013 but the most important one is probably packaging,\" Sonneville said. \"Packaging makes up about 25 to 30% of the cost price of beer, and glass packaging, glass bottles, use about 25% of their cost in energy, so with gas prices going 10 times higher now than they were two years ago, that has a massive impact on the cost of a brewer.\" Labor of love His comments were echoed by Andy Wood, CEO of Suffolk-based brewery and hospitality business Adnams, who told CNBC that the energy price increases the company is seeing are \"absolutely eye-watering.\" \"Brewing beer or distilling spirits involves a lot of boiling water, so that involves lots of energy to get to that state, although we've put quite a number of innovations in over the years to limit the impact of that,\" he explained. Wood said in the aftermath of Brexit and the pandemic, a tightening of the U.K. labor market is also exerting upward wage pressure, which will likely be exacerbated by the country's escalating cost-of-living crisis. \"The biggest cost that we have is our payroll because the hospitality part of that business is a people-driven business,\" he added. What's more, the geopolitical headwinds facing businesses throughout the supply chain are unlikely to abate any time soon.\n\n\"So we've got Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we've got the energy crisis that that's brought on, we've got the food supply crisis, grain, cooking oils, these types of things, and then \u2026 we hear in the media that China may be looking longingly at Taiwan, so I think the geopolitical situation is getting no easier, so I think these things are here to stay,\" he said. The question for businesses, according to both Wood and Sonneville, is how many of these costs they can absorb, how much should be passed onto consumers, and in the midst of a cost of living crisis, how to sustain margins without forcing the consumer to stay at home and jeopardizing volumes. Brewers tend to have long-term contracts and hedges in place to ensure contingency plans for future price rises, meaning not all of their costs are fully reflected at present, and therefore not immediately passed onto consumers. \"I think if you look at the price of beer that you and I pay, there is a risk that that will go higher, because there is a lagging effect of costs at the brewery because of those long-term contracts,\" Sonneville said on Monday. \"The hope that I think is there at brewers is that prices will come down. We have not seen that in gas \u2014 we've seen more sanctions there and gas prices have actually risen in the last three days \u2014 but we have seen that grain prices have come off a little bit, and the hope is that that will continue.\" Shifting trends Wood noted that consumer sentiment and behavior had already begun to shift in the face of higher prices at the bar. \"We're certainly seeing people come out earlier in the evening, having their drinks, having their dinner, and then they're going back home,\" he said. \"We're seeing people perhaps having two courses rather than three courses, and perhaps having a glass of wine rather than a bottle of wine, so we are seeing some changes in consumer behavior, there is no doubt about that.\" This was reflected in CGA's latest consumer analysis, which found that premium products and venues offering particularly unique experiences were increasing their share of the on-trade.",

The ONS said the UK had been compensating by increasing imports of refined oil from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nImports of other Russian goods \u2013 including vodka \u2013 have also been wiped out in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine. Bans were announced on a range of Russian products including iron and steel, silver, gold, wood products and high-end goods, and high additional tariffs on other items.\n\nExports from the UK to Russia also fell sharply but to a lesser extent than imports because some goods \u2013 such as pharmaceutical products \u2013 were exempt from the sanctions regime imposed after the invasion on 24 February.\n\nThe ONS said exports stood at \u00a383m in June \u2013 a drop of 67% compared with the 12-month average of \u00a3251m a month in the year leading up to the war.\n\nExports of most commodities to Russia decreased substantially between February and June, with machinery and transport equipment decreasing by \u00a3118m (91.3%).\n\nChemicals were the only commodity exported to Russia that increased over this period, driven by an increase of \u00a339.1m (61.8%) in exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unlike deposits held at U.S. banks, cryptocurrencies stored with brokerages are not protected by the government.\n\n\"Based upon evidence collected by the FDIC, each of these companies made false representations \u2014including on their websites and social media accounts \u2014 stating or suggesting that certain crypto-related products are FDIC-insured or that stocks held in brokerage accounts are FDIC-insured,\" the regulator said in a press release.\n\nIn addition to FTX US, the FDIC notified Cryptonews.com, Cryptosec.info, SmartAsset.com and FDICCrypto.com. The FDIC said the companies must \"take immediate corrective action to address these false or misleading statements.\" The agency said knowingly misrepresenting or implying that an uninsured product is FDIC-insured is prohibited by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.\n\nIn the letter specifically to FTX, the FDIC said it appeared that on July 20, Brett Harrison, the president of FTX.US, published a tweet stating that direct deposits from employers are stored in FDIC-insured accounts in the user's name.\n\nHarrison tweeted on Friday that he deleted that post and didn't mean to indicate that crypto assets stored in FTX are insured by the FDIC, but rather \"USD deposits from employers were held at insured banks.\"\n\n\"We really didn't mean to mislead anyone, and we didn't suggest that FTX US itself, or that crypto/non-fiat assets, benefit from FDIC insurance,\" Harrison wrote.\n\nFTX.US is a U.S. cryptocurrency exchange owned by FTX, which is based in the Bahamas and has been largely focused on building its business outside of the U.S.\n\nThe FDIC also said that the websites for SmartAsset and CryptoSec identify FTX as an \"'FDIC-insured' cryptocurrency exchange.\"\n\nWATCH: Sam Bankfman-Fried's portfolio",

Because we're not just dealing with economic issues like inflation and lapping stimulus and things like that. But also the social issues of people returning to mobility after lockdown, working from home and just the change in consumer patterns.\"\n\nThree months earlier, during the company's prior call with analysts, Gibbs said economists who call this a \"K-shaped recovery,\" where high-income consumers are doing fine while lower-income householders struggle, are oversimplifying the situation.\n\n\"I don't know in my career we've seen a more complex environment to analyze consumer behavior than what we're dealing with right now,\" he said in May, citing inflation, rising wages and federal stimulus spending that's still stoking the economy.\n\nAt the same time, societal issues like the post-Covid reopening and Russia's war in Ukraine are weighing on consumer sentiment, which all \"makes for a pretty complex environment to figure out how to analyze it and market to consumers,\" Gibbs said.\n\nGibbs is right. Things are very strange. Is a recession coming or not?\n\nThere is ample evidence for the \"yes\" camp.\n\nTech and finance are bracing for a downturn with hiring slowdowns and job cuts and pleas for more efficiency from workers. The stock market has been on a nine-month slump with the tech-heavy Nasdaq off more than 20% from its November peak and many high-flying tech stocks down 60% or more.\n\nInflation is causing consumers to spend less on nonessential purchases like clothing so they can afford gas and food.

Absolutely.\u201d Truss says she\u2019s a \u201cbig fan\u201d of grammar schools and wants to introduce new grammar and free schools. Truss says children across the country should have the opportunity to attend grammar schools: \u201cWe must allow the good schools to expand and set up more branches.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 20.53 BST\n\n5d ago 22.06 Summary Corporation tax, \u201cwoke\u201d culture, policing and ethics were recurring themes in tonight\u2019s Conservative party hustings at the NEC in Birmingham. Below is a summary of each candidate\u2019s key messages in their campaign to become Conservative party leader and the next prime minister: Liz Truss Truss says she wants to \u201cpush back\u201d against \u201cidentity politics of the left\u201d and will legislate for single sex spaces such as domestic violence shelters. \u201cI know that a woman is a woman,\u201d she added.\n\nTruss says she will raise defence spending by 3% of GDP by end of the decade.\n\nIn policing, Truss will put more police on the streets to tackle knife and gun crime and wants to introduce league tables to ensure the public can see how their local police forces are performing.\n\nOn taxes, Truss says she will reduce taxes as she doesn\u2019t believe in \u201ctaking money in taxes and giving it back in benefits\u201d in what she calls \u201cGordon Brown economics\u201d.\n\nTruss says she will \u201cunleash opportunities of Brexit\u201d into towns and cities across the country while cutting tax and reversing national insurance increase.\n\nUnder a Truss leadership, schools opening for longer hours and youth clubs will help young people by \u201coffering alternative places to be\u201d, making them less likely to \u201cfall prey to gangs or go off in the wrong direction.\n\nThe extra \u00a313bn the NHS has received has not helped those working on the front line, according to Truss, who says \u201cthe lack of local decision making and the layers that must be tackled to get things done is the real problem, rather than a lack of funding\u201d.\n\nTruss says children across the country should have the opportunity to attend grammar schools: \u201cWe must allow the good schools to expand and set up more branches.\u201d Rishi Sunak Sunak says he has made a U-turn on cutting VAT as there \u201caren\u2019t that many levers that you can pull to offer support that will actually work\u201d, adding that \u201cit\u2019s not perfect\u201d but that he will deal with the \u201cpractical reality of the situation in a way that will make a difference to people in a few weeks\u2019 time\u201d.\n\nThatcher was the \u201cgreatest post-war prime minister\u201d according to Sunak who says that her leadership is the standard he holds himself to.\n\nAn increase in stop and search will be introduced if Sunak becomes PM as he vows that he will \u201cnever let political correctness stand in the way of keeping the country safe\u201d.\n\nOn the NHS, Sunak says patients will pay penalties if they miss medical appointments if he becomes prime minister. Fines will encourage people to cancel appointments in advance and free up time for those in need.\n\nSunak will \u201cturbo charge\u201d energy security and efficiency creating \u201can innovative economy to create small modular reactors to power homes in a cleaner, cheaper way\u201d.\n\nHS2 will continue under a Sunak government but the company behind HS2 will be held to account to minimise disruption.\n\n\u201cChina represents the biggest threat to UK\u2019s economic and national security,\u201d according to Sunak, but UK policy on Taiwan will remain intact as it is the \u201cbest way to prevent aggression against Taiwan from China is by showing Russia that they will not be successful in Ukraine\u201d.\n\nWhen it comes to unionism, Sunak will carry on with current government policy on Northern Ireland but wants to fix Northern Ireland\u2019s economy from being \u201cdragged out of the orbit of the UK\u201d. In Scotland, Sunak wants to highlight the benefit of the union as he believes in \u201cgenuine devolution\u201d. Calling nationalism \u201cvery seductive\u201d, Sunak says that he will fight the idea of nationalism by \u201cspeaking to people\u2019s hearts as prime minister\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 22.19 BST\n\n5d ago 21.47 Sunak will raise corporation tax if prime minister as it\u2019s \u201cnot right to have excessive borrowing\u201d. After the increase, the UK would still havethe lowest corporation tax rate in the G7 and only 70% of companies in the UK will pay higher rate, as the rise only applies to largest companies. For business that are investing, Sunak will offer large tax cuts on Research and Development.\n\nUpdated at 21.50 BST\n\n5d ago 21.40 Sunak will enact the parliament act for Northern Ireland if necessary but wants to secure a negotiated settlement and find a solution to Northern Ireland protocol that \u201cdoesn\u2019t involve a trade war\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 21.51 BST\n\n5d ago 21.35 When it comes to unionism, Sunak will carry on with current government policy on Northern Ireland but wants to fix Northern Ireland\u2019s economy from being \u201cdragged out of the orbit of the UK\u201d. In Scotland, Sunak wants to highlight the benefit of the union as he believes in \u201cgenuine devolution.\u201d Calling nationalism \u201cvery seductive\u201d, Sunak says that he will fight the idea of nationalism by \u201cspeaking to people\u2019s hearts as prime minister\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 21.39 BST\n\n5d ago 21.30 The UK has \u201cunbelievable capacity for compassion in welcoming people from around the world\u201d but government must be \u201cradical\u201d in tackling illegal immigration, says Sunak. He plans to move away from EU definition of asylum saying it\u2019s \u201ctoo broad and allows people to exploit it\u201d. Countries that refuse to take back people who have been rejected for asylum in the UK \u201ccould pay a price in terms of aid\u201d under Sunak leadership.\n\nUpdated at 21.48 BST\n\n5d ago 21.27 Sunak will not reverse UK policy on Taiwan, adding that the \u201cbest way to prevent aggression against Taiwan from China is by showing Russia that they will not be successful in Ukraine\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 21.29 BST\n\n5d ago 21.25 \u201cChina represents the biggest threat to UK\u2019s economic and national security,\u201d says Sunak. The UK must be robust in standing up for \u201cvalues and interests by supporting people in Hong Kong, building up military defences through partnerships with Australia and America, placing aircraft characters in the region and blocking investment from hostile foreign actors\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 21.27 BST\n\n5d ago 21.22 Sunak cannot say he will cancel HS2 but says the company behind HS2 will be held to account to minimise disruption, adding that it\u2019s \u201cnot fair\u201d and that as prime minister he will correct harm done to communities impacted by the build.\n\nUpdated at 21.28 BST\n\n5d ago 21.18 Sunak will \u201cturbo charge\u201d energy security and efficiency meaning under his leadership millions of homes would benefit from loft and cavity wall insulation, saving people up to \u00a3400 off bills. He adds that he will \u201ccreate an innovative economy to create small modular reactors to power homes in a cleaner, cheaper way\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 21.27 BST\n\n5d ago 21.12 \u201cWould your government be more honest than the one we have?\u201d asks audience member. \u201cYes, that\u2019s why I left the government,\u201d Sunak responds, adding that he will appoint an ethics advisor that will have \u201cpower and responsibilities to hold people to account\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 21.28 BST\n\n5d ago 21.09 Rishi Sunak says patients will pay penalties if they miss medical appointments if he becomes prime minister. Fines will encourage people to cancel appointments in advance and free up time for those in need. \u201cIf we get it right, we free up tonnes of extra healthcare and will get the backlogs down quicker,\u201d he adds.\n\nUpdated at 21.10 BST\n\n5d ago 21.05 Sunak offers condolences to the family of nine-year-old girl, Olivia Pratt-Korbel, shot dead in Liverpool, saying the police must be focused on the right things, use their time effectively and harness the best techniques available, including increasing stop and search measures, which Sunak claims is a \u201cvery effective policing tool\u201d. He adds that he will \u201cnever let political correctness stand in the way of keeping the country safe\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 21.28 BST\n\n5d ago 20.57 Thatcher was the \u201cgreatest post-war prime minister\u201d who was prepared to \u201cmake difficult decisions when she had to, to say the things people didn\u2019t want to hear, and that\u2019s the standard I hold myself to\u201d, says Sunak.\n\nUpdated at 20.59 BST\n\n5d ago 20.53 Sunak says he \u201ctakes collective responsibility seriously\u201d and that he could not serve in a Truss cabinet as he has \u201chad a period of being at odds with his leader\u201d and \u201cwon\u2019t do it again\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 20.55 BST",

                "text": "In this article OXY\n\nBRK.A\n\nWarren Buffett at a press conference during the Berkshire Hathaway Shareholders Meeting on April 30, 2022. CNBC\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway on Friday received regulatory approval to purchase up to 50% of oil giant Occidental Petroleum. Shares of Occidental jumped 10% on the news to close at $71.29 apiece, pushing their 2022 gains to more than 145%. On July 11, Berkshire filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to buy more of the oil company's common stock in secondary market transactions. The conglomerate argued that a maximum 50% stake wouldn't hurt competition or diminish regulatory authority. Carlos Clay, acting director of division of electric power regulation, granted the permission Friday, saying authorization was \"consistent with the public interest.\" The conglomerate has already increased its Occidental stake drastically this year. Berkshire currently owns 188.5 million shares of Occidental, equal to a 20.2% position. It surpassed a key threshold where Berkshire could record some of the oil company's earnings with its own, potentially adding billions of dollars in profit.\n\nBerkshire also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock, and has warrants to buy another 83.9 million common shares for $5 billion, or $59.62 each. The warrants were obtained as part of the company's 2019 deal that helped finance Occidental's purchase of Anadarko. The stake would rise to nearly 27% if Berkshire exercises those warrants. Acquiring the whole company? Friday's news fueled speculation that Buffett will be interested in acquiring the whole company eventually after ramping up his stake at low prices. \"He will likely continue to buy as much as he can get below $70 or $75. If you own 30% or 40% and would like to buy it out at $95 or $100, you saved a lot of money,\" said Cole Smead, president of Smead Capital Management and a Berkshire shareholder. \"This stock trades like a casino. The market is giving him all the stock he wants.\" David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business, said an acquisition down the road is likely.",

                "text": "Initial claims for unemployment insurance totaled 260,000 last week, near the highest level since November amid a shift in the U.S. labor market. The total for the week ended July 30 was in line with the Dow Jones estimate but a gain of 6,000 from the previous week's downwardly revised level, the Labor Department reported Thursday. In other economic news, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services decreased to $79.6 billion in June, down $5.3 billion and slightly lower than the estimate for $80 billion. The jobless claims number comes a day before the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its much anticipated nonfarm payrolls report for July. That is expected the show the U.S. economy added 258,000 positions in the month, compared with the 372,000 initial June estimate and the lowest total since December 2020.\n\nA sign for hire is posted on the window of a Chipotle restaurant in New York, April 29, 2022. Shannon Stapleton | Reuters\n\n\"The labor market remains in good shape as the summer quarter progresses but the rise in initial claims since early April is a cold breeze blowing at the hot labor market this summer,\" said Stuart Hoffman, senior economic advisor at PNC Financial Services. Federal Reserve officials are watching the jobs market closely for clues about an economy that is showing the highest inflation rate in more than 40 years. Jobless claims had been running around their lowest levels since the late 1960s but started ticking higher in June as inflation pressures swelled and companies started cutting back on hires. Even with robust hiring in 2021 and the first half of 2022, the total employment level is 755,000 below where it was in February 2020, the last month before the Covid pandemic hit. The four-week moving average of jobless claims, which smooths out weekly volatility, reflects the shift in the jobs market. That number rose 6,000 from the previous week to 254,750, up sharply from the recent low of 170,500 on April 2 and the highest level of the year. Continuing claims, which run a week behind the headline number, totaled 1.42 million, up 48,000 from the prior week and 83,000 from the beginning of July.\n\nTrade deficit comes off record high",

                "text": "If the U.S. economy is in recession, someone forgot to tell the jobs market. The employment picture over the past six months is behaving nothing like an economy in a downturn, instead creating jobs at a rapid pace of nearly 460,000 a month. Research from CNBC's Steve Liesman indicates that during a typical downturn, the employment picture would be far gloomier, losing ground instead of gaining. Several charts presented during Wednesday's \"Squawk Box\" help paint the picture. The CNBC team looked at economic data going back to 1947. It indicated that when gross domestic product has been negative for six months, as is the case for 2022, payrolls fall by an average of 0.5 percentage point. But this year, the job count actually has increased by 1%.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards CNBC\n\nData from human relations software company UKG backs up that notion, with internal data that shows jobs have been created about in line with the Bureau of Labor Statistics' count.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nFinally, the Dallas Federal Reserve, in research posted Tuesday, said its analysis of multiple data points found \"that most indicators \u2014 particularly those measuring labor markets \u2014 provide strong evidence that the U.S. economy did not fall into a recession in the first quarter\" of the year. One data point the central bank's researchers looked at was real personal consumption expenditures. They found that consumption generally declined during recessions. By contrast, the measure increased during the first half of 2022.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards",

                "text": "Check out the companies making the biggest moves midday:\n\nCisco Systems \u2014 Shares of the networking equipment producer jumped 5.8%. The company reported earnings after the bell on Wednesday that beat estimates. Cisco also provided a better-than-expected forecast for 2023.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond \u2014 The latest favored meme stock, which has surged in August, dropped almost 20%. Investors appeared to be reacting to activist investor Ryan Cohen's filing that he intends to sell his entire stake in the company.\n\nKohl's \u2014 Kohl's shares sank more than 7% after the retailer slashed its financial forecast for the year, citing inflation pressures on middle-income customers. The company expects net sales in fiscal 2022 down 5% to 6%, down from a prior range of flat to up 1%. However, Kohl's beat analysts' expectations for fiscal second-quarter profit and revenue.\n\nBJ's Wholesale \u2014 Shares of the club retailer popped more than 7% on Thursday after BJ's reported better-than-expected results for the second quarter. The company generated $1.06 in adjusted earnings per share on $5.01 billion of revenue. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting 80 cents per share on $4.67 billion of revenue. The company's comparable sales rose 7.6% year over year, excluding gasoline. BJ's was also upgraded by Bank of America to a buy from neutral.\n\nElanco Animal Health \u2014 Shares of Elanco shed more than 4% after the company was downgraded by Morgan Stanley. The firm shifted the stock to equal weight from overweight citing concerns about future profits.\n\nVerizon \u2014 Shares of Verizon slipped 2.54% after MoffettNathanson downgraded it to underperform and slashed its price target. Increased competition from AT&T and T-Mobile is weighing on Verizon and will likely drag shares lower, analysts said.\n\nCanadian Solar \u2014 The solar equipment and services company hit a new 52-week high, popping more than 15%, after reporting quarterly profits that beat expectations. Canadian Solar also raised its full-year revenue forecast and reported solar module shipments that were at the high end of its forecast.\n\nWolfspeed \u2014 Shares surged more than 31% after the semiconductor company surpassed expectations in its most recent earnings report. Wolfspeed CEO Gregg Lowe said he remains \"very encouraged about the industry's prospects for future growth and the activity we are seeing across our end-markets.\"\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance \u2014 Shares of Walgreens fell more than 5% in trading Thursday. The drugstore chain, along with CVS and Walmart, was ordered Wednesday by a federal judge to pay a combined $650.6 million to two Ohio counties to address damage done by the opioid crisis. Walgreens also announced Wednesday it had sold 11 million shares of Option Care Health's common stock in an underwritten secondary offering.\n\nEnergy stocks \u2014 Energy stocks were buoyed by the rise in oil prices, with shares of Devon Energy and Halliburton rising more than 5%, and APA adding more than 8%. Exxon Mobil gained more than 2% and Occidental Petroleum rallied 3%..\n\n\u2014CNBC's Jesse Pound, Carmen Reinicke and Sarah Min contributed reporting.",

                "text": "Passengers at an American Airlines gate at the Dallas/Fort Worth International airport in Dallas. Scott Mlyn | CNBC\n\nIt wasn't long ago that Amazon, Shopify and Peloton doubled their workforces to manage through the pandemic surge, while Morgan Stanley staffed up to handle a record level of IPOs, and mortgage lenders added headcount as rock-bottom rates led to a refinancing boom. On the flipside, Delta Air Lines, Hilton Worldwide and legions of restaurants slashed headcount because of lockdowns that rolled through much of the country and other parts of the world. Now, they're scrambling to reverse course. Companies that hired like crazy in 2020 and 2021 to meet customer demand are being forced to make sweeping cuts or impose hiring freezes with a possible recession on the horizon. In a matter of months, CEOs have gone from hypergrowth mode to concerns over \"macroeconomic uncertainty,\" a phrase investors have heard many times on second-quarter earnings calls. Stock trading app Robinhood and crypto exchange Coinbase both recently slashed more than 1,000 jobs after their splashy market debuts in 2021. Meanwhile, airlines, hotels and eateries face the opposite problem as their businesses continue to pick up following the era of Covid-induced shutdowns. After instituting mass layoffs early in the pandemic, they can't hire quickly enough to satisfy demand and are dealing with a labor market radically different from the one they experienced over two years ago, before the cutbacks. \"The pandemic created very unique, once-in-a-lifetime conditions in many different industries that caused a dramatic reallocation of capital,\" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at job recruiting site ZipRecruiter. \"Many of those conditions no longer apply so you're seeing a reallocation of capital back to more normal patterns.\"\n\nFor employers, those patterns are particularly challenging to navigate, because inflation levels have jumped to a 40-year high, and the Fed has lifted its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point on consecutive occasions for the first time since the early 1990s. The central bank's efforts to tamp down inflation have raised concerns that the U.S. economy is headed for recession. Gross domestic product has fallen for two straight quarters, hitting a widely accepted rule of thumb for recession, though the National Bureau of Economic Research hasn't yet made that declaration. The downward trend was bound to happen eventually, and market experts lamented the frothiness in stock prices and absurdity of valuations as late as the fourth quarter of last year, when the major indexes hit record highs led by the riskiest assets. That was never more evident than in November, when electric vehicle maker Rivian went public on almost no revenue and quickly reached a market cap of over $150 billion. Bitcoin hit a record the same day, touching close to $69,000. Since then, bitcoin is off by two-thirds, and Rivian has lost about 80% of its value. In July, the car company started layoffs of about 6% of its workforce. Rivian's headcount almost quintupled to around 14,000 between late 2020 and mid-2022.\n\nTech layoffs and an air of caution\n\nJob cuts and hiring slowdowns were big talking points on tech earnings calls last week. Amazon reduced its headcount by 99,000 people to 1.52 million employees at the end of the second quarter after almost doubling in size during the pandemic, when it needed to beef up its warehouse capabilities. Shopify, whose cloud technology helps retailers build and manage online stores, cut about 1,000 workers, or around 10% of its global workforce. The company doubled its headcount over a two-year period starting at the beginning of 2020, as the business boomed from the number or stores and restaurants that had to suddenly go digital. Shopify CEO Tobias Lutke said in a memo to employees that the company had wagered that the pandemic surge would cause the transition from physical retail to ecommerce to \"permanently leap ahead by 5 or even 10 years.\" \"It's now clear that bet didn't pay off,\" Lutke wrote, adding that the picture was starting to look more like it did before Covid. \"Ultimately, placing this bet was my call to make and I got this wrong. Now, we have to adjust.\" After Facebook parent Meta missed on its results and forecast a second straight quarter of declining revenue, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will be reducing job growth over the next year. Headcount expanded by about 60% during the pandemic. \"This is a period that demands more intensity and I expect us to get more done with fewer resources,\" Zuckerberg said. Google parent Alphabet, which grew its workforce by over 30% during the two Covid years, recently told employees that they needed to focus and improve productivity. The company asked for suggestions on how to be more efficient at work.\n\n\"It's clear we are facing a challenging macro environment with more uncertainty ahead,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said in a meeting with employees. \"We should think about how we can minimize distractions and really raise the bar on both product excellence and productivity.\" Few U.S. companies have been hit as hard as Peloton, whose fitness equipment and on-demand classes became an instant gym replacement during lockdowns and which has since suffered from massive oversupply issues and out-of-control costs. After doubling headcount in the 12 months ended June 30, 2021, the company in February announced plans to cut 20% of corporate positions as it named a new CEO.\n\nBanks and Wall Street bracing for a 'hurricane'\n\nSome of the Peloton products that were flying off the shelves in the pandemic were being offered as perks for overworked junior bankers, who were sorely needed to help manage a boom in IPOs, mergers and stock issuance. Activity picked up with such ferocity that junior bankers were complaining about 100-hour workweeks, and banks started scouting for talent in unusual places like consulting and accounting firms. That helps explain why the six biggest U.S. banks added a combined 59,757 employees from the start of 2020 through the middle of 2022, the equivalent of the industry picking up the full population of a Morgan Stanley or a Goldman Sachs in a little over two years. It wasn't just investment banking. The government unleashed trillions of dollars in stimulus payments and small business loans designed to keep the economy moving amid the widespread shutdowns. A feared wave of loan defaults never arrived, and banks instead took in an unprecedented flood of deposits. Their Main Street lending operations had better repayment rates than before the pandemic. Among top banks, Morgan Stanley saw the biggest jump in headcount, with its employee levels expanding 29% to 78,386 from early 2020 to the middle of this year. The growth was fueled in part by CEO James Gorman\u2019s acquisitions of money management firms E-Trade and Eaton Vance. At rival investment bank Goldman Sachs, staffing levels jumped 22% to 47,000 in the same time frame, as CEO David Solomon broke into consumer finance and bolstered wealth management operations, including through the acquisition of fintech lender GreenSky. Citigroup saw a 15% boost in headcount during the pandemic, while JPMorgan Chase added 8.5% to its workforce, becoming the industry's largest employer. But the good times on Wall Street didn\u2019t last. The stock market had its worst first half in 50 years, and IPOs dried up. Investment banking revenue at the major players declined sharply in the second quarter. Goldman Sachs responded by slowing hiring and is considering a return to year-end job reductions, according to a person with knowledge of the bank\u2019s plans. Employees typically make up the single biggest line item when it comes to expenses in banking, so when markets crater, layoffs are usually on the horizon. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in June that an economic \"hurricane\" was on its way, and said the bank was bracing itself for volatile markets.\n\nJamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., during a Bloomberg Television interview in London, U.K., on Wednesday, May 4, 2022. Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nZipRecruiter's Pollak said one area in finance where there will likely be a hemorrhaging of workers is in mortgage lending. She said 60% more people went into real estate in 2020 and 2021 because of record low mortgage rates and rising home prices. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo have reportedly trimmed hundreds of mortgage staffers as volumes collapsed. \"Nobody is refinancing anymore, and sales are slowing,\" Pollak said. \"You're going to have to see employment levels and hiring slow down. That growth was all about that moment.\" The intersection of Silicon Valley and Wall Street is a particularly gloomy place at the moment as rising rates and crumbling stock multiples converge. Crypto trading platform Coinbase in June announced plans to lay off 18% of its workforce in preparation for a \"crypto winter\" and even rescinded job offers to people it had hired. Headcount tripled in 2021 to 3,730 employees. Stock trading app Robinhood said Tuesday it's cutting about 23% of its workforce, a little over three months after eliminating 9% of its full-time staff, which had ballooned from 2,100 to 3,800 in the last nine months of 2021. \"We are at the tail end of that pandemic-era distortion,\" said Aaron Terrazas, chief economist at job search and review site Glassdoor. \"Obviously, it's not going away, but it is changing to a more normalized period, and companies are adapting to this new reality.\"\n\nRetail is whipsawing back and forth\n\nNurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThey hardly could have predicted how quickly the dynamic would shift, as rapid and soaring inflation forced Americans to tighten their belts. Retailers have already started to warn of waning demand, leaving them with bloated inventories. Gap said higher promotions will hurt gross margins in its fiscal second quarter. Kohl's cut its guidance for the second quarter, citing softened consumer spending. Walmart last week slashed its profit forecast and said surging prices for food and gas are squeezing consumers. That pain is filtering into the ad market. Online bulletin board Pinterest on Monday cited \"lower than expected demand from U.S. big box retailers and mid-market advertisers\" as one reason why it missed Wall Street estimates for second-quarter earnings and revenue. Retail giants have so far avoided big layoff announcements, but smaller players are in cut mode. Stitch Fix, 7-Eleven and Game Stop have said they'll be eliminating jobs, and outdoor grill maker Weber warned it's considering layoffs as sales slow.\n\nThe travel industry can't hire fast enough\n\nWith all of the downsizing taking place across wide swaths of the U.S. economy, the applicant pool should be wide open for airlines, restaurants and hospitality companies, which are trying to repopulate their ranks after undergoing mass layoffs when Covid hit. It's not so easy. Even though Amazon has reduced headcount of late, it's still got far more people working in its warehouses than it did two years ago. Last year the company lifted average starting pay to $18 an hour, a level that's difficult to meet for much of the services industry. Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta said on the quarterly earnings call in May that he wasn't satisfied with customer service and that the company needs more workers. At the end of last year, even as travel was rebounding sharply, headcount at Hilton's managed, owned and leased properties as well as corporate locations was down by over 30,000 from two years earlier. It's easy to see why customer service is a challenge. According to a report last week from McKinsey on summer 2022 travel trends, revenue per available room in the U.S. \"is outstripping not just 2020 and 2021 levels, but increasingly 2019 levels too.\"\n\nDelta Airlines passenger jets are pictured outside the newly completed 1.3 million-square foot $4 billion Delta Airlines Terminal C at LaGuardia Airport in New York, June 1, 2022.

                "text": "(Click here to subscribe to the Delivering Alpha newsletter.)\n\nWhen Peter Kraus founded Aperture Investors, he deviated from the traditional active management model. Rather than raking in fixed fees, Kraus' $3.8 billion firm operates on a fee structure linked to performance, charging 30 percent of alpha. That's higher than the industry standard but since inception, about half of Aperture's funds have delivered alpha above their benchmarks. Kraus sat down with CNBC's Delivering Alpha newsletter to explain why he's focused on a pay-for-performance set-up and how he's putting capital to work in the current environment.\n\n(The below has been edited for length and clarity. See above for full video.)\n\nLeslie Picker: What do you see as the key problem with the traditional model? And what do you think is the best way to fix it?\n\nPeter Kraus: The key problem is very simple. The existing model in almost all cases, rewards people whether or not they perform. So, it's a fixed fee and as assets grow, you earn more money. Well, clients don't actually hire us to grow our assets, they hire us to perform. So, you would think the performance fee or the actual fee would be connected to the performance as opposed to the asset growth. We also know that asset growth is the enemy of performance. It's harder and harder to perform, the more assets that you manage. So, the fee doesn't help you - that traditional fee doesn't help in that regard, because the manager is incentivized to continue to grow assets, and that makes it harder and harder to perform.\n\nOf course, there are performance fees in the marketplace and hedge funds and private equity, but they also have rather large management fees. So, they too have some incentive to grow their assets. Basically Aperture is the anathema to that - it's the opposite. We charge a very low base fee that's equal to the ETF and then we only charge if we beat the index. So, you pay for performance. If we don't have any performance, you pay what you pay to buy the ETF.\n\nPicker: So, then how do you choose which index is relevant for the specific strategies?. I mean, do you invest in certain ways that would mirror or would be comparable to certain indexes that you're able to then outperform?\n\nKraus: Exactly. So, we're very, very thoughtful about the index because we're actually charging people to beat the index. So, for example, in global equities, we would use the MSCI global equity index. For U.S. small cap, we would use the Russell 2000. For European equities, we would use the Euro Stoxx Index. Very simple indices, not complex, no real question about whether the manager is actually creating a portfolio that is following that index. In fact, we actually test the correlation of the portfolio to the index to make sure the index continues to be relevant.\n\nPicker: People who advocate for their management fee will say that it's necessary, essentially, to keep the lights on - that it basically ensures that the operations of the fund can meet all of their fixed costs and cover their expenses. How are you able to do so with a lower management fee?\n\nKraus: People say, well, I need to keep the lights on. Well, okay, how many assets do you need to keep the lights on? And once you have the lights on, then do you need to keep charging the fixed fee? Because your incentive is just to continue to gather assets. So, it's really a function of how many assets we have and we've created a company where we think that assets scale pretty much speaks for revenues to cover the fixed expenses. And then the rest is only earned if we perform. One of the things that I like about Aperture is that I'm incentivized, as the owner of the business identically with the client. I don't make much money, if any money, unless we actually perform.\n\nPicker: What about your ability to recruit and pay employees? Does it have any bearing on compensation?\n\nKraus: Sure does. The portfolio managers are paid a strict percentage of the performance fee. So, portfolio managers are usually paid 35% of the 30% that we charge. We charge a 30% performance fee and we pay the management, to the portfolio managers and their team, 35% of that. And we've selected that percentage because we think that that is highly competitive with both the hedge fund industry as well as the long-only industry. And if managers perform on the amount of capital that they have, their compensation can be quite attractive. And that's, in effect, how we believe we can attract some of the best talent in the marketplace.\n\nPicker: It doesn't appear though, at least in the current environment, that LPs are too dissuaded by the traditional model. I mean, there were nearly 200 hedge fund launches in Q1 outpacing the number of liquidations. AUM stands around $4 trillion for the hedge fund industry overall. So, it doesn't appear that LPS have really been pushing back, at least in terms of new launches and total AUM size. So, I'm just curious kind of what your conversations have been like on that front?\n\nKraus: Well, there's $4 trillion in the hedge fund community but there's $32 trillion in the long-only community. And I don't think that it's a question that is hard to answer. If you look at the trend between the active management industry and the passive industry, money's been moving to the passive industry at a rapid pace - unchanged for 10 years. And the hedge fund space, the $4 trillion - we're talking about all sorts of different types of hedge funds, for sure, it's not a monolithic industry. But essentially, most managers or most allocators that I speak to would rather not pay a performance fee times the beta that their money is exposed to. They would like to pay a performance fee for actually the performance. And so, we offer that clarity, which many hedge funds do not. And in the long-only space, there's virtually no payment for performance. It's almost all fixed.\n\nPicker: Since there's so much on the line with regard to performance, I have to ask you, what's your strategy? What's your what's your thinking right now? How are you putting capital to work in the current environment in a way that you believe will outperform the benchmarks?\n\nKraus: It depends upon the strategy, whether it's an equity strategy or fixed income strategy. But in the equity strategies, we are what you would expect - highly research dependent, looking for specific opportunities with companies that we think have long term growth, or undervalue and will accelerate their value over time. And that timeframe is usually 18 months to three years. In the credit space, again, it's fundamental research to find credits and obviously being careful about the market because credit markets tend to be more macro driven. But it's all of the above and that's what we spend our time doing. We think that if we do that consistently over time, we can perform.\n\nPicker: Are you net long or net short in the current environment?\n\nKraus: Interestingly enough, in the one hedge fund that we do run, we're pretty close to flat. So, I would say a very low net position. In the other funds that we run, we run 100% long. So, in other words, we are what I call beta one, exposed to the index by 100%. But we do have shorts, so we're gross more than 100% in those funds. But I would say in general, right now, our risk positions are low.\n\nPicker: So, not much leverage then?\n\nKraus: Not much leverage, but more importantly, the actual stocks and bonds that we are choosing and the positions we're taking, we're on, I would say, the low end of our risk scale.",

                "text": "Both Bullard and Mester are voting members this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. The group last week approved a second consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase to the Fed's benchmark borrowing rate.\n\nThat message of continued rate hikes is consistent with other Fed speakers this week , including regional presidents Loretta Mester of Cleveland, Charles Evans of Chicago and Mary Daly of San Francisco. Each said Tuesday that the inflation fight is far from over and more monetary policy tightening will be needed.\n\n\"I think we'll probably have to be higher for longer in order to get the evidence that we need to see that inflation is actually turning around on all dimensions and in a convincing way coming lower, not just a tick lower here and there,\" Bullard said during a live \" Squawk Box \" interview on CNBC.\n\nThe central bank official said he expects another 1.5 percentage points or so in interest rate increases this year as the Fed continues to battle the highest inflation levels since the early 1980s.\n\nSt. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Wednesday that the central bank will continue raising rates until it sees compelling evidence that inflation is falling.\n\nIf Bullard has his way, the rate will continue rising to a range of 3.75%-4% by the end of the year. After starting 2022 near zero, the rate has now come up to a range of 2.25%-2.5%.\n\nConsumer price inflation is running at a 12-month rate of 9.1%, its highest since November 1981. Even throwing out the highs and lows of inflation, as the Dallas Fed does with its \"trimmed mean\" estimate, inflation is running at 4.3%.\n\n\"We're going to have to see convincing evidence across the board, headline and other measures of core inflation, all coming down convincingly before we'll be able to feel like we're doing our job,\" Bullard said.\n\nThe rate hikes come at a time of slowing growth in the U.S., which has seen consecutive quarters of negative GDP readings, a common definition of recession. However, Bullard said he doesn't think the economy is really in recession.\n\n\"We're not in a recession right now. We do have these two quarters of negative GDP growth. To some extent, a recession is in the eyes of the beholder,\" he said. \"With all the job growth in the first half of the year, it's hard to say there's a recession. With a flat unemployment rate at 3.6%, it's hard to say there's a recession.\"\n\nThe second half of the year should see reasonably strong growth, though job gains probably will slow to their longer-run trend, he added. July's nonfarm payroll growth is expected to be 258,000, according to Dow Jones estimates.\n\nEven with the slowing trend, markets are pricing in another half percentage point rate hike from the Fed in September, though the chances of a third consecutive 0.75 percentage point move are rising. The market then expects future increases in November and December, taking the benchmark fed funds rate to a range of 3.25%-3.5% by the end of the year, below Bullard's target.\n\n\"We're going to follow the data very carefully, and I think we'll get it right,\" Bullard said.",

                "text": "A cooldown in the job market is underway: The number of job openings dropped in June while near-record numbers of people continued to quit and get hired into new roles, according to the Labor Department's latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary. The labor market posted 10.7 million new job openings in June, which is down from 11.3 million in May but also much higher than a year ago and a more than 50% increase from before the pandemic. Despite the drop, there are still roughly 1.8 open jobs for every person who is unemployed. Meanwhile, workers are continuing to leverage the market and make moves: 6.4 million people were hired into new jobs, and 4.2 million voluntarily quit \u2014 leveling off from record highs but still extremely elevated. The job market cooldown is \"far from a plunge,\" says Nick Bunker, director of economic research at Indeed Hiring Lab. \"The labor market is loosening a bit, but by any standard it is still quite tight,\" Bunker adds. \"The outlook for economic growth may not be as rosy as it was a few months ago, but there's no sign of imminent danger in the labor market.\"\n\nPeople are concerned about the future of jobs but are still quitting now\n\nWorkers are growing more concerned about having their pick of jobs in the months to come, but it's not stopping many of them from calling it quits right now. The share of people who left their jobs voluntarily in June make up 2.8% of the workforce. Workers' confidence in the job market decreased slightly in June and July compared with May, according to a ZipRecruiter index measuring sentiment across 1,500 people. The index also showed an uptick in job-seekers who believe there will be fewer jobs six months from now, a decrease in people who say their job search is going well and a slight increase in people who feel financial pressure to accept the first job offer they receive. People may also be spooked by headlines of big-name companies, especially ones across tech and housing sectors that saw Covid-era growth, announcing layoffs, hiring freezes and rescinded job offers in recent months. Bunker recognizes \"there are pockets of the economy and labor market going through turbulence,\" he says, \"but they're for the most part concentrated pockets.\" These workers may also be getting hired into new jobs pretty quickly. The national unemployment rate held steady at 3.6% in June. Looking ahead, Bunker expects to see payroll growth and expanding employment in the jobs report out Friday. \"If you're thinking of switching jobs, it's still a good time,\" he says, adding that job-seekers may focus more on going to an industry, sector or employer with a \"strong economic outlook.\"\n\nA hiring slowdown doesn't indicate an inevitable recession",

Kohl's most recent quarter beat Street forecasts for revenue and profit.\n\nBJ's Wholesale (BJ) \u2013 The warehouse retailer beat estimates by 26 cents with an adjusted quarterly profit of $1.06 per share and revenue also topped forecasts. Comparable store sales increased more than expected, and the stock rallied 5.4% in premarket trading.\n\nTapestry (TPR) \u2013 Tapestry moved between gains and losses in premarket action after its earnings came in above consensus despite sales that were slightly short of forecasts. The company behind luxury brands Coach and Kate Spade also raised its quarterly dividend by 20%.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) \u2013 Estee Lauder shares fell 1.3% in the premarket after the cosmetics maker forecast full-year sales below consensus, due to Covid-related lockdowns in China. Estee Lauder's profit and revenue for its most recent quarter beat Wall Street estimates.\n\nCanadian Solar (CSIQ) \u2013 The solar equipment and services company reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and solar module shipments that were at the high end of its prior forecast. Canadian Solar also raised its full-year revenue forecast, and its stock jumped 6.2% in premarket trading.\n\nBath & Body Works (BBWI) \u2013 Bath & Body Works reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, but gave a current-quarter forecast that was weaker than expected.

Cohen's prior purchases of call options had contributed to a buying spree in Bed Bath & Beyond, with the stock up in 15 of the past 16 sessions and increasing more than five-fold in value over that time.\n\nWolfspeed (WOLF) \u2013 Wolfspeed rocketed higher by 20.9% in the premarket after the semiconductor company reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss and revenue that beat consensus estimates.

                "text": "Mary Daly, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, poses after giving a speech on the U.S. economic outlook, in Idaho Falls, Idaho, U.S., November 12 2018.\n\nThe Federal Reserve still has a lot of work to do before it gets inflation under control, and that means higher interest rates, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Tuesday.\n\n\"People are still struggling with the higher prices they're paying and the rising prices,\" Daly said during a live LinkedIn interview with CNBC's Jon Fortt. \"The number of people who can't afford this week what they paid for with ease six months ago just means our work is far from done.\"\n\nSeparately, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans opened up the possibility of another large rate hike ahead, but said he hopes that can be avoided, with the Fed being able to bring down inflation without having to use harsh policy tightening.\n\nSo far this year, the central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate four times, totaling 2.25 percentage points. That has come in response to inflation running at a 9.1% annual rate, the highest level since November 1981.\n\nThe Fed in July raised its funds rate 0.75 percentage point, the same as it hiked in June. Those were the largest back-to-back increases since the central bank started using the funds rate as its chief monetary policy tool in the early 1990s.\n\nBut Daly cautioned that no one should take those big moves as an indication that the Fed is winding down its rate hikes.\n\n\"Nowhere near almost done,\" she said in assessing the progress. \"We have made a good start and I feel really pleased with where we've gotten to at this point.\"\n\nFutures pricing indicates the markets see the Fed raising rates by 0.5 percentage point in September and another half percentage point through the end of the year, taking the funds rate to a range of 3.25%-3.5%, according to CME Group data. That scenario holds that the economy would slow due to the policy tightening, and the Fed would start cutting rates by next summer.\n\nBut Daly pushed back on that notion.\n\n\"That's a puzzle to me,\" she said. \"I don't know where they find that in the data. To me, that would not be my modal outlook.\"\n\nEvans, her Fed colleague, also spoke Tuesday morning, saying the central bank is likely to keep its foot on the brake until it sees inflation coming down. He expects policymakers to raise rates by half a percentage point at their next meeting in September, but left the door open to a bigger move.\n\n\"Fifty [basis points] is a reasonable assessment, but 75 could also be OK,\" he told reporters. \"I doubt that more would be called for.\" A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.\n\n\"We wanted to get to neutral expeditiously. We want to get a little restrictive expeditiously,\" Evans added. \"We want to see if the real side effects are going to start coming back in line ... or if we have a lot more ahead of us.\"\n\nHowever, he also said he's hopeful that policymakers could soon pause the rate hikes as inflation comes down.\n\nNeither Evans nor Daly are voting members this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, though they do participate in policy sessions.\n\nThe FOMC does not meet in August, when it will hold its annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Its next two-day meeting is next month, Sept. 20-21.",

Wildpixel | Istock | Getty Images\n\nA smooth and \"complete decentralization\" of Web3 is not yet a reality, said Randi Zuckerberg, referring to a system in which users rather than companies have ownership of services and data. The sister of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was speaking at the Global Supertrends Conference 2022 on Wednesday. The Web3 is a hypothetical, future version of the internet based on blockchain technology \u2014 an \"ideal utopia,\" said Zuckerberg. \"But \u2026 that's not what's happening. What's happening in reality, is chaos.\"\n\nThe founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media, a production company and marketing consultancy, added, \"You're the only one watching your own back and your own assets, people are spending time protecting themselves by setting up so many different wallets and protecting their identity and that's not contributing to development in the area.\" Zuckerberg, who was an early employee at Meta \u2014 formerly known as Facebook \u2014 explained that various metaverses are now acting as \"their own walled garden,\" in which users are unable to use their assets across platforms. The metaverse can be loosely defined as a virtual world where people live, work and play. With cryptocurrency, users can buy and develop virtual land or dress their own avatars.\n\n\"Right now, I'm on Decentraland, my son is on Roblox, my other son is on Fortnite. That's great \u2014 we're all in the metaverse. [But] we have no interaction with one another,\" she said. \"In order to really unlock the potential [of Web3], we're going to need to figure out a system where there's interoperability. What you have goes with you wherever you are, [and] we're not there yet,\" Zuckerberg added.\n\nGoing mainstream\n\nHowever, according to Zuckerberg, that's easier said than done because no company running a metaverse right now wants to give up control or \"share that ownership.\" \"That's why it's not we're not seeing that kind of consumer mainstream adoption yet because there needs to be a world where you leave the house with one wallet. And you need to see that same behavior online also.\" She added that Web3 needs experts who have been involved in the global banking system and Web2 \u2014 the internet that we know today \u2014 to lend a \"protective layer.\"\n\nThe need for such experts is all the more important because it has been \"too easy\" for users to be scammed or lose all their assets in Web3, said Zuckerberg. \"There needs to be more protections for consumers \u2026 I think we will wind up [with] web 2.7, where there is some centralization, keeping people safe, but the ability to port your assets with you to any site.\" Another thing that needs to be improved in Web3 is user-friendliness, she added. \"It should not take 45 steps to set up a cryptocurrency wallet, buy a currency and enter the metaverse. It needs to [be] one-stop, beginner-friendly.\"\n\nSectors with opportunities",

Homebuyers are facing a worsening affordability situation with mortgage rates hovering around the highest levels in more than a decade.\n\nMortgage balances rose 1.9% for the quarter, or $207 billion, to about $11.4 trillion, even though the pace of originations moved lower. That annual increase marked a 9.1% gain from a year ago as home prices exploded during the pandemic era.\n\n\"Americans are borrowing more, but a big part of the increased borrowing is attributable to higher prices,\" the New York Fed said in a blog post accompanying the release.\n\nThe collective American IOU totaled $16.15 trillion through the end of June, good for a $312 billion \u2014 or 2% \u2014 increase from the previous quarter. Debt gains were widespread but particularly focused on mortgages and vehicle purchases.\n\nHousehold debt climbed past $16 trillion in the second quarter for the first time, as soaring inflation pushed up housing and auto balances, the New York Federal Reserve reported Tuesday.\n\nCredit card balances surged $46 billion in the three-month period and 13% over the past year, which Fed researchers said was the largest gain in more than 20 years. Non-housing credit balances increased 2.4% from the first quarter, the biggest gain since 2016.\n\nStudent loan debt was little changed at $1.59 trillion.\n\nThe increase in borrowing comes with inflation running at an 8.6% annual rate in the second quarter that included a 9.1% increase in June \u2014 the biggest move since November 1981 \u2014 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Shelter inflation rose at a 5.5% annual rate in June and new and used vehicle prices were up 11.4% and 7.1% respectively.\n\nIn response to the elevated inflation levels, the Fed has raised interest rates four times in 2022, with the increases totaling 2.25 percentage points. Those moves in turn have pushed up 30-year mortgage rates to 5.41%, up more than 2 percentage points from the beginning of the year, according to Freddie Mac.\n\nDespite the rising debt and inflation levels and higher interest rates, delinquency rates remained relatively benign.\n\n\"Although debt balances are growing rapidly, households in general have weathered the pandemic remarkably well, due in no small part to the expansive programs put in place to support them,\" the Fed blog post said. \"Further, household debt is held overwhelmingly by higher-score borrowers, even more so now than it has been in the history of our data.\"\n\nThrough June, some 2.7% of outstanding debt was in delinquency, nearly 2 percentage points lower than the first quarter of 2020 as the nation was entering the Covid pandemic.\n\nFed economists noted that delinquency rates were nudging higher for subprime borrowers at the lower end of the credit scale.",

Separations also edged lower, falling by 1.4% to 5.93 million.\n\nFederal Reserve officials watch the JOLTS numbers closely as they assess the future path of the labor market and how that might influence interest rates. The Fed has enacted four interest rate increases this year totaling 2.25 percentage points in an effort to control inflation that has run at its fastest rate since November 1981.\n\nNonfarm payrolls rose by 372,000 in June and the unemployment rate held at 3.6%. July's numbers will be out Friday, with economists surveyed by Dow Jones are looking for an increase of 258,000.",
