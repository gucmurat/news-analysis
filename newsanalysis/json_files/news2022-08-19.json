She found herself beaten by investors willing to pay cash far above the listing price, and buy sight unseen in gameshow-like bidding wars.\n\nThe 496-sq-ft condo was one of the very few Austin homes she could still afford as prices soared in January. Her offer put her among the finalists, but at the last minute, the seller threw a new curveball: the other bidders had signed an appraisal waiver. Hawkins needed more cash she didn\u2019t have, so she \u201cbowed out\u201d.\n\nAcross the US, many have faced similar roadblocks: prices popped as a confluence of forces suppressed supply and inflated demand, leaving many middle- and lower-income buyers with a dwindling number of housing options, or forcing them into rentership.\n\nSamantha Hawkins at her apartment in Austin. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\nNow, with interest rates rising and the housing market cooling, things are supposed to be different. So far they aren\u2019t. Nationally, house prices hit an all-time high in June of $416,000, up 13.4% from a year ago.\n\nThe challenges Austin buyers are still experiencing show just how difficult the dream of owning your own home has become for a broad swath of Americans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked really hard the last year or two and made the right choices financially to try to have a chance, but it seems like I can\u2019t really win in this market,\u201d Hawkins said.\n\nThe problems plaguing tight markets nationally have all hit Austin. Hawkins is competing with investors who now account for more than 30% of single-family home sales, Airbnb operators and any number of the about 125 people moving to Austin daily amid dizzying job growth. Meanwhile, builders haven\u2019t kept pace with demand and zoning laws limit new multifamily housing that could provide relief.\n\nMay\u2019s median sale prices in Austin and surrounding Travis county hit new peaks of $676,000 and $625,000, respectively \u2013 up from around $400,000 just before the pandemic. That\u2019s put pressure on the rental market, pushing the median rent above $2,700 and fueling displacement.\n\nAnd even though Austin\u2019s June home inventory doubled over the prior year as interest rate hikes cooled demand, supply is only increasing for the wealthiest buyers.\n\nThe portion of national listings that someone earning $75,000 annually could afford dropped from 40% to 25% between January and June as home prices and mortgage rates climbed, National Association of Realtors\u2019 (NAR) data shows.\n\n\u201cThe higher inventory is promising, but not for middle- and lower-income groups,\u201d said Nadia Evangelou, an economist with NAR.\n\nThere\u2019s some evidence of that on the ground. Austin realtor Sherry LeBlanc, who focuses on finding homes for first-time buyers, recently listed a house that could have fetched $515,000 last year for $435,000 with the expectation that middle-income buyers would snap it up. Instead, showings were slow and only investors bid.\n\n\u201cFamilies are scared off by interest rates,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say, \u2018Well, shit, that\u2019s out of my budget.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor those like Hawkins stuck in rentership, the crisis hits on a financial level. Homeownership is a key instrument for wealth building and security, and loss of access to it represents a \u201cbreach of the social contract\u201d, said Austin realtor Socar Chatmon-Thomas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pissing me off because somebody who went to school, got a degree, or otherwise did everything right and now has a job making $60,000 can\u2019t buy a home,\u201d she said.\n\nInvestor demand\n\nEven with a six-figure tech salary, Courtney McKinley couldn\u2019t buy in the city. The parks, restaurants, pools and friends that attracted her to a rental in Austin\u2019s Zilker neighborhood were off the table as the lowest house prices had inched toward $1m.\n\nBut even as she looked around the city\u2019s edge and suburbs, she couldn\u2019t top the cash offers. A $350,000 bid on an over 40-year-old townhouse that \u201cneeded some help\u201d was beaten by an investor who offered $50,000 more in cash. Weeks later, she lost on a dilapidated townhome despite including a $50,000 escalation clause. The next month, an offer $30,000 over asking price on a sun-filled, three-bedroom home that felt perfect was turned down. \u201cThat was a heartbreak moment. I cried after that one,\u201d McKinley said.\n\nAfter more dead ends, she finally won with a $400,000 bid for a two-bedroom that needed a new kitchen, patio, floors and other improvements. It\u2019s in Pflugerville, a sprawling suburb of strip malls and big box stores that\u2019s in a \u201ckind of isolating\u201d location, McKinley said. Ultimately, however, she says she feels lucky: friends have put in up to 15 offers and still don\u2019t have a house.\n\nA new housing development under construction in Pflugerville, Texas. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\n\u201cIt was a rollercoaster, but no matter how difficult and frustrating it was, at least I\u2019m building equity now,\u201d she said.\n\nFor middle-class Austinites like McKinley being outbid by cash offers in Austin, this much feels clear: investors are part of the problem.\n\nWhile some argue the percentage of investor-owned single family purchases nationally remains low, tight \u201csun belt\u201d markets like metro Austin have seen it double from about 15% throughout the mid-2010s to over 30% in 2022\u2019s first quarter. And investors often target the type of homes that middle-income earners like McKinley are seeking, as well as those in lower-income, minority neighborhoods\n\n\u201cInvestors are not focused on the higher end of the market,\u201d said Georgia Tech urban planning professor Elora Lee Raymond. \u201cIt\u2019s entry-level homes that are being snapped up and are incredibly difficult to purchase at this time.\u201d\n\nBeyond having the resources to place higher bids and pay with cash, investors often buy homes sight unseen, and typically skip appraisals and inspections. Some companies also use algorithms to place bids within hours of homes being listed, and Wall Street-backed institutional investors are viewed as particularly problematic.\n\nThe five largest private equity buyers added 76,000 homes to their portfolio between March 2018 and September 2021, and their model has been derided by critics as \u201cindustrial housing\u201d as they maximize profits by raising rents and skimping on maintenance.\n\nA June US House committee investigation highlighting private equity\u2019s role in local housing crises noted corporate landlords in Atlanta were up to 205 times more likely to evict tenants, and increased rents by an average of 37-57% within a year of purchasing properties.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s virtually impossible to quantify how much investors are pushing up home prices, and the situation is a \u201cchicken and egg\u201d question, said Thom Malone, an economist for real estate data analyst CoreLogic.\n\nA new home, right, towers over residences on the same street in the Montopolis neighborhood in south-east Austin. Photograph: Jordan Vonderhaar/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n\u201cWhere investors go, prices go up, but to what extent is this because the prices were going up because demand increased?\u201d Malone asked. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a bit of both.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, another breed of investor is depleting stock in tourist-friendly areas: short-term rental operators. Though the city says Airbnb owners operate about 3,000 units, housing advocate Inside Airbnb gleaned the company\u2019s listings and found about 12,000, including 10,000 whole home units. And that accounts for one company \u2013 the true number of short-term rentals is probably much higher.\n\nIn one east Austin neighborhood, Airbnb in June controlled about 12% of the housing units, Inside Airbnb found. While about 270 units were available for long-term rent during a 2020 US census survey, more than 1,300 whole home units were available on Airbnb in June.\n\n\u201cEven without some economic researcher looking into it, common sense tells you that these are entire apartments that are no longer available, and people will be directly or indirectly displaced,\u201d said Inside Airbnb founder Murray Cox.\n\nShort supply\n\nThe signs of a construction boom are evident across Travis county, the fifth-most populous county in Texas. Along the metro region\u2019s edges, new neighborhoods and strip malls are multiplying, while closer to the city core in south Austin, expensive new condo buildings have sprouted among the old restaurants, strip malls and pawn shops on Congress Avenue.\n\nCars sit parked outside Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory on the east side of Austin. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\nThough Austin has grown at an exceptional clip for decades, the recent population spike is partly driven by tech: Oracle, Tesla, Meta, HP Enterprise and many more have relocated or opened offices here. That\u2019s coupled with demand from New York and California buyers who relocated during the pandemic, and millennials entering the market.\n\nMonthly new construction home closures in Austin in 2021 were up by 53% from pre-pandemic highs, CoreLogic data shows, but the city is struggling to build its way out of the crisis: supply chain squeezes and labor shortages observers pin on Trump\u2019s immigration policies have slowed the construction cycle.\n\n\u201cSupply is a tortoise and demand is a gazelle, so when there\u2019s a sudden increase in demand, it takes years for new supply to come on the market, and in the meantime there\u2019s this huge surge in prices,\u201d said Jake Wegmann, a University of Texas regional planning professor.\n\nA recent proposal to overhaul Austin\u2019s zoning ordinance would have allowed for more apartment buildings, increased the number of townhomes and simplified the approval process. The changes would allow the city to build \u201cthousands more units\u201d annually, but Nimby-ism and anti-growth forces shut it down, Wegmann said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to make it sound like this would\u2019ve solved everything, but we\u2019re really tying our own hand behind our back,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2018I pray every night\u2019\n\nPaola Valdez-Lopez cleans while her kids, Alycia, five, and Matias, six, eat dinner in Austin. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\nSoaring home prices ultimately create pressure lower in the market, hitting the city\u2019s most vulnerable the hardest. Six months ago, Paola Valdez and her husband made the last $500 payment on their three-bedroom trailer set in a south Austin mobile home park. The extra money was welcome as the couple raised two young kids, and they were proud to own the home outright.\n\nBut everything changed in early July. The California investor who recently purchased the Congress Mobile Home Park handed 60-day eviction notices to its residents, and leaving isn\u2019t easy \u2013 Valdez\u2019s trailer can\u2019t be transported because it\u2019s 30 years old.\n\nA new, smaller trailer is $1,500 a month plus the lot fee, and three-bedroom apartments in her neighborhood top $3,500 a month. The family is at a loss over what it will do next, but Valdez expects her days of staying home to raise the kids are done.\n\n\u201cOne day you\u2019re fine, you\u2019ve paid off your home and you\u2019re making a nest, then all the sudden you\u2019re bombarded with \u2018You\u2019ve got to leave in 60 days\u2019,\u201d Valdez said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to stay strong. I pray every night.\u201d\n\nLeft: A notice of non-renewal of lease for Paola Valdez-Lopez. Right: Edvin Agular embraces his wife, Valdez-Lopez. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\nAs median rent jumped 48% year over year, state records analyzed by the Guardian data show Travis County evictions hit record monthly highs in March and April. That\u2019s partially fueled by investors purchasing apartment buildings with affordable rents and turning them into pricey condos, said Mincho Jacob, a spokesperson with housing advocate Basta Austin.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s destroying the heart of Austin because people with long roots here are evicted and forced out,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are few tools to do anything about it in Texas where the Republican-controlled legislature largely banned rent control, and though housing advocates have had some success in warding off developer purchases of affordable housing, it hasn\u2019t been enough. Similarly, wide-scale displacement continues even though Austin voters since 2018 have approved $550m for affordable housing and anti-displacement measures.\n\nAnother link between the higher home prices and rental pressure is those like Hawkins, who have been shut out of ownership. But with a recent salary increase in her career, she\u2019s regrouping and saving money, and says she\u2019s determined as ever to own.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a goal of mine for a really long time, and since there\u2019s been so many failed attempts, I just want to prove to myself that I can do it,\u201d she said.", "summary": "The 496-sq-ft condo was one of the very few Austin homes she could still afford as prices soared in January.\nThe challenges Austin buyers are still experiencing show just how difficult the dream of owning your own home has become for a broad swath of Americans.\nThe problems plaguing tight markets nationally have all hit Austin.\nThough the city says Airbnb owners operate about 3,000 units, housing advocate Inside Airbnb gleaned the company\u2019s listings and found about 12,000, including 10,000 whole home units.\nIn one east Austin neighborhood, Airbnb in June controlled about 12% of the housing units, Inside Airbnb found."},

{"date": ["2022-08-19"], "title": "'You've got to eat': Energy bills are squeezing businesses and people as UK costs soar", "author": ["Elliot Smith"], "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/19/energy-bills-are-squeezing-businesses-and-people-as-uk-costs-soar.html", "content": "A high street decorated with British Union Jack bunting in Penistone, UK. The End Fuel Poverty Coalition has warned \"a tsunami of fuel poverty will hit the country this winter.\" Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nLONDON \u2014 Facing soaring energy bills, rising costs and rapidly declining consumer purchasing power, small businesses across the U.K. are struggling to make ends meet. New data on Wednesday showed U.K. inflation jumped to a 40-year high of 10.1% in July as food and energy costs continued to soar, exacerbating the country's cost-of-living crisis. The Bank of England expects consumer price inflation to top out at 13.3% in October, with the country's average energy bills (set via a price cap) expected to rise sharply in the fourth quarter to eventually exceed an annual \u00a34,266 ($5,170) in early 2023. On Wednesday, a director of U.K. energy regulator Ofgem quit over its decision to add hundreds of pounds to household bills, accusing the watchdog of failing to strike the \"right balance between the interests of consumers and the interests of suppliers.\" Real wages in the U.K. fell by an annual 3% in the second quarter of 2022, the sharpest decline on record, as wage increases failed to keep pace with the surging cost of living. A new survey published Friday also showed consumer confidence falling to its lowest level since records began in 1974. 'Absolute madness' \"While the energy price caps do not apply to businesses directly, millions of small business owners are still experiencing increased energy bills at a time when costs are rising in most operational areas,\" said Alan Thomas, U.K. CEO at insurance firm Simply Business. \"Simultaneously, consumer purchasing power is going down as Brits cut back on non-essential spending, harming the books of SME [small and medium-sized enterprise] owners.\" This assessment was echoed by Christopher Gammon, e-commerce manager at Lincs Aquatics \u2014 a Lincolnshire-based store and warehouse providing aquariums, ponds and marine livestock. The business has seen its energy costs rise by 90% so far since the war in Ukraine began, Gammon told CNBC on Thursday, and its owners are provisioning for further increases in the coming months.\n\n\"We are combating the rising cost with switching everything to LED, solar panels, wind turbines (planning in process) and closing down unused systems,\" Gammon said. \"We have also had to increase the price of products \u2014 most of these have been livestock as they are now costing more to look after.\" Customers are increasingly withdrawing from keeping fish and reptiles due to the cost of maintenance, and on Wednesday the store had a customer bring in a snake they could no longer afford to care for. The spiraling costs forced Lincs Aquatics to close a store in East Yorkshire, laying off several workers, while trying to offer pay rises to staff at its two remaining locations in Lincolnshire in order to help them through the crisis. The business is also working to expand its online shop due to rising in-store upkeep costs, as heating water for marine aquariums and purchasing pump equipment become ever more expensive. In early July, a quarterly survey from the British Chambers of Commerce found that 82% of businesses in the U.K. saw inflation as a growing concern for their business, with growth in sales, investment intentions and longer-term turnover confidence all slowing.\n\n\"Businesses face an unprecedented convergence of cost pressures, with the main drivers coming from raw materials, fuel, utilities, taxes, and labor,\" said BCC Head of Research David Bharier. \"The continuing supply chain crisis, exacerbated by conflict in Ukraine and lockdowns in China, has further compounded this.\" BCC Director General Shevaun Haviland added that \"the red lights on our economic dashboard are starting to flash,\" with almost every indicator deteriorating since the March survey. Phil Speed, an independent distributor for multiservice company Utility Warehouse, based in Skegness, England, liaises with brokers to find energy deals for business clients. He told CNBC earlier this week that for the first time in 10 years, he had been unable to obtain a better deal for a client than their out-of-contract rate \u2014 the typically expensive rates paid when a business or individual does not have a contracted deal in place. \"I think the unit rate she was quoting was 60p [pence] a unit for gas, which is just ridiculous. I'd imagine a year ago, we'd have been looking at 5 or 6p. It's just absolute madness,\" Speed said. \"We've got no idea what's going to be presented to us, because we've got no idea what's going to happen. The price is just going ballistic. No-one's going to buy it.\" The cost of gas for both businesses and consumers are only expected to increase through the colder winter months. Speed noted that local cafes cooking on gas will likely struggle, as they have no choice but to continue using it, unless they can replace gas appliances with electric ones. 'Scream very loudly at somebody' Rail strikes have already brought the country to a halt on multiple days throughout the summer and look set to continue, while postal workers, telecoms engineers and dock workers have all voted to strike as inflation erodes real wages. Conservative leadership favorite Liz Truss was earlier this month forced into a dramatic U-turn on a plan to cut public sector pay outside London, which would have axed wages for teachers, nurses, police and the armed forces alike. Local authorities recently offered state school support staff a flat pay rise of \u00a31,925 per year, meaning a 10.5% increase for the lowest-paid staff and just over 4% for the highest earners, after pressure from three of the country's largest unions. One woman in her early fifties \u2013 a member of support staff at a state school in Lincolnshire who asked not to be named due to the sensitive situation and concerns on public reprisals \u2013 told CNBC that years of real-terms pay cuts had left many low-paid public sector workers struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe British government in 2010, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, announced a two-year pay freeze for public sector workers, followed by a 1% average cap on public sector pay awards which was lifted in 2017, with average pay rises increasing to roughly 2% by 2020. While the 10.5% rise for the lowest-paid school support staff will ease the pressure, the woman said her energy costs had doubled and her private landlord had attempted to increase her rent by \u00a340 per month, which she had not agreed to and which may mean she would need to sell her car to cover basic living expenses. She called on the government to temporarily reduce the \"standing charge,\" a fixed daily amount households have to pay on most gas and electricity bills no matter how much they actually use, and to up its efforts to recoup one-off \"windfall taxes\" from energy companies such as BP, Shell and Centrica, which are reporting record profits.. \"I think this is an even bigger crisis than [the Covid-19 pandemic], because this is going to affect not just lower earners, but maybe even middle earners as well, because I don't see how anybody can absorb those kinds of energy costs,\" she said.", "summary": "Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLONDON \u2014 Facing soaring energy bills, rising costs and rapidly declining consumer purchasing power, small businesses across the U.K. are struggling to make ends meet.\nNew data on Wednesday showed U.K. inflation jumped to a 40-year high of 10.1% in July as food and energy costs continued to soar, exacerbating the country's cost-of-living crisis.\nOn Wednesday, a director of U.K. energy regulator Ofgem quit over its decision to add hundreds of pounds to household bills, accusing the watchdog of failing to strike the \"right balance between the interests of consumers and the interests of suppliers.\"\n'Absolute madness' \"While the energy price caps do not apply to businesses directly, millions of small business owners are still experiencing increased energy bills at a time when costs are rising in most operational areas,\" said Alan Thomas, U.K. CEO at insurance firm Simply Business.\nThe business has seen its energy costs rise by 90% so far since the war in Ukraine began, Gammon told CNBC on Thursday, and its owners are provisioning for further increases in the coming months."},

Card 1 of 5 Inflation F.A.Q. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. Inflation F.A.Q. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Inflation F.A.Q. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. Inflation F.A.Q. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Inflation F.A.Q. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose market rent increases take time to trickle into official inflation figures because of the way the government calculates its data. Much as Phoenix\u2019s official inflation numbers are surging now partly because of the run-up in market rents in 2021, nascent increases in big coastal cities could keep pressure on inflation in months to come. And the effect could be palpable at a national level: New York and its suburbs account for about 11 percent of the nation\u2019s rental housing-related costs in the Consumer Price Index, compared to about 1 percent for Phoenix.\n\n\u201cEven if we get a slowdown in the Sun Belt, it may not be enough to offset what we\u2019re seeing in other markets,\u201d said Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights.\n\nFederal Reserve officials noted that risk at their July meeting, according to minutes released Wednesday, observing that \u201cin some product categories, the rate of price increase could well pick up further in the short run, with sizable additional increases in residential rental expenses being especially likely.\u201d\n\nThe Fed has been raising interest rates since March to try to slow consumer and business demand and cool inflation and is expected to lift them again at its meeting in September.\n\nTo date, much of the regional divide in price increases \u2014 from rents to consumer goods and services \u2014 has traced back to migration.

Rather than raking in fixed fees, Kraus' $3.8 billion firm operates on a fee structure linked to performance, charging 30 percent of alpha. That's higher than the industry standard but since inception, about half of Aperture's funds have delivered alpha above their benchmarks. Kraus sat down with CNBC's Delivering Alpha newsletter to explain why he's focused on a pay-for-performance set-up and how he's putting capital to work in the current environment.\n\n(The below has been edited for length and clarity. See above for full video.)\n\nLeslie Picker: What do you see as the key problem with the traditional model? And what do you think is the best way to fix it?\n\nPeter Kraus: The key problem is very simple. The existing model in almost all cases, rewards people whether or not they perform. So, it's a fixed fee and as assets grow, you earn more money. Well, clients don't actually hire us to grow our assets, they hire us to perform. So, you would think the performance fee or the actual fee would be connected to the performance as opposed to the asset growth. We also know that asset growth is the enemy of performance. It's harder and harder to perform, the more assets that you manage. So, the fee doesn't help you - that traditional fee doesn't help in that regard, because the manager is incentivized to continue to grow assets, and that makes it harder and harder to perform.\n\nOf course, there are performance fees in the marketplace and hedge funds and private equity, but they also have rather large management fees. So, they too have some incentive to grow their assets. Basically Aperture is the anathema to that - it's the opposite. We charge a very low base fee that's equal to the ETF and then we only charge if we beat the index. So, you pay for performance. If we don't have any performance, you pay what you pay to buy the ETF.\n\nPicker: So, then how do you choose which index is relevant for the specific strategies?. I mean, do you invest in certain ways that would mirror or would be comparable to certain indexes that you're able to then outperform?\n\nKraus: Exactly. So, we're very, very thoughtful about the index because we're actually charging people to beat the index. So, for example, in global equities, we would use the MSCI global equity index. For U.S. small cap, we would use the Russell 2000. For European equities, we would use the Euro Stoxx Index. Very simple indices, not complex, no real question about whether the manager is actually creating a portfolio that is following that index. In fact, we actually test the correlation of the portfolio to the index to make sure the index continues to be relevant.\n\nPicker: People who advocate for their management fee will say that it's necessary, essentially, to keep the lights on - that it basically ensures that the operations of the fund can meet all of their fixed costs and cover their expenses. How are you able to do so with a lower management fee?\n\nKraus: People say, well, I need to keep the lights on. Well, okay, how many assets do you need to keep the lights on? And once you have the lights on, then do you need to keep charging the fixed fee? Because your incentive is just to continue to gather assets. So, it's really a function of how many assets we have and we've created a company where we think that assets scale pretty much speaks for revenues to cover the fixed expenses. And then the rest is only earned if we perform. One of the things that I like about Aperture is that I'm incentivized, as the owner of the business identically with the client. I don't make much money, if any money, unless we actually perform.\n\nPicker: What about your ability to recruit and pay employees? Does it have any bearing on compensation?\n\nKraus: Sure does. The portfolio managers are paid a strict percentage of the performance fee. So, portfolio managers are usually paid 35% of the 30% that we charge. We charge a 30% performance fee and we pay the management, to the portfolio managers and their team, 35% of that. And we've selected that percentage because we think that that is highly competitive with both the hedge fund industry as well as the long-only industry. And if managers perform on the amount of capital that they have, their compensation can be quite attractive. And that's, in effect, how we believe we can attract some of the best talent in the marketplace.\n\nPicker: It doesn't appear though, at least in the current environment, that LPs are too dissuaded by the traditional model. I mean, there were nearly 200 hedge fund launches in Q1 outpacing the number of liquidations. AUM stands around $4 trillion for the hedge fund industry overall. So, it doesn't appear that LPS have really been pushing back, at least in terms of new launches and total AUM size. So, I'm just curious kind of what your conversations have been like on that front?\n\nKraus: Well, there's $4 trillion in the hedge fund community but there's $32 trillion in the long-only community. And I don't think that it's a question that is hard to answer. If you look at the trend between the active management industry and the passive industry, money's been moving to the passive industry at a rapid pace - unchanged for 10 years. And the hedge fund space, the $4 trillion - we're talking about all sorts of different types of hedge funds, for sure, it's not a monolithic industry. But essentially, most managers or most allocators that I speak to would rather not pay a performance fee times the beta that their money is exposed to. They would like to pay a performance fee for actually the performance. And so, we offer that clarity, which many hedge funds do not. And in the long-only space, there's virtually no payment for performance. It's almost all fixed.\n\nPicker: Since there's so much on the line with regard to performance, I have to ask you, what's your strategy? What's your what's your thinking right now? How are you putting capital to work in the current environment in a way that you believe will outperform the benchmarks?\n\nKraus: It depends upon the strategy, whether it's an equity strategy or fixed income strategy. But in the equity strategies, we are what you would expect - highly research dependent, looking for specific opportunities with companies that we think have long term growth, or undervalue and will accelerate their value over time. And that timeframe is usually 18 months to three years. In the credit space, again, it's fundamental research to find credits and obviously being careful about the market because credit markets tend to be more macro driven. But it's all of the above and that's what we spend our time doing. We think that if we do that consistently over time, we can perform.\n\nPicker: Are you net long or net short in the current environment?\n\nKraus: Interestingly enough, in the one hedge fund that we do run, we're pretty close to flat. So, I would say a very low net position. In the other funds that we run, we run 100% long. So, in other words, we are what I call beta one, exposed to the index by 100%. But we do have shorts, so we're gross more than 100% in those funds. But I would say in general, right now, our risk positions are low.\n\nPicker: So, not much leverage then?\n\nKraus: Not much leverage, but more importantly, the actual stocks and bonds that we are choosing and the positions we're taking, we're on, I would say, the low end of our risk scale.", "summary": "And we've selected that percentage because we think that that is highly competitive with both the hedge fund industry as well as the long-only industry.\nI mean, there were nearly 200 hedge fund launches in Q1 outpacing the number of liquidations.\nAUM stands around $4 trillion for the hedge fund industry overall.\nKraus: Well, there's $4 trillion in the hedge fund community but there's $32 trillion in the long-only community.\nKraus: Interestingly enough, in the one hedge fund that we do run, we're pretty close to flat."},

She leaves her debit card at home when she does her weekly food shop, bringing only the budget she has allocated in notes. As a result, Thomas could \u201csit here and tell you to the penny\u201d what most items in the supermarket cost. \u201cI know that if I go to Aldi something would cost me 6p less than if I went to Asda and about 5p less than if I went to Tesco,\u201d she says. Thomas\u2019s \u201csolid money\u201d habit hasn\u2019t just changed her attitude to Starbucks; it\u2019s changed the way she spends and saves entirely.\n\nResearch shows that we experience the \u2018pain of paying\u2019 when spending cash. Photograph: georgeclerk/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nThomas is not the only one turning to cash during the cost of living crisis. In July, more than \u00a3800m in banknotes was withdrawn from Post Office counters, a 20% rise from the same month the year before. Martin Kearsley, banking director at the Post Office, told the BBC: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more people increasingly reliant on cash as the tried-and-tested way to manage a budget.\u201d\n\nSince records began five years ago, Post Office withdrawals have exceeded \u00a3800m only once before \u2013 and that was last Christmas, a time when a lot of cash is tucked into cards. Shortly after UK wages fell at their fastest rate in 20 years, Kearsley said it was clear that Britain is \u201canything but a cashless society\u201d.\n\nThomas first ditched her debit card post-lockdown after she was troubled by her online spending during the pandemic, but she says her cash-only budget is helping her to prepare for rising costs. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m ahead of the game, I feel like I\u2019ve got an advantage,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be tricky, but I feel like I\u2019ve already got lots of tools in place to help me.\u201d\n\nContactless promotes increased spending and increased use of debt Warwick business school\n\nPersonal finance and consumer expert Sue Hayward concurs that \u201chanding over cold hard cash often makes you think twice about how much you\u2019re spending\u201d. She also notes that it\u2019s easier to keep track of purchases when paying with banknotes, \u201cas contactless payments can take several days to show up on your statement\u201d.\n\nIn 2020, researchers from Warwick business school analysed more than 300m transactions from 260,000 consumers and found that people with contactless cards spent \u201csignificantly more\u201d than those without. Contactless spenders were also more likely to be charged overdraft fees and made more purchases overall. The researchers concluded that contactless: \u201cpromotes increased spending and can promote decreased cash usage and increased use of debt.\u201d\n\nConversely, almost 30 years of academic research have shown that we experience the \u201cpain of paying\u201d when spending cash: handing over money feels like losing it, activating the insular cortex, the part of our brain that deals with physical pain. (Interestingly, it seems that some alternatives to cash are less painful than others. One 2018 paper, from the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, found that consumers feel lower levels of pain when they pay with mobile phones and smartwatches than when they use credit cards.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just being savvy and going back to old-school ways,\u201d Thomas says of her cash use. On her YouTube channel, The Budget Mum UK, she shows her 2,600 subscribers how she withdraws her wage at the start of the month and separates the notes into different laminated envelopes. Among others, there\u2019s an envelope for food shopping, one for travel, one for credit card debt and one for emergencies.\n\nOld-style budgeting \u2026 \u2018cash stuffing\u2019 involves setting aside money in envelopes, one for each expense.

Google searches for the technique spiked at the beginning of the year, and TikTok videos hashtagged #cashstuffing have now accumulated almost 550m views.\n\nJade Edmondson is a 29-year-old teaching assistant from Coventry who sells cash-stuffing materials such as labelled plastic envelopes, binders and savings tracking sheets on her Etsy page. She says she has seen a recent rise in sales. In total, Edmondson personally uses 30 cash-stuffing envelopes for things such as petrol money, Christmas savings and her Slimming World membership. Putting away money gradually in one envelope over the course of the year helps Edmondson save for bigger costs: she now has \u00a3350 saved to buy her four children\u2019s school uniforms. \u201cIf this was me last year, I would be panicking: \u2018How am I going to pay for all of this?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cWhereas actually now, I don\u2019t worry about money.\u201d\n\nYet a cash-only lifestyle can cause problems in an increasingly cashless society. In 2010, half of the UK\u2019s transactional payments were made in cash, but by 2020, this had dropped to just 17%. A number of shops banned cash payments for public health reasons during the pandemic, but a 2021 survey by Which? found that one in five consumers had been prevented from making a cash payment between April and July of 2021, when restrictions were easing.\n\nThe reality is you will pay more using cash because you can\u2019t shop online Natalie Cenney\n\nThomas has run into trouble when paying for petrol \u2013 and when she sent her daughter to the cinema with cash recently, she was unable to buy her ticket and snacks. \u201cIt\u2019s just been trial and error,\u201d she says. Six weeks ago, she decided to set up Apple Pay on her phone as a backup for emergencies, but she refuses to leave her credit card in her car to avoid temptation.\n\nNatalie Ceeney, chair of the Cash Action Group, says many small businesses don\u2019t accept cash because it\u2019s increasingly difficult to deposit takings due to the closure of high street banks. Ceeney is now campaigning to get ATMs to take cash deposits (you can currently do this inside banks, but opening hours can be prohibitive). However, she says, \u201csetting up a whole new network\u201d is \u201cnot quick\u201d. Meanwhile, Ceeney notes that many consumers depend on cash due to \u201csome form of vulnerability\u201d, such as not having a proper internet connection, smartphone or bank account, or having a disability. A May study by the Royal Society of Arts found that 15 million people in the UK rely on cash to budget.\n\n\u201cThe main reason people will tell you they use cash is for budgeting: you can see it, you can feel it,\u201d Ceeney says. \u201cWith the cost of living crisis, more people are strapped for cash so it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that people are going back to using cash, withdrawing money to get through the week safely without getting overdrawn.\u201d\n\nAlthough cash can have its advantages, Ceeney warns that there\u2019s a \u201cpoverty premium\u201d when avoiding cards. \u201cThe reality is, if you can\u2019t shop online you will pay more using cash because you can\u2019t get online deals or direct debits where you often get a discount, you can\u2019t shop around or buy in bulk,\u201d she says. Ceeney explains that although many families know this, they\u2019re \u201cgoing back to cash because they can\u2019t afford to go overdrawn \u2013 this is about necessity\u201d.\n\nEven with cash-stuffing systems in place, Thomas and Edmondson are concerned about the ever-increasing cost of living. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s going to be a big hurdle,\u201d Thomas says of rising bills, while Edmondson adds: \u201cIt\u2019s still very nerve-racking. It\u2019s like: \u2018Where are we going to find this extra money from?\u2019\u201d While using cash can be helpful for individual consumers, it is not a substitute for government intervention, nor a long-term solution to our economic crisis. With food prices rising at their fastest pace in 14 years and annual energy bills expected to cost two months\u2019 worth of wages next year, coins can only go so far.\n\nAdditional reporting by Rachel Hall", "summary": "\u201cWhen you\u2019re physically handing over solid money,\u201d she says, \u201cit just makes you think twice.\u201dFor the last 12 months, Thomas has been a cash-only consumer.\nAs a result, Thomas could \u201csit here and tell you to the penny\u201d what most items in the supermarket cost.\nResearch shows that we experience the \u2018pain of paying\u2019 when spending cash.\nPhotograph: georgeclerk/Getty Images/iStockphotoThomas is not the only one turning to cash during the cost of living crisis.\nEven with cash-stuffing systems in place, Thomas and Edmondson are concerned about the ever-increasing cost of living."},

Eccles Federal Reserve Building, photographed on Wednesday, July 27, 2022 in Washington, DC. Kent Nishimura | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Reserve's path to bringing down runaway inflation while keeping the economy from slipping into a major downturn is still open but is getting narrower, according to Goldman Sachs. As the central bank looks to keep raising interest rates, the economy is teeming with mixed signals: rapidly rising payroll figures against sharply declining housing numbers, falling gasoline prices vs. surging shelter and food costs, and low consumer sentiment against steady spending numbers. Amid it all, the Fed is trying to strike a balance between slowing things down, but not by too much. On that score, Goldman economists think there have been clear wins, some losses and a landscape ahead that poses substantial challenges. \"Our broad conclusion is that there is a feasible but difficult path to a soft landing, though several factors beyond the Fed's control can ease or complicate that path and raise or lower the odds of success,\" Goldman economist David Mericle said in a client note Sunday.\n\nSlow growth, high inflation\n\nOne of the biggest inflation drivers has been outsized growth that has created imbalances between supply and demand. The Fed is using interest rate increases to try to damp down demand so supply can catch up, and supply chain pressures, as measured by a New York Fed index, are at their lowest since January 2021. So on that score, Mericle said the Fed's efforts have \"gone well.\" He said the rate increases \u2014 totaling 2.25 percentage points since March \u2014 have \"achieved a much-need deceleration\" regarding growth and specifically demand. In fact, Goldman expects GDP to grow at just a 1% pace over the next four quarters, and that's coming off consecutive declines of 1.6% and 0.9%. Though most economists expect that the National Bureau of Economic Research will not declare the U.S. in recession for the first half of the year, the slow-growth path makes the Fed's balancing act more difficult. On a similar count, Mericle said the Fed's moves have helped narrow the supply-demand gap in the labor market, where there are still nearly two job openings for every available worker. That effort \"has a long way to go,\" he wrote. However, the biggest problem remains stubbornly high inflation. The consumer price index was flat in July but still rose 8.5% from a year ago. Wages are surging at a strong clip, with average hourly earnings up 5.2% from a year ago. Consequently, the Fed's efforts to halt a spiral in which higher prices feed higher wages and perpetuate inflation have \"shown little convincing progress so far,\" Mericle said. \"The bad news is that high inflation is broad-based, measures of the underlying trend are elevated, and business inflation expectations and pricing intentions remain high,\" he added.\n\nDoubts about the Fed's policy path\n\nFighting inflation might require higher rate hikes than the market currently anticipates. Goldman's projection is that the Fed raises benchmark rates by another percentage point before the end of the year, but Mericle acknowledged that there is \"upside risk\" due to \"the recent easing in financial conditions, the robust pace of hiring, and signs of stickiness in wage growth and inflation.\" Indeed, former New York Fed President William Dudley said Monday he thinks the market is underestimating the future path of rate hikes and, consequently, the risks of a hard landing or recession.", "summary": "Amid it all, the Fed is trying to strike a balance between slowing things down, but not by too much.\nSlow growth, high inflationOne of the biggest inflation drivers has been outsized growth that has created imbalances between supply and demand.\nHowever, the biggest problem remains stubbornly high inflation.\n\"The bad news is that high inflation is broad-based, measures of the underlying trend are elevated, and business inflation expectations and pricing intentions remain high,\" he added.\nDoubts about the Fed's policy pathFighting inflation might require higher rate hikes than the market currently anticipates."},

You need not be an economist to know how much prices have been going up this year, from the petrol pump to the supermarket checkout to direct debits. And while inflation at 10% is a remarkable figure, it is set to go even higher. Unless the government acts on energy bills, when the cap rises by a predicted 80% on 1 October, inflation will soar again. Analysts expect prices for gas and electricity to keep on increasing well into the new year. And where energy prices go, so go the costs for everything else, from food to clothes to transport.\n\nThe UK is not the only country in this mess, but its position is the most precarious of any in the rich world. Privatisation means that the British government has little control over the prices set by its utilities (unlike, say, Emmanuel Macron with EDF), while workers in the UK have far less bargaining power than their counterparts in France and Germany. Then there is Brexit, plus the long-held assumption by politicians and economists that the UK need neither own nor manufacture much of what it consumes \u2013 it can just buy it all in. The result is that inflation in the UK far outstrips that in the US, Japan, Germany or France \u2013 and financial markets expect that to remain so next year.\n\nEven before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, 2022 was set to be shaped by the cost of living. Ahead of this autumn, three things can be said with reasonable confidence. First, the Bank of England will keep raising rates \u2013 and most likely induce a recession that will harm firms and workers. Threadneedle Street will treat this week\u2019s signs of prices rising in the service sector as proof that inflation is no longer being imported, but is now settling into our economy. Second, the next prime minister will not have the war chest they hoped for. This March, the Office for Budget Responsibility calculated that the Conservative government had \u00a330bn of \u201cfiscal headroom\u201d to cut taxes and raise spending. Most of that will now go on pensions, social security and interest on public debt. Throughout this Tory leadership campaign, economics has been discussed as if in some strange blue-rinse bubble: giveaways today, or tomorrow? That bubble is heading towards a painfully sharp pin.\n\nFinally, the Conservatives are engineering an almighty clash with trade unions. Public sector workers are the ones seeing their pay fall furthest behind their bills, after more than a decade of real-terms cuts to wages, and are also most likely to be unionised. The government is well aware of this, yet has done little to alleviate the real suffering being felt by nurses and teachers and other vital workers. The obvious conclusion to be drawn is ministers want a fight. If so, they won\u2019t be disappointed. Given the battle readiness of union leaders such as Sharon Graham, this will most probably be a winter dominated by industrial strife.\n\nIt is worth recalling how much of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s project focused on suppressing prices by hammering down on workers.

If you\u2019re less wealthy than Jacob Rees-Mogg, the party has fought a 12-year war against you, and \u2013 newsflash \u2013 it won.\n\nSome statistics need animating, and some animate themselves. We do not need a human-interest case study to understand what a 40-year high of 10.1% inflation feels like. We don\u2019t need a pessimistic temperament to be terrified of what October will look like, when it\u2019s slated to reach 13% and the choice between heating and eating kicks in for so many people. We don\u2019t need an infographic to get to grips with the official figures that show a 4.1% drop in regular pay. But news that the Dogs Trust, for the first time in its history, has a waiting list for taking in people\u2019s pets still takes your breath away. I\u2019m emphatically not saying that dogs are more important than people \u2013 I\u2019m merely pointing out that this government has brought us to a point where we can\u2019t afford to feed our best friends. This isn\u2019t a belt-tightening moment; this is a wake-up moment.\n\nIn fact, the class war wasn\u2019t fought with subtlety and skill, it was fought in a more modern fashion, with misinformation. The argument for austerity was built on complementary, nonsensical narratives: most disabled people were faking it; most people on benefits were too lazy to work; most waste in the benefits system was lost to fraud; a class of the workshy had been created by benefits; the \u201cbig society\u201d was good, because it was much nicer to get your neighbour\u2019s help than to have properly funded public services; parents know more about education than local authorities; and so on.\n\nOpponents of this Cameron-era inanity dignified it by arguing against these propositions as though he actually meant them. What if libraries were mainly used by middle-class children? What if nurses did have to take a pay cut, or we\u2019d soon become Greece? It was just one diversionary talking point after another, as the first offensive wave proceeded completely without mishap, and the destruction of the social safety net was achieved.\n\nWith Brexit, at least we were arguing about something real: what happened in relation to Europe mattered, for our prosperity, for our intellectual life, for our rights, for the union, for the climate. But again, we were arguing from a completely false start, as if the two competing sides were legitimately different visions for Britain, one which wanted to take back control, one which didn\u2019t. In fact, the escapade was there to deliver only one outcome: the destruction of regulation by which workers and citizens protect and assert themselves against the interests of capital. It was just the second wave of the war.\n\nLiz Truss and Rishi Sunak, prime ministerial hopefuls, approach the coming crisis with another patchwork of absolute nonsense. The cost of living crisis is all down to the war in Ukraine. We head into recession because we don\u2019t work hard enough. It\u2019s all the fault of the unions, or the woke, who are coming for our growth and \u201cour women\u201d (respectively). Britain can go from strength to strength if the person in charge is enthusiastic enough (according to Truss). This time it\u2019s different \u2013 these lines are so incredibly weak and thin, it\u2019s like reaching the end of the road in a Russian misinformation campaign, where they can no longer afford any tech whizzes and they\u2019re leaving meme creation to bots and Google translate.\n\nBut it\u2019s different for a more important reason: they\u2019re not trying to divert us from some smart new move \u2013 they have no moves. If you look at the level of public debt, the high inflation, the low growth and the tax burden, we\u2019re already in a postwar economy. It was just a different kind of war, a class war masquerading as a kulturkampf, and we lost. Sorry to labour the point, but until we acknowledge the extent of the devastation and its cause we cannot hope to recover our bearings.\n\nYou cannot rebuild anything on fictional foundations. There is no meaningful way out of this if we pretend it\u2019s all about global headwinds and we\u2019re a nice nation that can pull together. You cannot organise if you don\u2019t know what side you\u2019re on, and so many of the narratives of the past 12 years have been tailored to mask exactly that. Are you a striver or a shirker? A net contributor or a net recipient? A patriot or a migrant? Metropolitan elite or left behind? Latte sipper or bitter drinker? Woke or anti-woke? Leaver or remainer?

Pictured here in Guangxi, China, on Aug. 15, 2022, is a real estate complex developed by state-owned conglomerate Poly Group. Future Publishing | Future Publishing | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Chinese property developers' cash flows \u2014 a sign of the companies' ability to stay afloat \u2014 shrank this year after steady growth over the last decade, according to Oxford Economics. Developer cash flows through July are down 24% year-on-year on an annualized basis, according to analysis from the firm's lead economist, Tommy Wu. That's a sharp slowdown from growth for nearly every year since at least 2009, the data showed. Total funding as of July was 15.22 trillion yuan ($2.27 trillion) on an annualized basis, versus 20.11 trillion yuan in 2021. The drop comes as credit demand in China missed expectations in July, and property developers' struggles drag on. About two years ago, Beijing started to crack down on developers' high reliance on debt for growth. Notably, Evergrande defaulted late last year. Other developers like Shimao have also defaulted, despite appearing to have healthier balance sheets.\n\nWhile investors have turned cautious on Chinese property companies, developers now face the risk of losing another important source of cash flow: homebuyer pre-payments.\n\nHomes are typically sold ahead of completion in China. But since late June, some homebuyers have protested apartment construction delays by halting mortgage payments. \"The crux of the problem is that property developers have insufficient cash flows \u2013 whether because of debt-servicing costs, low housing sales, or misuse of funds \u2013 to continue with projects,\" Wu said in a report last week. \"Resolving this problem will rebuild homebuyers' confidence in developers, which will help support housing sales and, in turn, improve developers' financial health.\" More than $2 billion in high-yield property developer debt is due in September \u2014 that's more than two times that of August, according to Morgan Stanley's analysis as of Aug. 10. About a quarter of homebuyers who bought property ahead of their completion are inclined to stop their mortgage payments if construction is suspended, the U.S. investment bank said in an Aug. 15 report, citing a proprietary AlphaWise Consumer Survey. Not only does real estate account for the bulk of household wealth in China, but analysts estimate property and industries related to real estate account for more than a quarter of China's GDP. The real estate slump has contributed to an overall slowdown in economic growth this year.\n\nIn an effort to support growth, the People's Bank of China has cut rates, including an unexpected cut on Monday of 10 basis points to some one-year interest rates for institutions, known as the medium-term lending facility. While the PBOC may hope the cut could ease some of homebuyers' burden and help developers get loans, the problem isn't just about funding, said Bruce Pang, chief economist and head of research for Greater China at JLL. He noted how developers have found it harder to obtain funding on their own, and have had to rely more on pre-sales to homebuyers. But people are increasingly cautious about buying new homes due to their expectations for future employment and returns on existing investment products, he added. Despite multiple reports of government plans to keep developers funded, the central government has yet to officially announce broader support for real estate. A readout of a high-level government meeting last month said local governments are responsible for delivering completed houses. Among three major sources of developer funding, advance payments and deposits have fallen the most this year, down by 34%, according to Wu's analysis. Credit as a source of funding dropped by 22%, while self-raised capital, including stocks and bonds, was down by 17%, the annualized data showed.\n\nInvestors turn away from China property\n\nInvestment funds have largely stayed away from Chinese property developers, reducing a potential source of funding. \"What has been worrying has been the lack of willingness and speed by top policymakers in resolving real estate developer's funding issues,\" Carol Lye, assistant portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, said in an emailed response to CNBC. Lye said the investment management firm's allocation to China real estate is low, and that Brandywine holds \"high quality real estate bonds that have been given preference in terms of government support.\" Some investors have even turned to companies in other parts of Asia. \"We've exited almost all of our holdings in China residential. It's more a wait-and-see game in terms of getting back exposure,\" said Xin Yan Low, Singapore-based portfolio manager for Asia property equities at Janus Henderson. She declined to share a timeframe of those sales. \"There are still many alternatives in the region, especially with reopening now, Singapore, Australia, basically back to full reopening, fundamentals are strong,\" she said.

The UK does lag behind many other western countries in the productivity league table. Across the G7 group of major industrial countries, the average worker produces 13% more an hour than the average British worker and the gap is getting bigger.\n\nOfficial data also appears to show a divide between London and the rest of the country, with workers in the capital apparently 80% more productive than the national average. Truss suggests this is a mindset issue.\n\nThe idea, though, that the UK\u2019s deep-rooted economic problems are caused by shirking or a lack of effort does not stand up to serious scrutiny. Britain has one of the most deregulated labour markets in the developed world and the average British worker puts in more hours a week than the European average.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is a country where management has the whip hand and, for the most part, workers are not protected by unions. To the extent Truss\u2019s analysis was ever true, it harks back to a labour market that has long since disappeared \u2013 now replaced by one in which an army of gig economy and self-employed workers toil away to make a living.\n\nThe real reason for Britain\u2019s poor productivity lies elsewhere. UK business investment as a share of national output, or gross domestic product, is the lowest in the G7. It is a similar story with research and development, to which the UK devotes 1.7% of GDP annually, compared with an average of 3.1% for members of the developed country club, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nBritain\u2019s economic model is based on an abundance of cheap labour and under-investment in up to date capital equipment and product innovation. Skills levels are higher in a country such as Germany because the Germans invest more in training.\n\nThe difference between Britain and better performing countries is not that they work harder than we do, but that they work smarter than we do. Foreign-owned companies in the UK tend to have higher productivity, so if \u201cmindset\u201d is the issue then it is the mindset of management that counts.\n\nNor is it really the case that productivity is higher in London because workers in the capital have a \u201ccan do\u201d spirit lacking elsewhere. As a paper from researchers at Sheffield Hallam University found, once adjusted for factors including the size of the working age population, the concentration of high productivity jobs in finance and the number of hours worked, the gap virtually disappears.\n\nTruss\u2019s team say the remarks made some years ago have been taken out of context but they seem pretty clear.

His song was called \u201cEDD,\u201d after California\u2019s Employment Development Department, which paid the benefits.\n\n\u201cI just seen 30 cards land in one day.

Andrew Kelly | Reuters\n\nIf inflation has been the biggest threat to U.S. economic growth, then July's data should provide signs that there's at least some relief in the pipeline. Prices were flat for the month as gauged by the items that the Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks for its consumer price index. That marked the first time the aggregate measure hadn't posted a month-over-month increase since May 2020, when the widely followed index showed a modest decline. Just a month ago, CPI posted its fastest 12-month gain since November 1982, following a trend that helped send economic growth into contraction for the first half of the year, stirring up talk of a recession. But with at least the short-term trend indicating the rate of price increases is abating, economic optimism is perking up.\n\nNo recession, for now\n\n\"The whole recession narrative really needs to be put on a shelf for now,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies. \"I think it's going to be shifting to a stronger-for-longer narrative, which is really supported by a reversal in inflation.\" Markowska, whose forecasts this year have been accurate, sees solid growth in the near term, including a 3% growth rate in the third quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow gauge, which tracks economic data in real time, pointed to a 2.5% growth rate in a Wednesday update, up 1.1 percentage points from its last one on Aug. 4. However, Markowska also expects pressures to intensify in 2023, with a recession likely in the back part of the year. Indeed, there was a little bit for both arguments in the CPI report. Most of the tempering in inflation came because of a fall in energy prices. Gasoline slid 7.7%, the biggest monthly decline since April 2020. Fuel oil tumbled 11% as energy-related commodity prices were off 7.6%.\n\nTransportation services cost increases also came off the boil, with airline fares tumbling 7.8% to reverse a trend that has seen tickets surge 27.7% over the past year. But there were few other signs of inflation declines in the report, with food costs particularly high. The food index, in fact, rose 1.1% on the month, and its 10.9% pace over the past 12 months is the highest since May 1979. That's causing worries at places such as City Harvest, which helps feed needy New Yorkers who have been hit especially hard by price surge that began last year. \"We're seeing many more children come into food pantries,\" said Jilly Stephens, the organization's CEO. \"Food insecurity had been intractable even before the pandemic hit. Now we're seeing even more people turn to food pantries because of the rising prices.\" Stephens said the number of children seeking food assistance about doubled a year after the Covid pandemic hit, and the organization is struggling to keep up. \"We're always optimistic, because we are supported by incredibly generous New Yorkers,\" she said.\n\nPeople keep spending", "summary": "A shopping cart is seen in a supermarket as inflation affected consumer prices in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., June 10, 2022.\nAndrew Kelly | ReutersIf inflation has been the biggest threat to U.S. economic growth, then July's data should provide signs that there's at least some relief in the pipeline.\nBut with at least the short-term trend indicating the rate of price increases is abating, economic optimism is perking up.\n\"I think it's going to be shifting to a stronger-for-longer narrative, which is really supported by a reversal in inflation.\"\nMarkowska, whose forecasts this year have been accurate, sees solid growth in the near term, including a 3% growth rate in the third quarter."},

Wheat, soybean, sugar, and corn futures have fallen from their March highs back to prices seen at the start of 2022. Olga Maltseva | Afp | Getty Images\n\nFood prices dropped significantly in July from the previous month, particularly the costs of wheat and vegetable oil, according to the latest figures from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. But the FAO said that while the drop in food prices \"from very high levels\" is \"welcome,\" there are doubts over whether the good news will last. \"Many uncertainties remain, including high fertilizer prices that can impact future production prospects and farmers' livelihoods, a bleak global economic outlook, and currency movements, all of which pose serious strains for global food security,\" FAO chief economist Maximo Torero said in a press release. The FAO food price index, which tracks the monthly change in the global prices of a basket of food commodities, fell 8.6% in July from the month before. In June, the index fell just 2.3% month on month. However, the index in July was still 13.1% higher than July 2021.\n\nPrices in the short term may fall further, if futures are anything to go by. Wheat, soybean, sugar, and corn futures have fallen from their March highs back to prices seen at the start of 2022. For example, the wheat contracts closed at $775.75 per bushel on Friday, down from a 12-year high of $1,294 in March, and around the $758 price set in January.\n\nWhy prices fell\n\nAnalysts cited a mix of both demand and supply reasons for the slide in food prices: Ukraine and Russia's closely watched agreement to resume exports of grain through the Black Sea after months of blockade; better-than-expected crop harvests; a global economic slowdown; and the strong U.S. dollar. Rob Vos, the director of markets, trade and institutions at the International Food Policy Research Institute, pointed to the news that the United States and Australia are set to deliver bumper wheat harvests this year, which will improve supply since shipment from Ukraine and Russia have been curtailed. The higher U.S. dollar also lowers the price of staples, since commodities are priced in U.S. dollars, Vos said. Traders tend to ask for lower nominal dollar prices of commodities when the greenback is expensive. The widely heralded U.N.-backed deal between Ukraine and Russia also helped to cool the market. Ukraine was the world's sixth-biggest wheat exporter in 2021, accounting for 10% of global wheat market share, according to the United Nations. The first shipment of Ukrainian grain \u2014 26,000 tons of maize \u2014 since the invasion left the country's southwestern port of Odesa last Monday.\n\nSkepticism over Ukraine-Russia deal\n\nGlobal skepticism over whether Russia will keep its end of the bargain hangs in the air. Russia fired a missile onto Odesa just hours after the U.N.-brokered deal in late-July. And freight and insurance companies may still think it's too risky to ship grain out of a war zone, Vos said, adding that food prices remain volatile and any new shock can cause more price surges. \"To make a difference it will not be enough to get a few shipments out, but at least 30 or 40 per month to get the existing grains stored in Ukraine out, as well as the produce of the upcoming harvest,\" said Vos. \"To help stabilize markets, the deal will need to hold in full also during the second half of the year since that is the period where Ukraine does most of its exports.\"\n\nEven with the existing agreement, arable Ukrainian land may continue to be destroyed \"for as long as the war continues,\" which will result in even less crop yield next year, Carlos Mera, the head of agri commodities market research at Rabobank, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Europe\" last week. \"Once this [grain] corridor is over, we might see even more price increases going forward,\" Mera said. Consumers could also see further price increases as there is normally a lag of three to nine months before a movement in commodity prices is reflected on supermarket shelves. Then there is the pressure of exporting enough grain as quickly as possible from a war zone. \"It's time that we're working again. I don't see us exporting two [to] five million tons per month out of these Black Sea ports,\" John Rich, the executive chairman of Ukrainian poultry giant Myronivsky Hliboproduct (MHP), told CNBC's \"Capital Connection\" on Monday. \"Hungry people, at the end of the day, get hungry very quickly after a week.\" In a note published earlier this month, credit rating agency Fitch Ratings' analysts wrote that a possible increase in fertilizer prices, which fell recently \u2014 but which are still double that of 2020 \u2014 could cause grain prices to jump again. Russia's restriction of gas supply has led European natural gas prices to spike. Natural gas is a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers. La Nina weather patterns could disrupt grain harvests later this year as well, they added.\n\nAnd the fall in food prices is not all good news. Part of the reason why staples have become cheaper is that traders and investors are pricing in recessionary fears, the analysts said. The global manufacturing purchasing managers' index has been in decline, while the U.S. Federal Reserve seems bent on raising interest rates to curb inflation even if it triggers a recession, the Fitch team wrote.\n\nFood staples", "summary": "But the FAO said that while the drop in food prices \"from very high levels\" is \"welcome,\" there are doubts over whether the good news will last.\nThe FAO food price index, which tracks the monthly change in the global prices of a basket of food commodities, fell 8.6% in July from the month before.\nIn June, the index fell just 2.3% month on month.\nUkraine was the world's sixth-biggest wheat exporter in 2021, accounting for 10% of global wheat market share, according to the United Nations.\nAnd the fall in food prices is not all good news."},

In the past 70 years, inflation has been as high as it is currently only three times: during the Korean war in the early 1950s, and after the two oil shocks of the mid- and late 1970s.\n\nNot for 40 years \u2013 since the period immediately before the Falklands war \u2013 has inflation climbed above 10%, but there has been upward pressure on the cost of living since the global economy started to emerge from the pandemic-enforced lockdowns during 2021.\n\nConsistently over the past year, the figure has come in higher than forecast, but it will not merely be the leap in the headline number for the consumer prices index (CPI) \u2013 up from 9.4% in June \u2013 that will be a cause for concern.\n\nFor a start, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said price increases were evident pretty much across the board. The ONS splits the CPI into 12 categories, and in nine of them inflation picked up last month. Food prices rose particularly strongly but there were also increases in clothing and footwear, restaurants and hotels, and recreation and culture.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there is clearly further bad news to come. The price of goods leaving factory gates \u2013 an indication of inflation in the pipeline \u2013 rose by more than 17% in the year to July, the highest rate in 45 years.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Oil prices are well below their peak and that is feeding in \u2013 albeit slowly \u2013 to the prices paid by motorists for petrol and diesel. The war in Ukraine has also prompted many countries to plant more crops to compensate for the lost supply, and while the ONS says the increased production has yet to be reflected in UK shop prices, it thinks it will have an effect over the coming months.\n\nEven so, the annual inflation rate has clearly not yet topped out, and if anything the Bank of England\u2019s forecast of a peak of 13.2% in October may prove optimistic.\n\nThreadneedle Street digs beneath the headline CPI figure to look at measures of core inflation. Here, too, there was bad news. Inflation excluding food, fuel, alcohol and tobacco, stood at 6.2% in July, up from 5.8% in June. The inflation rate for services, which provides a clue to price pressures generated domestically as opposed to global forces, was 5.7% in July, compared with 5.2% in June.\n\nThe strength of headline and underlying inflation makes it more likely that the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee will follow its 0.5 percentage-point increase in interest rates this month with a similar-sized move when it meets again in September.\n\nAt the same time, the risks of a hard landing for the economy have increased because the ever-widening gap between prices and wages is leading to a sharp fall in consumer spending power.\n\nThe ONS reported on Tuesday that regular real wages \u2013 excluding bonuses \u2013 were falling at a record rate of 3% \u2013 but that was based on a different measure of the cost of living to the one used by the government to assess whether its 2% inflation target is being hit.\n\nUsing the government\u2019s preferred measure, real earnings are falling by more than 5% \u2013 unprecedented in modern times.

The figure was last higher in February 1982.\n\nIt is only the fourth time in 70 years that inflation has breached the 10% threshold, the other periods being 1951-52, 1973-77 and 1979-82.\n\nThe reading exceeded the 9.8% forecast from City economists, as the cost of food and drink rose at the highest rates since 2008 amid a broad-based inflationary burst across the economy.\n\nThe biggest increases came for bread and cereals, dairy, meat and vegetables, with the rising cost of food leading to record increases for restaurant and hotel prices and pushing up the cost of takeaways. Price rises for other staple items such as pet food, toilet rolls, toothbrushes and deodorants also sent inflation soaring.\n\nPrices for package holidays and air fares rose sharply, driven by a summer rush reflected in packed airports across the country.\n\nThe latest figures will pile renewed pressure on the government and Conservative leadership candidates amid accusations the frontrunner, Liz Truss, and Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, are failing to grasp the scale of the cost of living emergency.\n\nRachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said soaring prices were leaving families worried about how to make ends meet in the run-up to a difficult winter. \u201cPeople are worried sick, and while the Tories are busy fighting and ignoring the scale of this crisis.

Here's a recap of Tuesday's key moments: We want growth without inflation WMT, HD earnings beats boost retailers Quick mentions: CTRA, DIS, WFC 1. We want growth without inflation Stocks were mixed Tuesday, with tech names keeping a lid on the Nasdaq as bond yields moved higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up for its fifth straight session. West Texas Intermediate crude, the American oil benchmark, fell 2.5%, which bodes well for inflation. Jim Cramer has repeatedly said that he believes oil's peak in June helped cool down inflation in July. While the market and economy have shown promising signs recently, Jim emphasized Tuesday: \"We want growth without inflation. We don't want oil to be too hot.\" 2. WMT, HD earnings beats boost retailers Home Depot (HD) and Walmart (WMT) reported earnings beats before the bell on Tuesday, pushing other retailers' stocks up, including Club holding Costco (COST). While we held positions in both Walmart and Costco earlier this year, we sold off the former after its warnings of excess inventory and the potential impact to its bottom line. Costco, on the other hand, has not faced the same kind of inventory issues. It's also successfully raised prices for some items and held prices steady for others, all while maintaining strong sales. This week is chock-full of other retailers reporting earnings. See a list here . We'll be watching each one as they reveal their financial results, and in turn, provide insights on consumers spending and inflation. 3. Quick mentions: CTRA, DIS, WFC We also have updates on some other Club names. Natural gas soared roughly 5% on Tuesday, spiking to its highest level since late July. This is good news for Club holding Coterra Energy (CTRA), which Jim calls \"the best natural gas company in the country.\" We have reviewed Dan Loeb's recommendations on Disney (DIS), and we believe there's nothing revelatory there. Cost cutting, for example, is something we're sure the company already has on its radar. As for Loeb's urging that Disney spin off ESPN, we believe that while that could be good for the company's bottom-line in the short-term, having a live sports component to its streaming is crucial, especially since it helps differentiate its product from other services like Netflix (NFLX). Banks have been performing well recently, and we believe that the best ones to own right now are Bank of America (BAC) and Club holding Wells Fargo (WFC) for their large deposit bases.

Olivier Douliery | AFP | Getty Images\n\nYou'd be hard-pressed now to find a recession in the rearview mirror. What's down the road, though, is another story. There is no historical precedent to indicate that an economy in recession can produce 528,000 jobs in a month, as the U.S. did during July. A 3.5% unemployment rate, tied for the lowest since 1969, is not consistent with contraction. But that doesn't mean there isn't a recession ahead, and, ironically enough, it is the labor market's phenomenal resiliency that could pose the broader economy's biggest long-run danger. The Federal Reserve is trying to ease pressures on a historically tight jobs situation and its rapid wage gains in an effort to control inflation running at its highest level in more than 40 years.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is this gives the Fed additional room to continue to tighten, even if it raises the probability of pushing the economy into recession,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \"It's not going to be an easy task to continue to tighten without negative repercussions for the consumer and the economy.\" Indeed, following the robust job numbers, which included a 5.2% 12-month gain for average hourly earnings, traders accelerated their bets on a more aggressive Fed. As of Friday afternoon, markets were assigning about a 69% chance of the central bank enacting its third straight 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike when it meets again in September, according to CME Group data. So while President Joe Biden celebrated the big jobs number on Friday, a much more unpleasant data point could be on the way next week. The consumer price index, the most widely followed inflation measure, comes out Wednesday, and it's expected to show continued upward pressure even with a sharp drop in gasoline prices in July. That will complicate the central bank's balancing act of using rate increases to temper inflation without tipping the economy into recession. As Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at asset management giant BlackRock, said, the challenge is \"how to execute a 'soft landing' when the economy is coming in hot, and is landing on a runway it has never used before.\" \"Today's print, coming in much stronger than anticipated, complicates the job of a Federal Reserve that seeks to engineer a more temperate employment environment, in keeping with its attempts to moderate current levels of inflation,\" Rieder said in a client note. \"The question though now is how much longer (and higher) will rates have to go before inflation can be brought under control?\"\n\nMore recession signs", "summary": "Olivier Douliery | AFP | Getty ImagesYou'd be hard-pressed now to find a recession in the rearview mirror.\nThere is no historical precedent to indicate that an economy in recession can produce 528,000 jobs in a month, as the U.S. did during July.\nBut that doesn't mean there isn't a recession ahead, and, ironically enough, it is the labor market's phenomenal resiliency that could pose the broader economy's biggest long-run danger.\n\"It's not going to be an easy task to continue to tighten without negative repercussions for the consumer and the economy.\"\nThat will complicate the central bank's balancing act of using rate increases to temper inflation without tipping the economy into recession."},

Card 1 of 5 Inflation F.A.Q. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. Inflation F.A.Q. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Inflation F.A.Q. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. Inflation F.A.Q. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Inflation F.A.Q. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks.

Looney appeared unaware that he, like everybody else in the UK, would get the discount automatically from October. It was only later that BP offered the PR-friendly answer that its \u00a34.4m-a-year boss would make a donation to charity.\n\nLooney\u2019s bafflement was understandable. High earners like him (and, indeed, high earners collecting considerably less) obviously don\u2019t need assistance from the state in paying their energy bills this winter. There was no sound economic reason for Sunak to add a universally applied \u00a3400 element to a package that was otherwise rightly concentrated on vulnerable households, meaning those most affected by higher bills.\n\nThat point, bizarrely, seems to have been lost on Sir Keir Starmer. The Labour leader has opted to back the most untargeted form of support this winter \u2013 a plan to freeze the price of energy for all consumers, rich and poor alike, at its current level for six months.\n\nThe idea is popular, we\u2019re told, because three out of four Tory voters support it. In that sense, it may represent smart politics; the next prime minister will be under pressure to adopt chunks of the proposal, including the increase in the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers. But the economics of freezing energy prices for all households, as opposed to only those least able to afford higher prices, makes little sense.\n\nStarmer\u2019s scheme has the virtue of simplicity, it could be argued \u2013 and, yes, the plan is costed if one accepts the \u00a37bn fiddle with the effect of temporarily reduced inflation-related payments on government debt. But a programme that costs \u00a330bn for six months becomes vastly expensive if it has to be repeated for as long as wholesale prices remain high \u2013 a timeframe that is currently unknowable. If the Looney household and others didn\u2019t need Sunak\u2019s \u00a3400 discount, they definitely don\u2019t require the average \u00a31,000 saving that Labour\u2019s proposal would deliver.\n\nMore to the point, artificially holding down prices for everybody undermines the incentive on wealthier households to reduce their energy consumption, an imperative that ought to be front and centre of any national plan to get through the emergency. Starmer is also talking the language of more insulation in homes, but artificially underpricing a scarce resource does nothing to encourage consumers to turn down their boiler settings in the short term, use their spin dryers less, and so on. \u201cSuppressing the price signal is only going to increase the likelihood that we run out of energy this winter,\u201d says one independent energy analyst, Peter Atherton. Exactly right.\n\nOne can argue all day about how to define a high-earning household that doesn\u2019t need support from the public purse, but a means-tested approach of some form still seems the best way to proceed. It would be fairer, more financially sustainable in the long term and more likely to change behaviour. Labour\u2019s plan has got off on the wrong foot; support should be targeted.\n\nHeathrow seems to have redefined success\n\nThe way the Heathrow chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, tells it, imposing a cap on the number of flights at the airport has been a complete triumph. Limiting the number of departing passengers to 100,000 a day since July has delivered fewer last-minute flight cancellations, better take-off punctuality and shorter waits for bags, the airport was boasting only last week.\n\nSo, having bought time to regroup and focus, is Heathrow now in a position to resume a normal schedule in time for the next surge in demand that will arrive with the October half-term holiday? Actually, no. The airport is extending the cap until 29 October for the same reason: that it needs to support \u201cmore reliable and resilient passenger journeys\u201d.\n\nAn extension is probably sensible if Heathrow \u2013 or the ground-handling firms it usually blames during episodes of chaos \u2013 still haven\u2019t got the necessary resources in place. But let\u2019s not miss the wider picture. Being bounced into capping the number of passengers was a spectacular failure of management that flowed from the under-estimation of the speed of the recovery in demand. Taking even longer to fix the problem is not a success.", "summary": "High earners like him (and, indeed, high earners collecting considerably less) obviously don\u2019t need assistance from the state in paying their energy bills this winter.\nThe idea is popular, we\u2019re told, because three out of four Tory voters support it.\nBut the economics of freezing energy prices for all households, as opposed to only those least able to afford higher prices, makes little sense.\n\u201cSuppressing the price signal is only going to increase the likelihood that we run out of energy this winter,\u201d says one independent energy analyst, Peter Atherton.\nOne can argue all day about how to define a high-earning household that doesn\u2019t need support from the public purse, but a means-tested approach of some form still seems the best way to proceed."},

Here\u2019s why UK beer costs are far outpacing inflation", "author": ["Elliot Smith"], "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/05/why-the-price-of-a-pint-of-beer-in-the-uk-is-going-through-the-roof.html", "content": "LONDON \u2014 The average cost of a pint of beer in the U.K. has soared by 70% since 2008 \u2014 well ahead of inflation \u2014 and some Londoners are parting with as much as \u00a38 ($9.70) for 568ml of the amber nectar. According to figures from consultancy firm CGA, the average cost of a pint has risen from \u00a32.30 in 2008 to \u00a33.95 in 2022, though prices vary drastically across locations. Average prices rose by 15 pence between 2021 and 2022, up almost 4%, one of the largest year-on-year increases since 2008. The average price of a pint at one unnamed pub in London hit an eye-watering \u00a38.06 this year, the highest CGA has ever recorded, while the lowest nationally was a \u00a31.79 average at a pub in Lancashire, in the northwest of England. U.K. inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.4% in June and is expected to rise beyond 13% in October, compounding the country's historic cost-of-living crisis and prompting the Bank of England to implement its largest interest rate hike since 1995 on Thursday. Many pubs and hospitality venues are concerned that consumers will increasingly stay at home. Paul Bolton, client director for GB drinks at CGA, told CNBC that a combination of supply chain issues, staffing shortages, soaring energy costs, lingering pandemic-era debts and generally high inflation are increasing suppliers' cost pressures, which then have to be passed onto the consumer. Raw materials and energy Francois Sonneville, senior beverage analyst at Rabobank, told CNBC that prices are increasing throughout the value chain, starting with barley. \"The barley price has gone up, and has doubled since 2021. There's two reasons for that: one is that the harvest in North America was really poor, driven by a poor climate, so there was not much inventory to start with \u2013 and then, of course, we had the Black Sea region conflict,\" he told CNBC's Arabile Gumede.\n\nA pint of Adnams Ghost Ship Citrus pale Ale. The Suffolk-based brewer says a combination of soaring energy, labor and raw material costs is squeezing businesses and driving up the price of a pint. Geography Photos/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nHistorically, when grain prices increased, farmers would compensate by planting more the following year, but broader agricultural inflation is also putting a squeeze on farms, outpacing even the 40-year high of 9.4% headline inflation in the U.K. \"Where our normal inflation is running at 8, 9%, (agricultural) inflation for our businesses is running somewhere over 22, 23%,\" explained Richard Hirst, owner of Hirst Farms in Suffolk. \"That's a function of obviously oil prices, fuel \u2013 our tractor diesel has gone up more than three times in price, which is a lot more, relatively, than road fuel has gone up.\" Hirst said the farm is also facing substantial labor cost increases, with shortages affecting the farming industry nationwide, along with fertilizer costs. \"Fertilizer costs will have tripled for next year \u2013 we're buying fertilizer now three times what it was last year. Our chemical inputs are going up and just the cost of running machinery, whether it's spare parts or actually just the cost of buying machinery itself. All that has gone up an awful lot more than the 9 or 10% of normal inflation.\"\n\nHowever, barley is not the main cost incurred during the brewing process \u2013 in fact, it only contributes around 5% of the price of beer at the tap. The biggest costs, analysts and business leaders told CNBC, come from labor, packaging and energy. \"I think that if you look at the brewing process itself, it uses a lot of energy \u2013 and the energy price has gone up, as we all know, when we stop at the pump \u2013 but the most important one is probably packaging,\" Sonneville said. \"Packaging makes up about 25 to 30% of the cost price of beer, and glass packaging, glass bottles, use about 25% of their cost in energy, so with gas prices going 10 times higher now than they were two years ago, that has a massive impact on the cost of a brewer.\" Labor of love His comments were echoed by Andy Wood, CEO of Suffolk-based brewery and hospitality business Adnams, who told CNBC that the energy price increases the company is seeing are \"absolutely eye-watering.\" \"Brewing beer or distilling spirits involves a lot of boiling water, so that involves lots of energy to get to that state, although we've put quite a number of innovations in over the years to limit the impact of that,\" he explained. Wood said in the aftermath of Brexit and the pandemic, a tightening of the U.K. labor market is also exerting upward wage pressure, which will likely be exacerbated by the country's escalating cost-of-living crisis. \"The biggest cost that we have is our payroll because the hospitality part of that business is a people-driven business,\" he added. What's more, the geopolitical headwinds facing businesses throughout the supply chain are unlikely to abate any time soon.\n\n\"So we've got Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we've got the energy crisis that that's brought on, we've got the food supply crisis, grain, cooking oils, these types of things, and then \u2026 we hear in the media that China may be looking longingly at Taiwan, so I think the geopolitical situation is getting no easier, so I think these things are here to stay,\" he said. The question for businesses, according to both Wood and Sonneville, is how many of these costs they can absorb, how much should be passed onto consumers, and in the midst of a cost of living crisis, how to sustain margins without forcing the consumer to stay at home and jeopardizing volumes. Brewers tend to have long-term contracts and hedges in place to ensure contingency plans for future price rises, meaning not all of their costs are fully reflected at present, and therefore not immediately passed onto consumers. \"I think if you look at the price of beer that you and I pay, there is a risk that that will go higher, because there is a lagging effect of costs at the brewery because of those long-term contracts,\" Sonneville said on Monday. \"The hope that I think is there at brewers is that prices will come down. We have not seen that in gas \u2014 we've seen more sanctions there and gas prices have actually risen in the last three days \u2014 but we have seen that grain prices have come off a little bit, and the hope is that that will continue.\" Shifting trends Wood noted that consumer sentiment and behavior had already begun to shift in the face of higher prices at the bar. \"We're certainly seeing people come out earlier in the evening, having their drinks, having their dinner, and then they're going back home,\" he said. \"We're seeing people perhaps having two courses rather than three courses, and perhaps having a glass of wine rather than a bottle of wine, so we are seeing some changes in consumer behavior, there is no doubt about that.\" This was reflected in CGA's latest consumer analysis, which found that premium products and venues offering particularly unique experiences were increasing their share of the on-trade.", "summary": "Average prices rose by 15 pence between 2021 and 2022, up almost 4%, one of the largest year-on-year increases since 2008.\nThe Suffolk-based brewer says a combination of soaring energy, labor and raw material costs is squeezing businesses and driving up the price of a pint.\nHirst said the farm is also facing substantial labor cost increases, with shortages affecting the farming industry nationwide, along with fertilizer costs.\n\"Fertilizer costs will have tripled for next year \u2013 we're buying fertilizer now three times what it was last year.\nLabor of love His comments were echoed by Andy Wood, CEO of Suffolk-based brewery and hospitality business Adnams, who told CNBC that the energy price increases the company is seeing are \"absolutely eye-watering.\""},

Brent crude oil futures prices reached the joint-lowest level since February, while West Texas Intermediate set a new low. Falling energy prices would be a blessing to economies around the world in the short term as they struggle with the political and financial implications of inflation, but $90 for a barrel of oil is still pretty high in historical terms. It is likely to be the poorest households who bear the most pain when bills rise in the winter. In the UK the energy price cap is expected to rise above \u00a34,200 for an average annual bill in January. New analysis by the Resolution Foundation suggests that the poorest fifth of households will have to cut their discretionary spending by more than a fifth to make up for the energy price increase. Even the richest households will have to tighten their belts. Poorer UK households will have to reduce their spending by more than a fifth to pay for energy bills.

Little wonder that economists are bracing for recession in the UK and elsewhere \u2013 and little wonder that it is likely to be the key political issue for the contenders to be UK prime minister. The Resolution Foundation\u2019s Mike Brewer, Karl Handscomb, and Jonathan Marshall wrote: This winter, low-income households will have to reduce their spending by three times as much as high-income households in order to afford their energy bills \u2013 a situation that is particularly concerning now that we know energy bills in January-March 2023 are set to be an annualised \u00a34,266, rather than the \u00a32,800 expected earlier this year.

It appears traders across the Atlantic also have their eye on a possible Chinese slowdown. Here are the opening snaps, via Reuters: S&P 500 DOWN 22.85 POINTS, OR 0.53%, AT 4,257.30 AFTER MARKET OPEN\n\nNASDAQ DOWN 50.98 POINTS, OR 0.39%, AT 12,996.20 AFTER MARKET OPEN\n\nDOW JONES DOWN 171.96 POINTS, OR 0.51%, AT 33,589.09 AFTER MARKET OPEN\n\n\n\n4d ago 14.25 Oil prices fall to lowest level since before Russia invaded Ukraine The latest dip has pushed Brent crude oil, the North Sea benchmark, to a low of $92.78: that is the joint lowest level since before Vladimir Putin ordered the start of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Monday\u2019s steep oil price decline exactly matched the previous post-invasion low, which was reached on 5 August. Brent prices peaked on 7 March at $139.13 when concerns over supplies from Russia reached their height.

Photograph: Refinitiv It is a similar story for West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, which hit a low of $86.82, the lowest since 3 February.\n\n\n\n4d ago 13.37 Oil prices down by $5 after weak Chinese data sparks concerns Chinese industrial production was lower than expected by economists in July. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images The latest check-in on oil prices: prices have dropped by as much as $5. That\u2019s a pretty chunky move for a single day (although things can be magnified in mid-August when a lot of traders are lying on beaches, meaning fewer sellers can have an outsized impact). The new low for the day for Brent crude futures prices is $93.03. That is really not far off the nearly six-month low ($92.78) set just before Russia invaded Ukraine. It is 5.1% down, or $5, for the day. A persistent drop in energy prices would be welcome news for households around the world, who are struggling with inflation. However, it remains to be seen whether a durable decline will be delivered. And it should also be noted that the reason for the decline is not exactly a short-term positive: traders are looking at the global economy and thinking about recessions in several of the biggest economies. That was sparked by weak Chinese data earlier this morning: Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, explains: It is becoming quite clear that weakness in Chinese oil demand is one of the main reasons for the steady decline in oil prices since early June. Chinese crude oil imports were below 9m barrels per day in both June and July and oil demand is no higher today than it was in October 2019. There is little hope that China will change its Covid-19 stance anytime soon and there is a high risk that Chinese demand weakness persists amid continued rolling lock-downs from month to month. A normalisation of Chinese oil demand at some point in time will be extremely bullish for oil prices, but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to happen anytime soon.\n\n\n\n4d ago 12.00 Nationwide to pay \u00a31,200 to lower-paid staff as cost of living bonus Nationwide will pay more than 11,000 a bonus to cover increased living costs. Photograph: Maureen McLean/REX/Shutterstock Nationwide Building Society will pay more than 11,000 of its staff \u00a31,200 to help them cope with Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis. The offer will be made to staff making less than \u00a335,000, or about 61% of Nationwide\u2019s workforce of 18,000 people, said Nationwide, a mutual owned by its customers. The building society has already raised pay by 4% earlier this year, but with inflation expected to reach 13% by the Bank of England that would result in a steep real-terms pay cut. A bonus would address some of this pay rise, but with the advantage for the business of not locking in a higher wage bill. The company\u2019s press release makes it very clear the bonus is a \u201cone off\u201d. HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest and the UK arm of Santander have all announced similar bonuses. Debbie Crosbie, Nationwide\u2019s chief executive, said: The months ahead will be worrying for many people and we\u2019re always considering new ways to help our members. But rising prices affect our colleagues too and that\u2019s why we\u2019re providing this additional support.\n\n\n\n4d ago 11.33 Every time you look at oil prices this morning it seems like they have lost more ground. The new low for Brent crude today is $93.54, down $4.60 today or 4.7%. The post-invasion low is $92.78. That\u2019s still 70 cents away, but after today\u2019s drop that suddenly doesn\u2019t look implausible.\n\n\n\n4d ago 11.15 Today\u2019s commodity price sell-off is giving a good case study of the importance of mining and oil companies to the FTSE 100. London\u2019s benchmark index is the only one of Europe\u2019s main markets to have dipped into the red this morning. Europe may have its fair share of old economy stalwarts (compared to the US\u2019s tech-heavy stock benchmarks), but the FTSE 100 is uniquely exposed to commodities among its peers (and that\u2019s even after a giant steel company, Evraz, was suspended because it was owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, who is under UK sanctions). The FTSE 100 was the only major European index in the red on Monday morning. Photograph: Refinitiv\n\n\n\n4d ago 10.52 Oil isn\u2019t the only commodity under pressure. The benchmark LME nickel contract dropped more than 3% this morning, silver is down 2.3%, platinum has fallen 2.6%. That commodity sell-off has dragged back the FTSE 100. It is just about in the red, with miners Antofagasta, Anglo American and Rio Tinto plus supermajor oil companies Shell and BP among the 10 biggest fallers. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at trading platform OANDA, said: The figures from China really are a concern and the authorities have a big job on their hands arresting flagging domestic demand. That doesn\u2019t bode well for oil demand especially when the country remains so committed to zero-Covid. And with cases continuing to rise, the downward pressure on oil prices could intensify. Throw in a deal between the US and Iran and we may be able to wave goodbye to triple-digit oil prices for a while. Of course, it doesn\u2019t matter how close the two are, a deal can never be assumed to be done until it\u2019s signed. If it does get over the line, we could see oil slip below $90 and perhaps even stay there.\n\n\n\n4d ago 10.35 And just like that Brent crude oil prices have dropped by more than a dollar: as I write it\u2019s at $94.67. That\u2019s a $3.40 drop for today, or 3.6%. Oil prices dropped steeply on Monday morning. Photograph: Refinitiv The most obvious cause appears to be jitters caused by China\u2019s weak economic data. A major slowdown would likely drag back demand for oil.\n\n\n\n4d ago 10.22 And here is a reminder of what an energy crisis can do: Kosovo is starting intermittent power cuts because it is too expensive to import energy. \u201cConsumers will have six hours on and two hours off,\u201d a spokesman for Kosovo\u2019s energy distribution company, KEDS, told Reuters. Kosovo relies almost exclusively on coal (which is also very polluting) but consumption of up to 800 megawatts (MW) is far outstripping supply of 500MW. Reuters reports: In a statement on Sunday, KEDS said that it and the country\u2019s transmission system operator, KOSTT, could not afford to import electricity and must rely on domestic production. About 90% of the country\u2019s electricity production is from coal, and the power utility KEK has said it had shut down almost half of its generators for regular maintenance to prepare them for winter.\n\n\n\n4d ago 10.09 Oil prices have dipped further: the price of a barrel of Brent crude for October delivery is now at $96.07 \u2013 $2 down for the day. Prices are near their lowest level since markets reacted to Russia ratcheting up tension with Ukraine ahead of its invasion. The lowest point this month on 5 August was below $93, a level not seen since 21 February, three days before Vladimir Putin ordered the start of the invasion. Oil prices fell near on Monday following surprise weakness in Chinese economic data, remaining near the lowest levels since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Photograph: Refinitiv The price of West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, has also fallen further: futures prices are down 2.3%, or $2.11, to just under $90 per barrel.\n\n\n\n4d ago 09.36 The then UK chancellor Rishi Sunak (now in the race to be prime minister against Liz Truss) told MPs in February that the government\u2019s aim was to make up for half the cost of energy price increases to households. In May, the government updated the support to be worth \u00a324bn. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) lays out the \u201cfive main strands\u201d: \u00a3400 to all households labelled as an \u201cenergy discount\u201d that will be subtracted from energy bills.\n\n\u00a3150 for all households in council tax bands A-D (around 80% of households).\n\n\u00a3650 for any family on means-tested benefits.\n\n\u00a3300 for pensioners on means-tested benefits.\n\n\u00a3150 for those on a disability benefit. That meant that the government was covering about three-quarters of the \u00a333bn increase in energy bills that was expected then, in May. The problem is that costs have continued to surge since then, to the point that bills are expected to more than double from already elevated levels come the winter. The consultancy Cornwall Insights forecasts that bills could rise to \u00a34,266 in January and \u00a34,426 in April before easing somewhat \u2013 but will remain elevated until we see a proper decline in wholesale prices. Given the cap is currently \u00a31,971, it is easy to see how the price of keeping support at the same level starts to stack up.\n\nUpdated at 09.42 BST\n\n4d ago 08.48 Another \u00a312bn needed to keep UK energy bills support at same level, says IFS Mark Sweney The government needs to spend another \u00a312bn to maintain the scale of support pledged to help families cope with the cost of living crisis as the energy prices continue to soar, according to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). The economics thinktank said that the additional funding will be needed to achieve the \u00a324bn package of aid announced in May, largely because the forecast increase in energy prices over the next year has jumped from 95% to 141%. This means that working age benefit claimants are now on course to see their real income fall by \u00a3620 over the year. The IFS says that the government would need to double the current \u00a3650 grant to those on benefits to protect them, as well as help low income pensioners and families in work, at a cost of \u00a35.5bn. Similarly, the cost of maintaining the \u00a3150 council tax rebate and \u00a3400 energy discount will now cost the government another \u00a37bn if it wants to continue to cover around half the increase in costs a typical family will be hit by over the year. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said: As prices of essentials including food, heating and fuel continues to rise, families on low-incomes are facing more uncertainty and pressures. The government is still playing catch up as inflation and the cost of energy continue to spiral upwards. Just achieving what they wanted to achieve back in May will cost an additional \u00a312bn, and a package on that scale will still leave many households much worse off.\n\n\n\n4d ago 08.25 The FTSE 100 has gained 0.3% in the first minutes of trading in this mid-August week, hitting its highest point since early June. The top gainer is RS Group, formerly known as Electrocomponents, amid speculation that it could be in line for a takeover bid. Pharma group AstraZeneca has gained 2.5% after it said that its breast cancer drug Enhertu had shown positive trial results. Elsewhere in Europe stocks are looking positive.

Scott Mlyn | CNBC\n\nIt wasn't long ago that Amazon, Shopify and Peloton doubled their workforces to manage through the pandemic surge, while Morgan Stanley staffed up to handle a record level of IPOs, and mortgage lenders added headcount as rock-bottom rates led to a refinancing boom. On the flipside, Delta Air Lines, Hilton Worldwide and legions of restaurants slashed headcount because of lockdowns that rolled through much of the country and other parts of the world. Now, they're scrambling to reverse course. Companies that hired like crazy in 2020 and 2021 to meet customer demand are being forced to make sweeping cuts or impose hiring freezes with a possible recession on the horizon. In a matter of months, CEOs have gone from hypergrowth mode to concerns over \"macroeconomic uncertainty,\" a phrase investors have heard many times on second-quarter earnings calls. Stock trading app Robinhood and crypto exchange Coinbase both recently slashed more than 1,000 jobs after their splashy market debuts in 2021. Meanwhile, airlines, hotels and eateries face the opposite problem as their businesses continue to pick up following the era of Covid-induced shutdowns. After instituting mass layoffs early in the pandemic, they can't hire quickly enough to satisfy demand and are dealing with a labor market radically different from the one they experienced over two years ago, before the cutbacks. \"The pandemic created very unique, once-in-a-lifetime conditions in many different industries that caused a dramatic reallocation of capital,\" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at job recruiting site ZipRecruiter. \"Many of those conditions no longer apply so you're seeing a reallocation of capital back to more normal patterns.\"\n\nFor employers, those patterns are particularly challenging to navigate, because inflation levels have jumped to a 40-year high, and the Fed has lifted its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point on consecutive occasions for the first time since the early 1990s. The central bank's efforts to tamp down inflation have raised concerns that the U.S. economy is headed for recession. Gross domestic product has fallen for two straight quarters, hitting a widely accepted rule of thumb for recession, though the National Bureau of Economic Research hasn't yet made that declaration. The downward trend was bound to happen eventually, and market experts lamented the frothiness in stock prices and absurdity of valuations as late as the fourth quarter of last year, when the major indexes hit record highs led by the riskiest assets. That was never more evident than in November, when electric vehicle maker Rivian went public on almost no revenue and quickly reached a market cap of over $150 billion. Bitcoin hit a record the same day, touching close to $69,000. Since then, bitcoin is off by two-thirds, and Rivian has lost about 80% of its value. In July, the car company started layoffs of about 6% of its workforce. Rivian's headcount almost quintupled to around 14,000 between late 2020 and mid-2022.\n\nTech layoffs and an air of caution\n\nJob cuts and hiring slowdowns were big talking points on tech earnings calls last week. Amazon reduced its headcount by 99,000 people to 1.52 million employees at the end of the second quarter after almost doubling in size during the pandemic, when it needed to beef up its warehouse capabilities. Shopify, whose cloud technology helps retailers build and manage online stores, cut about 1,000 workers, or around 10% of its global workforce. The company doubled its headcount over a two-year period starting at the beginning of 2020, as the business boomed from the number or stores and restaurants that had to suddenly go digital. Shopify CEO Tobias Lutke said in a memo to employees that the company had wagered that the pandemic surge would cause the transition from physical retail to ecommerce to \"permanently leap ahead by 5 or even 10 years.\" \"It's now clear that bet didn't pay off,\" Lutke wrote, adding that the picture was starting to look more like it did before Covid. \"Ultimately, placing this bet was my call to make and I got this wrong. Now, we have to adjust.\" After Facebook parent Meta missed on its results and forecast a second straight quarter of declining revenue, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will be reducing job growth over the next year. Headcount expanded by about 60% during the pandemic. \"This is a period that demands more intensity and I expect us to get more done with fewer resources,\" Zuckerberg said. Google parent Alphabet, which grew its workforce by over 30% during the two Covid years, recently told employees that they needed to focus and improve productivity. The company asked for suggestions on how to be more efficient at work.\n\n\"It's clear we are facing a challenging macro environment with more uncertainty ahead,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said in a meeting with employees. \"We should think about how we can minimize distractions and really raise the bar on both product excellence and productivity.\" Few U.S. companies have been hit as hard as Peloton, whose fitness equipment and on-demand classes became an instant gym replacement during lockdowns and which has since suffered from massive oversupply issues and out-of-control costs. After doubling headcount in the 12 months ended June 30, 2021, the company in February announced plans to cut 20% of corporate positions as it named a new CEO.\n\nBanks and Wall Street bracing for a 'hurricane'\n\nSome of the Peloton products that were flying off the shelves in the pandemic were being offered as perks for overworked junior bankers, who were sorely needed to help manage a boom in IPOs, mergers and stock issuance. Activity picked up with such ferocity that junior bankers were complaining about 100-hour workweeks, and banks started scouting for talent in unusual places like consulting and accounting firms. That helps explain why the six biggest U.S. banks added a combined 59,757 employees from the start of 2020 through the middle of 2022, the equivalent of the industry picking up the full population of a Morgan Stanley or a Goldman Sachs in a little over two years. It wasn't just investment banking. The government unleashed trillions of dollars in stimulus payments and small business loans designed to keep the economy moving amid the widespread shutdowns. A feared wave of loan defaults never arrived, and banks instead took in an unprecedented flood of deposits. Their Main Street lending operations had better repayment rates than before the pandemic. Among top banks, Morgan Stanley saw the biggest jump in headcount, with its employee levels expanding 29% to 78,386 from early 2020 to the middle of this year. The growth was fueled in part by CEO James Gorman\u2019s acquisitions of money management firms E-Trade and Eaton Vance. At rival investment bank Goldman Sachs, staffing levels jumped 22% to 47,000 in the same time frame, as CEO David Solomon broke into consumer finance and bolstered wealth management operations, including through the acquisition of fintech lender GreenSky. Citigroup saw a 15% boost in headcount during the pandemic, while JPMorgan Chase added 8.5% to its workforce, becoming the industry's largest employer. But the good times on Wall Street didn\u2019t last. The stock market had its worst first half in 50 years, and IPOs dried up. Investment banking revenue at the major players declined sharply in the second quarter. Goldman Sachs responded by slowing hiring and is considering a return to year-end job reductions, according to a person with knowledge of the bank\u2019s plans. Employees typically make up the single biggest line item when it comes to expenses in banking, so when markets crater, layoffs are usually on the horizon. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in June that an economic \"hurricane\" was on its way, and said the bank was bracing itself for volatile markets.\n\nJamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., during a Bloomberg Television interview in London, U.K., on Wednesday, May 4, 2022. Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nZipRecruiter's Pollak said one area in finance where there will likely be a hemorrhaging of workers is in mortgage lending. She said 60% more people went into real estate in 2020 and 2021 because of record low mortgage rates and rising home prices. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo have reportedly trimmed hundreds of mortgage staffers as volumes collapsed. \"Nobody is refinancing anymore, and sales are slowing,\" Pollak said. \"You're going to have to see employment levels and hiring slow down. That growth was all about that moment.\" The intersection of Silicon Valley and Wall Street is a particularly gloomy place at the moment as rising rates and crumbling stock multiples converge. Crypto trading platform Coinbase in June announced plans to lay off 18% of its workforce in preparation for a \"crypto winter\" and even rescinded job offers to people it had hired. Headcount tripled in 2021 to 3,730 employees. Stock trading app Robinhood said Tuesday it's cutting about 23% of its workforce, a little over three months after eliminating 9% of its full-time staff, which had ballooned from 2,100 to 3,800 in the last nine months of 2021. \"We are at the tail end of that pandemic-era distortion,\" said Aaron Terrazas, chief economist at job search and review site Glassdoor. \"Obviously, it's not going away, but it is changing to a more normalized period, and companies are adapting to this new reality.\"\n\nRetail is whipsawing back and forth\n\nNurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThey hardly could have predicted how quickly the dynamic would shift, as rapid and soaring inflation forced Americans to tighten their belts. Retailers have already started to warn of waning demand, leaving them with bloated inventories. Gap said higher promotions will hurt gross margins in its fiscal second quarter. Kohl's cut its guidance for the second quarter, citing softened consumer spending. Walmart last week slashed its profit forecast and said surging prices for food and gas are squeezing consumers. That pain is filtering into the ad market. Online bulletin board Pinterest on Monday cited \"lower than expected demand from U.S. big box retailers and mid-market advertisers\" as one reason why it missed Wall Street estimates for second-quarter earnings and revenue. Retail giants have so far avoided big layoff announcements, but smaller players are in cut mode. Stitch Fix, 7-Eleven and Game Stop have said they'll be eliminating jobs, and outdoor grill maker Weber warned it's considering layoffs as sales slow.\n\nThe travel industry can't hire fast enough\n\nWith all of the downsizing taking place across wide swaths of the U.S. economy, the applicant pool should be wide open for airlines, restaurants and hospitality companies, which are trying to repopulate their ranks after undergoing mass layoffs when Covid hit. It's not so easy. Even though Amazon has reduced headcount of late, it's still got far more people working in its warehouses than it did two years ago. Last year the company lifted average starting pay to $18 an hour, a level that's difficult to meet for much of the services industry. Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta said on the quarterly earnings call in May that he wasn't satisfied with customer service and that the company needs more workers. At the end of last year, even as travel was rebounding sharply, headcount at Hilton's managed, owned and leased properties as well as corporate locations was down by over 30,000 from two years earlier. It's easy to see why customer service is a challenge. According to a report last week from McKinsey on summer 2022 travel trends, revenue per available room in the U.S. \"is outstripping not just 2020 and 2021 levels, but increasingly 2019 levels too.\"\n\nDelta Airlines passenger jets are pictured outside the newly completed 1.3 million-square foot $4 billion Delta Airlines Terminal C at LaGuardia Airport in New York, June 1, 2022.

Each said Tuesday that the inflation fight is far from over and more monetary policy tightening will be needed.\n\nBoth Bullard and Mester are voting members this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. The group last week approved a second consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase to the Fed's benchmark borrowing rate.\n\nIf Bullard has his way, the rate will continue rising to a range of 3.75%-4% by the end of the year. After starting 2022 near zero, the rate has now come up to a range of 2.25%-2.5%.\n\nConsumer price inflation is running at a 12-month rate of 9.1%, its highest since November 1981. Even throwing out the highs and lows of inflation, as the Dallas Fed does with its \"trimmed mean\" estimate, inflation is running at 4.3%.\n\n\"We're going to have to see convincing evidence across the board, headline and other measures of core inflation, all coming down convincingly before we'll be able to feel like we're doing our job,\" Bullard said.\n\nThe rate hikes come at a time of slowing growth in the U.S., which has seen consecutive quarters of negative GDP readings, a common definition of recession. However, Bullard said he doesn't think the economy is really in recession.\n\n\"We're not in a recession right now. We do have these two quarters of negative GDP growth. To some extent, a recession is in the eyes of the beholder,\" he said. \"With all the job growth in the first half of the year, it's hard to say there's a recession. With a flat unemployment rate at 3.6%, it's hard to say there's a recession.\"\n\nThe second half of the year should see reasonably strong growth, though job gains probably will slow to their longer-run trend, he added. July's nonfarm payroll growth is expected to be 258,000, according to Dow Jones estimates.\n\nEven with the slowing trend, markets are pricing in another half percentage point rate hike from the Fed in September, though the chances of a third consecutive 0.75 percentage point move are rising. The market then expects future increases in November and December, taking the benchmark fed funds rate to a range of 3.25%-3.5% by the end of the year, below Bullard's target.\n\n\"We're going to follow the data very carefully, and I think we'll get it right,\" Bullard said.", "summary": "The group last week approved a second consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase to the Fed's benchmark borrowing rate.\nIf Bullard has his way, the rate will continue rising to a range of 3.75%-4% by the end of the year.\nThe rate hikes come at a time of slowing growth in the U.S., which has seen consecutive quarters of negative GDP readings, a common definition of recession.\nEven with the slowing trend, markets are pricing in another half percentage point rate hike from the Fed in September, though the chances of a third consecutive 0.75 percentage point move are rising.\n\"We're going to follow the data very carefully, and I think we'll get it right,\" Bullard said."},

The housing market has had a severe shortage for years. Strong demand during the coronavirus pandemic exacerbated it.\n\nHome prices are still higher than they were a year ago, but the gains slowed at the fastest pace on record in June, according to Black Knight, a mortgage software, data and analytics firm that began tracking this metric in the early 1970s. The annual rate of price appreciation fell two percentage points from 19.3% to 17.3%.\n\nRising mortgage rates and inflation in the wider economy caused housing demand to drop sharply in June, forcing home prices to cool down.\n\nEven when home prices crashed dramatically during the recession of 2007-09, the strongest single-month slowdown was 1.19 percentage points. Prices are not expected to fall nationally, given a stronger overall housing market, but higher mortgage rates are certainly taking their toll.\n\nThe average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage crossed above 6% in June, according to Mortgage News Daily. It has since dropped back into the lower 5% range, but that is still significantly higher than the 3% range rates were in at the start of this year.\n\n\"The slowdown was broad-based among the top 50 markets at the metro level, with some areas experiencing even more pronounced cooling,\" said Ben Graboske, president of Black Knight Data & Analytics. \"In fact, 25% of major U.S. markets saw growth slow by three percentage points in June, with four decelerating by four or more points in that month alone.\"\n\nStill, while this was the sharpest cooling on record nationally, the market would have to see six more months of this kind of deceleration for price growth to return to long-run averages, according to Graboske. He calculates that it takes about five months for interest rate impacts to be fully reflected in home prices.\n\nMarkets seeing the sharpest drops are those that previously had the highest prices in the nation. Average home values in San Jose, California, have fallen 5.1% in the last two months, the biggest drop of any of the top markets.

Tight underwriting and several years of strong price appreciation caused home equity levels to hit record highs.\n\nDespite that, the strong demand in the market recently could present a problem for some.

On Thursday, the producer price index surprisingly fell 0.5% in July from the prior month, compared with an estimate of a 0.2% gain, according to a Dow Jones survey. On an annual basis, the index rose 9.8%, the lowest rate since October 2021. That followed encouraging data that showed consumer prices rose 8.5% in July. The rate was slightly cooler than the 8.7% expected by analysts surveyed by Dow Jones and a slowing pace from the prior month. As both CPI and PPI soften, markets have started to moderate their expectations for Fed rate hikes. Still, the positive data doesn't mean it is \"mission complete\" for the Fed, said Ben Emons, managing director of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors. \"If you strip off any of the headline noise, some of the\u2026 CPI, even PPI [numbers] show still upward pressures,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Friday. \"The Fed cannot be done here.

Lucas Schifres | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 China's tourist-heavy province of Hainan is falling further behind lofty growth goals it set in January. Back then, the island said it aimed for 9% GDP growth this year. But like China's economy overall, growth is running far below initial targets \u2014 due in a large part to outbreaks of a far more transmissible Covid variant. A surge in Covid infections this month forced Hainan's oceanside resort city of Sanya to order tens of thousands of tourists to stay put at their hotels, and local residents to stay at home. Haikou, the province's capital, also issued stay-home orders. Airlines cancelled flights, leaving tourists stranded on Hainan island since Saturday. In the last few days, some people have been able to return to the mainland on government-organized charter flights. But questions remain \u2014 about uniform implementation of hotel stay subsidies, the cost of food and how soon most tourists can return to their homes.\n\n\"The public image and reputation of Hainan is damaged for the short term,\" said Jacques Penhirin, a partner in the Greater China office of Oliver Wyman. \"When I talk to the client they're all looking at the bookings for [the upcoming fall holiday] which are still quite resilient. People have not cancelled yet, but it's not looking good. Probably down on last year.\" It's \"going to be bad for luxury brands and hospitality at least until Chinese New Year next year,\" he said, referring to the Lunar New Year holiday in late January 2023.\n\nHainan's economy\n\nIn late July, China's top leaders indicated the country might miss the GDP target of around 5.5% set in March. Beijing did not signal any large-scale stimulus, or any change to its \"dynamic zero-Covid\" policy. The national economy grew by just 2.5% in the first half of the year, according to official figures. Hainan's economy underperformed even that sluggish pace, only growing by 1.6% in the first half of 2022. That's a sharp slowdown from the island's 11.2% GDP growth for all of 2021. In fact, Hainan's growth last year was second only to that of Hubei province, pointed out Ying Zhang, research analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nRead more about China from CNBC Pro JPMorgan says buy this undervalued Chinese biopharma stock that can rally more than 40% from here\n\n\"Because of the international travel restriction, Hainan has benefited from the tourism revenue, up by nearly 60% last year,\" she said. Zhang estimates tourism accounts for more than 80% of Hainan's economy. Sanya, on the southern coast of Hainan, was the top destination for couples flying from three of China's largest cities last week for China's version of Valentine's Day, according to booking site Trip.com. The island boasts one of the few beachfront locations for international luxury hotels like Mandarin Oriental and Hyatt in mainland China. Hainan is also building out duty-free shopping malls as part of central government's push to turn the island into a free trade hub and international shopping area. Sales at duty-free stores on the island surged by 84% last year to 60.17 billion yuan ($8.93 billion), according to official figures. During a consumer goods expo in Hainan in late July, sales at four duty-free stores rose by 27% year-on-year to 330 million yuan, the customs agency said.\n\nAnother hit to confidence\n\nSo far, cosmetics brands rely far more on Hainan for sales than affordable luxury brands \u2014 potentially up to a third of their China business, said Oliver Wyman's Penhirin. He said Hainan generally accounts for less than 5% of China sales for affordable luxury brands, while high-end luxury has yet to enter that market. An Oliver Wyman survey in May found that after roughly two months of lockdown in the metropolis of Shanghai, respondents from luxury and premium consumer brands cut their China growth expectations for the year by 15 percentage points.\n\nTens of thousands of tourists were stranded in the resort city of Sanya, Hainan, this week as local Covid outbreaks prompted airlines to cancel flights.

The index rose 1% from May, tying its biggest monthly gain since February 1981.\n\nExcluding food and energy, so-called core PCE increased 4.8% from a year ago, up one-tenth of a percentage point from May but off the recent high of 5.3% hit in February. On a monthly basis, core was up 0.6%, its biggest monthly gain since April 2021.\n\nBoth core readings were 0.1 percentage point above the Dow Jones estimates.\n\nFed officials generally focus on core inflation, but have turned their attention recently to the headline numbers as well, as food and fuel prices have soared in 2022.\n\nThe BEA release also showed that personal consumption expenditures, a gauge of consumer spending, increased 1.1% for the month, above the 0.9% estimate and owing largely to the surge in prices. Real spending adjusted for inflation increased just 0.1% as consumers barely kept up with inflation. Personal income rose 0.6%, topping the 0.5% estimate, but disposable income adjusted for inflation fell 0.3%.\n\nEarlier this month, data showed the consumer price index rose 9.1% from a year ago, the biggest gain since November 1981. The Fed prefers PCE over CPI as a broader measure of inflation pressures. CPI indicates the change in the out-of-pocket expenditures of urban households, while the PCE index measures the price change in goods and services consumed by all households, as well as nonprofit institutions serving households.\n\nThere was other bad inflation news Thursday.\n\nThe employment cost index, another figure Fed policymakers follow closely, rose 1.3% in the second quarter. That represented a slight decline from the 1.4% gain in the previous quarter, but was ahead of the 1.1% estimate. Further, the 5.1% increase on a 12-month basis marked a record for a data series that goes back to the first quarter of 2002.\n\n\"The rest of the economy might be slowing down, but wages are speeding up,\" said Nick Bunker, economic research director at job placement site Indeed. \"Competition for workers remains fierce as employers have to keep bidding up wages for new hires. These red-hot wage growth statistics may fade in the near term, but there's a long way for them to drop.\"\n\nThe Fed has been using a recipe of rate increases and a reduction in asset holdings to bring down prices that have soared to their highest levels since the Reagan administration and have helped cool consumer spending.\n\nPrivate sector wage gains of 1.6% for the quarter are \"seriously disappointing\" for the Fed, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nThe Fed follows the ECI figures because they adjust for compositional effects, or imbalances between gains from higher- and lower-wage workers, as well as other factors.\n\n\"Wage gains at this pace are far too high for the Fed, because they would require implausible rapid productivity growth in order to be consistent with the inflation target in the medium-term,\" Shepherdson wrote.\n\nFed officials earlier this week approved a second consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase in the central bank's benchmark interest rate. Inflation by any measure has been running well above the Fed's 2% longer-run target, and Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is \"strongly committed\" to bringing inflation down.\n\nIn normal times, the Fed focuses on inflation excluding food and energy costs because they are so volatile and don't always reflect longer-run trends. But Powell acknowledged Wednesday that policymakers need to be attentive to both types of inflation in the current environment.\n\n\"Core inflation is a better predictor of inflation going forward, headline inflation tends to be volatile. So, in ordinary times, you look through volatile moves in commodities,\" he said. \"The problem with the current situation is that if you have a sustained period of supply shocks, those can actually start to undermine or to work on de-anchoring inflation expectations.
