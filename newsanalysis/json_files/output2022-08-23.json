German benchmark electricity price jumped >25% on Monday to pass \u20ac700 per megawatt-hour for the first time. The level is about 14 times the seasonal average over the past five years. pic.twitter.com/gMQZkk7ncB \u2014 Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) August 22, 2022\n\nJim Reid of Deutsche Bank told clients that the energy crisis had intensified.\n\nStarting in Europe, the energy crisis intensified yet further, after news over the weekend that Nord Stream would be shut for maintenance at the end of the month introduced fresh fears it would not re-open. European natural gas prices ratcheted +14.59% higher to \u20ac280/MWH, a record high. German power prices surged +18.60% to another record as well, closing at \u20ac663 and breaching \u20ac700/MWH intraday for the first time ever.\n\nThis summer\u2019s heatwaves have already strained Europe\u2019s energy supplies. Such high prices will hurt households badly, while disruption during the winter months could be devastating for business activity.\n\nTapas Strickland, a director of economics at National Australia Bank, says:\n\n\u201cEurope\u2019s dire energy situation suggests the peak of inflation is not here yet and the risk remains that high inflation is sticky for longer without further aggressive central bank action. \u201cNo surprise then to see the dollar at near multi-decade highs against a falling euro and British pound.\u201d\n\nthis is looking exponential now: pic.twitter.com/5eGpdCC6Ac \u2014 BionicBanker (@BrokenBanker) August 22, 2022\n\nWhile energy shortage fears hit the euro, the dollar is in demand. Traders are anticipating the Federal Reserve will continue to lift US interest rates to battle inflation, despite the slowdown in the global economy.\n\nTraders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last night. Photograph: Brendan McDermid/Reuters\n\nWall Street saw its worst day since June last night, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 2% as the summer rally fizzled out.\n\nAlso coming up today\n\nThe latest surveys of purchasing managers across Europe will show the damage caused by soaring energy prices and extreme weather this summer, including low water levels on the Rhine.\n\nAugust\u2019s flash purchasing managers surveys are expected to show that eurozone factories shrank again this month, while the services sector struggled.\n\nMichael Hewson of CMC Markets has the details:\n\nSurging energy prices, along with sharply declining water levels on the Rhine have cut the rug out from the manufacturing sector in Germany with today\u2019s August flash PMI expected to see a further decline from 49.3 to 48, while services activity is also expected to slip further from 49.7 to 49. In France the picture isn\u2019t any better, although the services sector is benefitting from a bit of a tourism boost, however the forest fires could well pull economic activity here down quite a lot more. In manufacturing economic activity is likely to slip to 49, from 49.5, while services could slip from 53.2 by a lot more than the 53 that is currently being forecast.\n\nIn the UK, the picture is slightly better, but the PMI survey could show a slowdown in growth.\n\nWith August being a slow period due to holidays, we could well start to see economic activity on the PMI level start to slide into contraction territory, from 52.1 for manufacturing in July and from 52.6 for services in July.\n\nThe agenda\n\n9am BST: Eurozone flash manufacturing and services PMI survey for August\n\n9.30am BST: UK flash manufacturing and services PMI survey for August\n\n11am BST: CBI survey of industrial trends\n\n2.45pm BST: US flash manufacturing and services PMI survey for August\n\n3pm BST: Eurozone consumer confidence survey for August\n\n3pm BST: US new home sales for July",

        "text": "Inflation in the UK will hit 18% early next year as consumers count the cost of the deepening energy crisis, one of the world\u2019s biggest banks has predicted.\n\nThe US financial services group Citi said it expected the consumer prices index to breach 18% in the first quarter of 2023, while the retail prices index inflation rate would soar to 21%.\n\nCiti\u2019s prediction is significantly higher than previous modelling of the impact of rising costs. Earlier this month the Bank of England said it expected inflation to reach 13% by the end of the year, while the Resolution Foundation thinktank has forecast it could reach as high as 15% by early 2023.\n\nThe last time UK inflation reached 18% was in 1976 when an oil supply shock ripped through the global economy and left the UK seeking a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe climbing forecasts have put pressure on the Conservative leadership candidates to say how they would tackle inflation. Liz Truss released a plan to \u201cput the West Midlands at the heart of our economic revival\u201d on Monday night, without mentioning inflation. Rishi Sunak set out his own plans to make the UK a science superpower and to replace the Horizon research programme, from which Britain has been frozen out after Brexit. But his campaign had earlier warned that Truss\u2019s plans for tax cuts could create an \u201cinflation spiral\u201d.\n\nLabour said inflation was a global problem but \u201cworse in the UK than elsewhere due to Conservative mismanagement over the past 12 years\u201d.\n\nPat McFadden, the shadow Treasury minister, said: \u201cWith each passing day there is a new survey saying energy prices will rise even higher than expected and with them, inflation too. People simply cannot afford the rises projected to hit them in the coming months. That is why Labour has proposed freezing energy bills over the coming winter, saving households \u00a31,000 and protecting them from rocketing prices.\u201d\n\nCiti is highly regarded for its economic forecasting, working with the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank on its regular \u201cgreen budget\u201d analysis.\n\nBenjamin Nabarro, the chief UK economist at Citi, said its forecasts had been updated after a 25% and 7% rise in UK gas and electricity prices respectively last week.\n\nConditions in the gas market worsened on Monday in response to Russian state-owned operator Gazprom announcing unscheduled maintenance on the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline into Europe.\n\nThe price of gas for next-day delivery to the UK shot up 37% to 495p a therm at one point, the highest since March. The month-ahead gas price touched record highs, up 16% to 540p a therm.\n\nIn Europe, the gas price according to the TTF benchmark rose more than 10% to a high of \u20ac290 (\u00a3245) a megawatt hour, and in France the year-ahead electricity price surged to more than \u20ac800 a megawatt hour, up from just over \u20ac100 at the start of the year.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ofgem, the energy regulator for Great Britain, will announce the level of the next price cap on Friday.\n\nThe US bank predicted that the cap would rise to \u00a34,567 in January \u2013 about \u00a3300 higher than some forecasts \u2013 before reaching \u00a35,816 in April.\n\nEnergy bills have rocketed this year as high wholesale gas prices, in part down to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, have fed through into bills.\n\nThe government is examining options to tackle the crisis, including ramping up an existing support package, which gives \u00a3400 to every household from October, and a \u201ctariff deficit scheme\u201d pushed by suppliers.\n\nBill Bullen, the chief executive of Utilita, on Monday called for the Conservative party to end its leadership contest early so that the energy crisis could be tackled immediately.\n\nCiti said it expected at least a \u00a3300 reduction in bills as a result of an anticipated cut to VAT on household energy bills and a suspending of green levies on bills.\n\nHowever, it added: \u201cIn reality, any government response to this is likely to involve substantially more fiscal firepower (around \u00a340bn in our view).\u201d\n\nCiti analysts said offsetting the energy increase in full would cost \u00a330bn, equivalent to 1.4% GDP, for the next six months. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has presented a \u00a329bn plan to freeze bills for six months.\n\nAnalysts at RBC said global gas traders including Shell would benefit from higher prices, as well as the power station owner Drax and the energy group SSE.\n\nOn Monday, Europe was due to receive its first cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Australia in six years, arriving at the Isle of Grain terminal in Kent. The Attalos gas tanker was poised to bring in LNG for use immediately in the UK as well as export to Europe.\n\nAsked about the possibility of blackouts this winter, Downing Street downplayed concerns. A No 10 spokesperson said: \u201cHouseholds, businesses and industry can be confident they will get the electricity and gas that they need over the winter. That\u2019s because we have one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems in the world.\u201d\n\nShe said consumers should not panic or feel they should cut down on energy use. \u201cThese decisions, in terms of energy consumption, remain decisions for individuals. But what I\u2019m saying is that households, businesses and industry can be confident that they will have the electricity and gas that they need.\u201d",

Accounting for these developments, as well as updating our own weights for CPI/ RPI and honing our own accounting for curve backwardation, we now expect CPI inflation to peak at over 18% in January. RPI inflation, we think, will peak at over 20%.\n\nCiti\u2019s UK inflation forecasts Photograph: Citi\n\nCPI inflation jumped to 10.1% in July, a 40-year high.\n\nThe question now is what policy may do to offset the impact on both inflation and the real economy, Nabarro adds:\n\nFor now, we think [Liz] Truss\u2019s comments point to only a limited offset for headline inflation. Though the risks remain skewed towards further support.\n\nEarlier this month the Bank of England forecast that UK inflation will peak over 13% this autumn when the energy price cap is lifted.\n\nWholesale gas prices have continued to rise through August, as Vladimir Putin has \u2018weaponised\u2019 Russia\u2019s energy supplies.\n\nAs flagged earlier, they\u2019ve surged this morning as Gazprom prepares to shut down its Nord Stream 1 pipeline for three days at the end of this month.\n\nThe FT points out that if UK inflation hits 18%, that would be higher than the peak of inflation after the second Opec oil shock of 1979 when CPI reached 17.8%, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics.\n\nNEW: UK inflation projected to hit 18.6 per cent in January, according to a new Citi report https://t.co/89sApc7FhU \u2014 Matthew Garrahan (@MattGarrahan) August 22, 2022",

        "text": "Morgan Stanley is betting on a few Chinese stocks \u2014 such as technology and materials companies \u2014 to ride out what's expected to be a period of high market volatility. The investment firm prefers mainland China stocks to those listed offshore, equity strategist Laura Wang said in an Aug. 15 report about the bank's positioning in Chinese equities in the third quarter. Mainland China's CSI 300 index has outperformed the MSCI China stock index by 20 percentage points since mid-November, she said. MSCI China's top holdings are Chinese stocks listed mostly in Hong Kong, such as Tencent and Alibaba . Wang noted how the MSCI China index is most sensitive to sectors affected by regulatory uncertainty, and is experiencing its longest bear market in its 20-year history. She expects the property market slump , downward earnings revisions, potential Covid outbreaks and uncertainty around U.S.-China tensions to likely keep market volatility elevated. In the interim, she said the firm recommends remaining overweight on materials companies. \"We also like information technology, which enjoys a continuous policy tailwind, and Utilities for defensiveness,\" Wang said. For each of those three sectors, CNBC selected the stock on the bank's China/Hong Kong focus list with the greatest potential upside to undisclosed price targets as of Aug. 11, per Morgan Stanley's analysts. All three are rated overweight by the investment bank. Technology: Glodon Potential upside: 59.8% Glodon is a construction software company with products that include building design and cost estimation tools. The company claimed net profit attributable to shareholders doubled last year to 661 million yuan ($97.3 million). The Shenzhen-traded shares are down by more than 10% over the last six months, but have posted gains over the last three months. Materials: Ganfeng Lithium Potential upside: 58.8% Ganfeng Lithium is a giant supplier of lithium for electric car batteries. The company said its net profit attributable to shareholders soared by 410% last year to 5.23 billion yuan ($770.21 million). However, the stock plunged this year. The company's Hong Kong-listed shares are down by about 24% over the last three months. Ganfeng and Glodon have both outperformed the MSCI China Index since Morgan Stanley added them to their focus list, according to the bank's report. Utilities: Kunlun Energy Potential upside: 47.3% Kunlun Energy focuses on natural gas processing and transport. The company is controlled by state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation. Kunlun said its profit attributable to shareholders surged by nearly 280% to 23.02 billion yuan last year. The company's Hong Kong-traded shares are down by about 12% over the last three months. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

Brandon Bell | Getty Images\n\nJuly's consumer price index report finally showed a sign of potential relief \u2013 inflation ticked up less than expected from a year ago, and was flat on the month, meaning that a basket of items and services generally stayed the same price. But some items have fallen, on a monthly and weekly basis, potentially signaling that inflation has passed its peak and may be cooling off. This is welcome news to consumers who have been squeezed by higher prices and are looking for any sign of relief. Some of the top items whose prices have come down include eggs, milk and gasoline.\n\n\"Fuel inflation was really big and that's going to have a pretty meaningful impact on consumers and their spending patterns,\" said John Leer, chief economist at Morning Consult. \"I think that's actually a good thing for the economy.\"\n\nGrocery aisle prices down\n\nMany of the items that have declined are tied to food and energy, often the most volatile costs that consumers deal with. Grocery store staples have dipped. Large white eggs cost, on average, $2.14 for a dozen, during the week of Aug. 15-21, according to the USDA. That's a whopping 60 cent drop from the prior week, when the average was $2.74 per dozen.\n\nThe average price for a gallon of milk slipped to $3.16 from $3.24 during the period of Aug. 8-12 from the previous month, and the average price of butter fell to $3.67 from $4.68 in the same timeframe, per USDA data. Chicken breast prices also slipped on a weekly basis during the period of Aug. 8-12, but other parts of the chicken are declining as well \u2013 chicken wing prices have been trending down and are now cost less than they did pre-pandemic, according to data from the Department of Agriculture.\n\nOil pulled down fuel prices\n\nOutside of food, declines can be seen in consumer goods and services related to energy. This is because oil prices are often subject to big price swings as the balance between supply and demand shifts. This year, the war between Russia and Ukraine threw that balance off and the price of oil spiked when countries stopped buying from Russia, a major exporter. However, oil prices have come back down, lowering the cost of energy and particularly gasoline. The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline is $3.918 as of Friday, according to AAA. While that's higher than it was a year ago, it's a solid decline from the $4.495 consumers were paying for gas a month ago, and a sharp drop from the recent high of $5.016 hit in June.\n\nI think consumers increasingly believe that inflation is going to come down. John Leer chief economist at Morning Consult\n\nThat also potentially affected another area of the economy that saw a price dip month over month \u2013 airfares. The average price of a domestic airline ticket has dropped to $295 in August from $332 in July, according to travel site Hopper. That's also back in-line with the average price for a domestic ticket in the same month in 2019. Outside of fuel costs, this dip in ticket prices could be because consumer demand is fading, according to according to Kevin Gordon, a senior investment research manager at Schwab. \"That could be demand destruction,\" he said, adding that the reopening from pandemic lockdowns inflated the price of things as consumers rushed to take vacations again. Now, as vacation season is winding down, that demand has fallen off.\n\nOne month doesn't make a trend",

        "text": "Liz Truss will plunge the economy into an \u201cinflation spiral\u201d if she does not choose between her unfunded \u00a350bn tax cuts and providing cost of living support, her Conservative party leadership opponent, Rishi Sunak, has claimed.\n\nSunak\u2019s leadership campaign said Truss would increase borrowing to \u201chistoric and dangerous levels\u201d and place public finances into \u201cserious jeopardy\u201d if she attempted to do both.\n\nThe comments came after Truss, the frontrunner to be the next prime minister, signalled another U-turn with direct support for companies and households amid soaring energy bills this winter.\n\nIn a statement, Sunak\u2019s campaign said: \u201cFollowing weeks of rejecting direct support payments as \u2018handouts\u2019, Truss supporters have slowly woken up to the reality of what winter brings. They now say that they will provide people with help \u2013 but what help, for who, when and how it will be paid for remains a mystery.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that Truss cannot deliver a support package as well as come good on \u00a350bn worth of unfunded, permanent tax cuts in one go. To do so would mean increasing borrowing to historic and dangerous levels, putting the public finances in serious jeopardy and plunging the economy into an inflation spiral.\u201d\n\nAn ally of Sunak\u2019s, Kevin Hollinrake, also suggested people would be homeless \u201con the streets\u201d without further help to pay energy bills this winter.\n\nThe MP for Thirsk and Malton told Sky News that promises by Truss\u2019s campaign to cut taxes would provide only an extra \u201cpound a week\u201d to the poorest households, whereas it would provide \u201cto the tune of about 30 a week\u201d to a household like his.\n\n\u201cIt is simply not right,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people are going to be on the streets. Things are going to be that bad for some households.\u201d\n\nThe row comes before Ofgem\u2019s announcement on Friday when the regulator is expected to increase the cap on energy bills from \u00a31,971 to about \u00a33,600.\n\nThe former chancellor\u2019s team also commented on reports that Truss was not planning to ask the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) for a forecast ahead of the emergency budget she is planning for next month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder they want to avoid independent scrutiny of the OBR in their emergency budget \u2013 they know you can\u2019t do both and it\u2019s time they came clean about that now,\u201d Sunak\u2019s campaign said.\n\nAnother Sunak supporter, Mel Stride, said Truss\u2019s plans for an emergency budget needed to be transparent and affordable so ministers were not \u201cflying blind\u201d.\n\nThe Commons Treasury committee chair told LBC: \u201cAt the moment the Liz camp are saying I believe that there will not be any OBR forecast produced at that time and that is kind of like flying blind.\n\n\u201cIt means that you do all these dramatic things on tax etc but you don\u2019t actually know what the independent forecaster believes the impact will be on the public finances and I think that is quite a serious situation were that to come about.\u201d\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As winter approaches, millions of families will be concerned about how they are going to make ends meet. But I want to reassure the British people that help is coming.\u201d\n\nTruss expressed optimism for the economy, saying there was \u201ctoo much talk that there\u2019s going to be a recession\u201d as she insisted an economic slump was not inevitable despite the Bank of England\u2019s forecast.\n\nIn an interview with the Sun on Sunday, she said she was looking at help \u201cacross the board\u201d in a hint that there could be more support for businesses and households.\n\nSo far she has focused on cutting taxes, such as an immediate reversal of the national insurance increase, while Sunak has focused on trying to bring down soaring inflation.",

        "text": "Taken together, the results show that the robust sales retailers grew accustomed to during the course of the pandemic have ceased \u2014 and the consumer landscape that awaits may be more austere than what they prepared for. (There were exceptions. Home Depot, for instance, said sales were still strong, driven by home improvement projects.) On earnings calls, executives said lower- to middle-income consumers were the most hesitant to spend. Stores are responding by pushing more discounts and highlighting private-label brand to shoppers, and, in some cases, canceling billions of dollars\u2019 worth of orders with vendors. It remains to be seen which strategies will be most effective.\n\nInflation F.A.Q. Card 1 of 5 Inflation F.A.Q. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. Inflation F.A.Q. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Inflation F.A.Q. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. Inflation F.A.Q. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Inflation F.A.Q. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe last two years was great for retailers because consumers were buying everything they had to offer,\u201d Liza Amlani, founder of Retail Strategy Group, which works with brands on their merchandising and planning strategies. \u201cThey just can\u2019t do that anymore. You have to understand what the consumer wants more now than ever.\u201d\n\nIn July, U.S. retail sales were virtually unchanged, according to data from the Commerce Department released Wednesday. Excluding the sales of gas and cars, retail sales actually increased 0.7 percent. But 85 percent of U.S. consumers said that inflation is altering the way they shop, according to a survey released this week from Morning Consult.\n\nMost retailers are hoping this pullback period is only temporary. In the meantime, companies are trying to signal to customers that it\u2019s worth doing what spending they do in their stores. Kohl\u2019s, for instance, said that its private-label brands outperformed the national ones it carries last quarter, and that shoppers gravitated toward buying more basic apparel that could be worn with many different outfits.",

        "text": "A high street decorated with British Union Jack bunting in Penistone, UK. The End Fuel Poverty Coalition has warned \"a tsunami of fuel poverty will hit the country this winter.\" Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nLONDON \u2014 Facing soaring energy bills, rising costs and rapidly declining consumer purchasing power, small businesses across the U.K. are struggling to make ends meet. New data on Wednesday showed U.K. inflation jumped to a 40-year high of 10.1% in July as food and energy costs continued to soar, exacerbating the country's cost-of-living crisis. The Bank of England expects consumer price inflation to top out at 13.3% in October, with the country's average energy bills (set via a price cap) expected to rise sharply in the fourth quarter to eventually exceed an annual \u00a34,266 ($5,170) in early 2023. On Wednesday, a director of U.K. energy regulator Ofgem quit over its decision to add hundreds of pounds to household bills, accusing the watchdog of failing to strike the \"right balance between the interests of consumers and the interests of suppliers.\" Real wages in the U.K. fell by an annual 3% in the second quarter of 2022, the sharpest decline on record, as wage increases failed to keep pace with the surging cost of living. A new survey published Friday also showed consumer confidence falling to its lowest level since records began in 1974. 'Absolute madness' \"While the energy price caps do not apply to businesses directly, millions of small business owners are still experiencing increased energy bills at a time when costs are rising in most operational areas,\" said Alan Thomas, U.K. CEO at insurance firm Simply Business. \"Simultaneously, consumer purchasing power is going down as Brits cut back on non-essential spending, harming the books of SME [small and medium-sized enterprise] owners.\" This assessment was echoed by Christopher Gammon, e-commerce manager at Lincs Aquatics \u2014 a Lincolnshire-based store and warehouse providing aquariums, ponds and marine livestock. The business has seen its energy costs rise by 90% so far since the war in Ukraine began, Gammon told CNBC on Thursday, and its owners are provisioning for further increases in the coming months.\n\n\"We are combating the rising cost with switching everything to LED, solar panels, wind turbines (planning in process) and closing down unused systems,\" Gammon said. \"We have also had to increase the price of products \u2014 most of these have been livestock as they are now costing more to look after.\" Customers are increasingly withdrawing from keeping fish and reptiles due to the cost of maintenance, and on Wednesday the store had a customer bring in a snake they could no longer afford to care for. The spiraling costs forced Lincs Aquatics to close a store in East Yorkshire, laying off several workers, while trying to offer pay rises to staff at its two remaining locations in Lincolnshire in order to help them through the crisis. The business is also working to expand its online shop due to rising in-store upkeep costs, as heating water for marine aquariums and purchasing pump equipment become ever more expensive. In early July, a quarterly survey from the British Chambers of Commerce found that 82% of businesses in the U.K. saw inflation as a growing concern for their business, with growth in sales, investment intentions and longer-term turnover confidence all slowing.\n\n\"Businesses face an unprecedented convergence of cost pressures, with the main drivers coming from raw materials, fuel, utilities, taxes, and labor,\" said BCC Head of Research David Bharier. \"The continuing supply chain crisis, exacerbated by conflict in Ukraine and lockdowns in China, has further compounded this.\" BCC Director General Shevaun Haviland added that \"the red lights on our economic dashboard are starting to flash,\" with almost every indicator deteriorating since the March survey. Phil Speed, an independent distributor for multiservice company Utility Warehouse, based in Skegness, England, liaises with brokers to find energy deals for business clients. He told CNBC earlier this week that for the first time in 10 years, he had been unable to obtain a better deal for a client than their out-of-contract rate \u2014 the typically expensive rates paid when a business or individual does not have a contracted deal in place. \"I think the unit rate she was quoting was 60p [pence] a unit for gas, which is just ridiculous. I'd imagine a year ago, we'd have been looking at 5 or 6p. It's just absolute madness,\" Speed said. \"We've got no idea what's going to be presented to us, because we've got no idea what's going to happen. The price is just going ballistic. No-one's going to buy it.\" The cost of gas for both businesses and consumers are only expected to increase through the colder winter months. Speed noted that local cafes cooking on gas will likely struggle, as they have no choice but to continue using it, unless they can replace gas appliances with electric ones. 'Scream very loudly at somebody' Rail strikes have already brought the country to a halt on multiple days throughout the summer and look set to continue, while postal workers, telecoms engineers and dock workers have all voted to strike as inflation erodes real wages. Conservative leadership favorite Liz Truss was earlier this month forced into a dramatic U-turn on a plan to cut public sector pay outside London, which would have axed wages for teachers, nurses, police and the armed forces alike. Local authorities recently offered state school support staff a flat pay rise of \u00a31,925 per year, meaning a 10.5% increase for the lowest-paid staff and just over 4% for the highest earners, after pressure from three of the country's largest unions. One woman in her early fifties \u2013 a member of support staff at a state school in Lincolnshire who asked not to be named due to the sensitive situation and concerns on public reprisals \u2013 told CNBC that years of real-terms pay cuts had left many low-paid public sector workers struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe British government in 2010, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, announced a two-year pay freeze for public sector workers, followed by a 1% average cap on public sector pay awards which was lifted in 2017, with average pay rises increasing to roughly 2% by 2020. While the 10.5% rise for the lowest-paid school support staff will ease the pressure, the woman said her energy costs had doubled and her private landlord had attempted to increase her rent by \u00a340 per month, which she had not agreed to and which may mean she would need to sell her car to cover basic living expenses. She called on the government to temporarily reduce the \"standing charge,\" a fixed daily amount households have to pay on most gas and electricity bills no matter how much they actually use, and to up its efforts to recoup one-off \"windfall taxes\" from energy companies such as BP, Shell and Centrica, which are reporting record profits.. \"I think this is an even bigger crisis than [the Covid-19 pandemic], because this is going to affect not just lower earners, but maybe even middle earners as well, because I don't see how anybody can absorb those kinds of energy costs,\" she said.",

In the comments, she attempted to explain the lower productivity seen outside London as being due to \u201ca mindset and attitude thing\u201d.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I don\u2019t think people are that keen to change that.\u201d\n\nTruss added that there was a \u201cslight thing in Britain about wanting the easy answers\u201d, before saying: \u201cBut actually what needs to happen is more \u2026 more graft. It\u2019s not a popular message.\u201d\n\nAsked about her remarks this weekend, Truss told the Sun on Sunday: \u201cI\u2019ve always been passionate about helping our country become more successful. I want people to have opportunities. Of course I believe in hard work.\n\n\u201cI want our government to be on the side of people that work hard who set up their own businesses.\u201d\n\nLabour has said Truss\u2019s remarks made while she was a Treasury minister were \u201cgrossly offensive\u201d, saying that she had effectively called British workers \u201clazy\u201d.",

Amazon.com (AMZN) and UnitedHealth (UNH) are now said to be among the bidders, according to The Wall Street Journal, which had previously reported that CVS Health (CVS) was eyeing Signify.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) \u2013 Bed Bath & Beyond is sliding another 10.2% in premarket trading after Friday's more than 40% plunge. That sell-off followed news that investor Ryan Cohen had sold his shares in the housewares retailer. Bloomberg is also reporting that certain suppliers have halted shipments to Bed Bath & Beyond due to unpaid bills.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) \u2013 The movie theater chain's stock plummeted 30.6% in the premarket ahead of the debut of AMC's so-called \"APE\" preferred equity units. CEO Adam Aron tweeted a reminder to investors that the total value of their AMC holdings would be a combination of the regular shares plus the new units, which were granted as a special dividend. AMC shares have also been pressured by the financial troubles surrounding Cineworld, the British parent of U.S. movie theater chain Regal Cinemas.\n\nFord (F) \u2013 Ford lost 2.8% in the premarket following a Friday jury ruling assessing a $1.7 billion verdict against the automaker. The case involved a fatal crash that centered on the roof strength in older model Super Duty pickup trucks.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) \u2013 Occidental Petroleum gave back 1.4% in premarket action following a nearly 10% gain Friday. That followed news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) had received permission from regulators to buy up to 50% of the energy producer. Berkshire is already Occidental's largest shareholder.\n\nTesla (TSLA) \u2013 Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the price of the company's Full Self Driving software would rise by $3,000 to $15,000 next month, following the wide release of an updated version of the software. Tesla shares fell 2.1% in the premarket.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) \u2013 Netflix fell 2.4% in premarket trading after CFRA downgraded the stock to \"sell\" from \"hold.\" The firm said Netflix is likely to underperform the S&P 500 after surging 40% from its mid-July lows.\n\nVF Corp. (VFC) \u2013 VF was downgraded to \"market perform\" from \"outperform\" at Cowen, which cited uncertainty about VF's upbeat guidance for its Vans footwear and apparel brand. VF slid 2.6% in premarket action.\n\nDocuSign (DOCU) \u2013 The electronic signature company was downgraded to \"sector perform\" from \"outperform\" at RBC Capital. RBC sees a long path to a turnaround amid execution issues and the current absence of a permanent CEO, among other issues. DocuSign fell 4.5% in premarket trading.",

If, as expected, Liz Truss is elected next month, she would take power during a period of economic stress comparable to what Thatcher confronted.\n\nAnd yet the multiple shocks Britain faces \u2014 from soaring energy prices because of the war in Ukraine, supply-chain disruptions after the coronavirus pandemic, and the hollowing out of the British labor market by Brexit \u2014 seem strangely disconnected from the contest to replace Prime Minister Boris Johnson.",

        "text": "Initial filings for unemployment benefits declined slightly last week though they were consistent with a drift higher in layoffs that began in the spring, the Labor Department reported Thursday.\n\nJobless claims totaled 250,000 for the week ended Aug. 13, down 2,000 from the previous week and below the 260,000 Dow Jones estimate.\n\nThe four-week moving average for claims, which helps smooth out weekly volatility, also fell by 2,750 to 246,750.\n\nEarlier this year, claims had hit their lowest level in more than 50 years, but began moving higher in April after bottoming at 166,000. The four-week moving average has risen during that time by nearly 80,000.\n\nContinuing claims, which run a week behind the headline number, totaled 1.437 million, an increase of 7,000.\n\nPolicymakers are watching the jobs market closely at a time when inflation is running near 40-year highs. Federal Reserve officials have instituted a series of interest rate increases aimed in part at cooling a labor market in which there are nearly two jobs open for every available worker.\n\nAt their July meeting, Fed officials noted \"tentative signs of a softening outlook for the labor market\" that included a rise in weekly claims, according to minutes released Wednesday. Policymakers said they were determined to continue to raise interest rates until inflation under control even if meant more a slowdown in hiring.\n\n\"Unfortunately, what's good for the American worker is bad for the Fed's attempt to being inflation back down to 2% and this will complicate their job and cause them to raise rates higher and for longer than many people currently expect,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Investor Alliance.\n\nIn other economic news Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed reported that its monthly manufacturing survey for August rose to a reading of 6.2, representing the percentage difference between companies expecting expansion vs. contraction. That was an improvement over July's minus-12.3.\n\nThe level was above the estimate for a minus-5 and helped quell fears that manufacturing might be headed for a major slowdown. A similar survey on Monday from the New York Fed fell a stunning 40 points as respondents indicated that business conditions were deteriorating.\n\nThe indexes for prices paid and received both declined on the month, though they remain well into territory that indicates inflation is still present. Hiring also improved as did new orders, though the latter still registered a reading of minus-5.1.",

        "text": "Boris Johnson has said he will not introduce any new measures to deal with the cost of living crisis. Big spending decisions are being delayed until his successor as prime minister is in post. However, the result of the Conservative leadership election will not be announced until 5 September.\n\nIn the meantime, a major increase in the regulated energy price cap, which puts a ceiling on gas and electricity bills, is due to be announced this Friday. It is forecast to rise from just under \u00a32,000, to \u00a33,600 a year for the average household.\n\nWhile the nation waits to hear whether any further help is coming, the Treasury is working on a menu of options. Here we outline the main ideas, and assess the political and economic impact of each one.\n\nTargeted help for the most vulnerable\n\nThe most limited option for the Treasury is to direct additional help for households to those on the lowest incomes, many of whom are already in fuel poverty and struggling even before the bill increases come in this winter. More than half of British households, 54%, will be in fuel poverty by October and more still in January.\n\nThe most targeted way of getting money to the most vulnerable is via increases in universal credit and pension credit. Liz Truss has also promised to reverse the national insurance rise \u2013 though many poorer households were not affected by that because the last cost of living intervention by Rishi Sunak as chancellor.\n\nJessica Elgot, chief political correspondent: This is the most likely level of support Truss is prepared to offer, citing the cost of the package from Sunak announced earlier this year and with the need to fund her promised tax cuts. She has called it \u201cGordon Brown economics\u201d to have a high tax burden and then high amounts of state help. But such a route would mean starting her premiership with tax cuts that benefit the wealthy and some additional aid for the poorest \u2013 meaning the majority of working people get very little. MPs are worried that is not a sound electoral strategy.\n\nRichard Partington, economics correspondent: Charities are calling for the existing \u00a31,200 energy support payment for 8 million households on means-tested benefits to be doubled. There is a strong economic case for such targeted support because poor families spend more of their budget on essentials \u2013 such as energy and food \u2013 than richer households, leaving them the most exposed to the inflation shock. The Resolution Foundation estimates a \u201ccost of living\u201d inflation rate for the poorest of 1.5 percentage points higher than for the richest.\n\nDouble the fuel discount from \u00a3400 to \u00a3800\n\nSunak announced earlier this year that eligible UK households would receive a \u00a3400 discount to help with energy bills from October. Officials have been looking at the potential for people to receive additional support, perhaps up to \u00a3800, because forecasts for price rises are now considerably higher.\n\nThe discount is easier to administer but somewhat of a blunt instrument because more well-off households will benefit from the discount.\n\nJessica Elgot: This looks more like the kind of package Sunak would back but Truss has said that she favours giving targeted support rather than increasing the \u00a3400 grant for every household, and her allies including the chief secretary to the Treasury, Simon Clarke, have been disparaging about the entire \u00a3400 scheme \u2013 though have said they would not cancel it.\n\nRichard Partington: The case against universal support is that many wealthier households saved money during the pandemic while working from home, with the Bank of England estimating about \u00a3180bn of \u201cexcess savings\u201d. With inflation the result of demand outstripping supply, some economists say putting more money in the pockets of those who can afford to keep spending will pour fuel on the inflationary fire. However, others say the scale of the energy shock requires more people than usual to receive support.\n\nScrapping VAT on energy bills\n\nThis measure, which was first proposed by Labour, is another option being worked on to reduce bills. VAT on domestic energy is charged at a rate of 5% and it would save a typical consumer \u00a3154 over the year, and cost the exchequer about \u00a34.3bn initially. Removing VAT would help those who face the biggest rise in their energy bills \u2013 those who consume the most.\n\nJessica Elgot: Sunak rejected this as chancellor but has made it a key part of his policy offer as a Conservative leadership candidate. This was widely pilloried by the Truss campaign as a screeching U-turn, making it difficult for her to adopt it in No 10 without losing face. But it has the advantage of enabling a new PM to talk up the measure as a \u201cBrexit freedom\u201d.\n\nRichard Partington: One consequence of higher energy bills is that the Treasury will rake in more than expected from the VAT charged on them. Giving some of this back to struggling families therefore makes sense. However, Sunak had previously worried that it would be difficult to put the tax back on again in future, which could cause trouble for the government\u2019s budget deficit amid weaker economic growth and rising spending pressures.\n\nSign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Start the day with the top stories from the US, plus the day\u2019s must-reads from across the Guardian Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA\n\nA new windfall tax\n\nNadhim Zahawi as chancellor has been candid with energy firms about the option for an expansion of the windfall tax on oil and gas companies announced by Sunak in May. Truss has said she is opposed to windfall taxes though Sunak has not ruled it out if he wins \u2013 though that seems unlikely.\n\nExtending the levy could raise \u00a34bn, providing some much needed leeway for the government to help with energy bills. Labour has said the existing windfall tax could be tightened to remove the option for energy firms to claim tax relief on more than 90% of the levy if the money is reinvested.\n\nJessica Elgot: There were raised eyebrows in both leadership camps when Zahawi started talking up the potential for a windfall tax. Truss and her likely future chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, are staunchly opposed to the tax, believing it makes Britain an unpredictable place for investment. Truss has also said profit is \u201cnot a dirty word\u201d. But there is mass public anger about extraordinary profits, which Zahawi has alluded to, so it may be an unpopular stance to defend them.\n\nRichard Partington: Continued high energy prices have helped the world\u2019s five biggest oil companies to bumper profits of nearly \u00a350bn, lining shareholders\u2019 pockets at the expense of consumers. This shows a clear case for a bigger windfall tax. However, chopping and changing the plan could undermine the argument that the policy is a one-off, potentially leading firms to reassess their investment plans.\n\nScrapping the price rise and absorbing the costs\n\nThis is the plan that is gaining momentum, backed by Labour and the Lib Dems, so it would be unusual if the Treasury was not beginning some preliminary work on the possibility. It would involve freezing the energy price cap at its current level of just under \u00a32,000 a year rather than allowing it to rise in line with global wholesale gas prices.\n\nLabour says the plan would cost just under \u00a330bn, although that\u2019s on the assumption that it would apply only for the next six months \u2013 so it may cost much more in the long term.\n\nJessica Elgot: Both candidates have ruled this out, despite overwhelming public support for the measure, which is backed by 85% of Tory voters. However, given past experience of the Tories dismissing and then adopting popular cost of living policies, it is not impossible this one could seem appealing in the cold light of day in September.\n\nRichard Partington: There are clear pros and cons. A universal cap could halt headline inflation from rising further, potentially saving the government money on inflation-linked borrowing. However, it would have a hefty price tag and need to be in place for a year (inflation is based on the 12-month change in consumer prices). Free-market economists argue it would destroy price signals; incentivising energy use, rather than lower consumption and investment in insulation. It would also benefit rich and poor alike.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\n\n\nDeficit fund for suppliers to cover fuel price rise\n\nThe idea has been suggested by the boss of ScottishPower that the government could set up a deficit fund to cover the difference between what people pay and how much it costs to supply their homes with gas and electricity.\n\nThe fund could be underwritten by the government, or a willing financial institution, and repaid over a 10 to 15 year period to smooth out the costs. Suppliers would be expected to use the period the scheme was in place to focus on investments in green energy while policymakers delink electricity prices from gas.\n\nJessica Elgot: This could be a way for Truss to U-turn on freezing prices while claiming it is a way to boost investment and get better value for taxpayers\u2019 money. But it would still require vast sums which she has said she is not prepared to spend \u2013 and that would be on top of additional billions of spending commitment she has made on tax cuts and defence.\n\nRichard Partington: Spreading energy bills over a longer time frame would ease some of the pain today, helping the economic outlook in the short-term. However, it would build up costs for the future, and would ultimately be a cost ultimately borne by consumers rather than the state. If prices stay high, it would mean higher bills for households in future. However, it could help smooth the transition, rather than having cliff-edge moments each time the Ofgem price cap is updated.",

        "text": "In this article CTRN\n\nCitigroup said it had identified the cause of the flash crash and corrected the error \"within minutes.\" Jim Dyson | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nLONDON \u2014 U.K. inflation is on course to exceed 18% in January as the country's energy price cap enters the stratosphere, Citi economists are projecting. In a research note dated Sunday, the U.S. banking giant updated its forecasts for the consumer price index and retail price index to 18% and 21%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2023. This is based on the assumption of a \u00a3300 policy offset applied to household energy bills from October through to 2024. Energy regulator Ofgem will this week announce the scale of the next price cap increase from Oct. 1, and Citi expects a rise to \u00a33,717 per year ($4,389) from the current \u00a31,971 for an average household. The price cap essentially limits the amount a supplier can charge for their tariffs, but this limit has surged higher recently due to the rise in wholesale prices \u2014 meaning Brits have seen bills skyrocket. Market research firm Cornwall Insight recently predicted that the cap would rise to \u00a34,266 in January, while consultancy firm Auxilione forecast last week that it would exceed \u00a36,000 by the spring. Benjamin Nabarro, senior associate in the global strategy and macro group at Citi, said guidance on future increases would be the most notable aspect of this week's announcement.\n\n\"We expect further increases to \u00a34,567 in January and then \u00a35,816 in April. The risks here remain skewed to the upside,\" Nabarro said. The key question now is how government policy might impact both inflation and the real economy after a new prime minister takes office on Sept. 5. Comments so far from Conservative leadership favorite Liz Truss point to only a \"limited offset\" for headline inflation, he suggested. \"We already account for a \u00a3300 reduction in bills associated with the suspension of the Green Levy and a cut to VAT on household energy bills,\" Nabarro said. \"However, in reality any government response to this is likely to involve substantially more fiscal firepower (around \u00a340bn in our view). Offsetting the energy increase in full would cost around \u00a330bn for the coming six months (1.4% GDP).\"\n\nThe issue for inflation, he added, is that any fiscal space deployed is likely to be squeezed between weaker medium-term forecasts and the new government's desire to cut taxes, meaning disinflationary measures are \"likely somewhat further down the pecking order.\" The Bank of England earlier this month hiked interest rates by 50 basis points, its largest single increase since 1995, and projected the U.K.'s longest recession since the global financial crisis. It also forecast that inflation would peak at 13.3% in October. Citi now expects a further 125 basis points of monetary tightening at the coming three meetings of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee. U.K. inflation hit 10.1% annually in July and is increasingly expected to exceed the MPC's latest projections.",

        "text": "That\u2019s because a less-intense version of the rent surge that is pushing inflation higher across cities in the American south is beginning to play out in bigger cities in the Northeast and on the West Coast. Real-time market rent trackers that reported prices shooting up in Sun Belt cities last year are now showing bigger increases in places like New York, San Jose and Seattle.\n\nInflation F.A.Q. Card 1 of 5 Inflation F.A.Q. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. Inflation F.A.Q. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Inflation F.A.Q. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. Inflation F.A.Q. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Inflation F.A.Q. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose market rent increases take time to trickle into official inflation figures because of the way the government calculates its data. Much as Phoenix\u2019s official inflation numbers are surging now partly because of the run-up in market rents in 2021, nascent increases in big coastal cities could keep pressure on inflation in months to come. And the effect could be palpable at a national level: New York and its suburbs account for about 11 percent of the nation\u2019s rental housing-related costs in the Consumer Price Index, compared to about 1 percent for Phoenix.\n\n\u201cEven if we get a slowdown in the Sun Belt, it may not be enough to offset what we\u2019re seeing in other markets,\u201d said Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights.\n\nFederal Reserve officials noted that risk at their July meeting, according to minutes released Wednesday, observing that \u201cin some product categories, the rate of price increase could well pick up further in the short run, with sizable additional increases in residential rental expenses being especially likely.\u201d\n\nThe Fed has been raising interest rates since March to try to slow consumer and business demand and cool inflation and is expected to lift them again at its meeting in September.\n\nTo date, much of the regional divide in price increases \u2014 from rents to consumer goods and services \u2014 has traced back to migration. People have been flocking to less expensive cities from big coastal ones for years, but that trend accelerated sharply with the onset of the pandemic. The pattern is playing out across both the Mountain West, where inflation is also remarkably high, and the Sun Belt.",

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a 0.1% increase in the top-line number and a flat total ex-autos. June's gain was revised down to 0.8% from 1%.\n\nRetail and food sales excluding gasoline and autos rose 0.7% from a month ago.\n\nThe numbers are adjusted seasonally but not for inflation, and come during a month when the consumer price index also was flat.\n\nA tumble in fuel prices off their record nominal highs pushed down sales at the pump, with gas station receipts off 1.8%. Motor vehicle and parts dealers sales also fell sharply, declining 1.6%.\n\nGas prices had eclipsed $5 a gallon in many locations earlier in the summer, but fell through July and most recently were at $3.94 a gallon for regular unleaded, according to AAA.\n\n\"People appear to have used some of the savings from lower gas prices to spend more on other items, both in nominal and \u2014 very likely \u2014 real terms,\" wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \"Auto sales have been severely constrained by the chip shortage, so pent-up demand likely is substantial.

        "text": "The UK economy is a puzzle. Inflation has burst above 10% for the first time since Argentina was gearing up to invade the Falklands in early 1982. Prices are rising far more quickly than wages. Consumer confidence has plumbed depths not seen during any of the many misfortunes of the past half century.\n\nAnd yet, the official data shows the British public is carrying on shopping regardless. Retail sales were higher in July than they were in June despite the progressively tighter squeeze on living standards. Airports are busy with holidaymakers, house prices keep on rising. Odd sort of crisis, you might think.\n\nOne possibility is that the gloom surrounding the economy has been overdone. Unemployment is low and job vacancies are high. People are not fearful of losing their jobs and if they are laid off they can hope to find another one relatively quickly.\n\nDemand for foreign holidays is strong because many households built up savings during the pandemic when spending opportunities were restricted. Those cash buffers are now being drawn down, bridging the cost of living gap left by rising inflation.\n\nYes, the Bank of England has raised interest rates at the last six meetings of its monetary policy committee, but in real terms \u2013 adjusted for inflation \u2013 borrowing costs are still low. Put together all these factors and there is a case for saying the UK will experience a relatively mild downturn this winter.\n\nEven the dire state of consumer confidence can be explained away, because a breakdown of the latest snapshot of sentiment shows people are much gloomier about the state of the economy than they are about their personal finances. The wall-to-wall negative reports about a looming cost of living crisis has been registered but, so far at least, households think they are managing.\n\nIt is curious, to say the least, that confidence as measured by GfK is reported to be lower than it was during the three-day week of early 1974, the deep manufacturing recession of the early 1980s and the period in 2008 when it looked as if the banking system would collapse. That may reflect the ubiquitous nature of modern media, and particularly social media, rather than objective economic conditions.\n\nThat is the upbeat view. There is an alternative, with consumers in denial about the horrors to come and having a last splurge of spending before they tighten their belts during autumn\u2019s perfect storm.\n\nThe gloomy view of the economy goes something like this. Growth has pretty much ground to a standstill in the first six months of 2022, with output rising a bit in the first quarter and falling marginally in the second quarter. The labour market has reached a turning point: employment growth is stalling and the number of job vacancies is coming down.\n\nFor now, this is a relatively slow process and many businesses are able to pay more than they would like to attract and retain staff. For the moment, they feel they can pass on the cost of higher wages to their customers by raising prices. The pickup in retail sales growth will do little to discourage them from doing so. This will feed through into core inflation \u2013 the cost of living excluding food, fuel, alcohol and tobacco \u2013 which is closely watched by the Bank of England and which rose above 6% last month.\n\nA double-digit inflation rate and signs that consumer demand is holding up make it more likely the Bank will raise rates by 0.5 percentage points next month, after a similar increase in August.\n\nThis will add to the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses just as higher domestic fuel prices bite. October\u2019s increase in the energy price cap will push up the annual inflation rate still further, intensifying the squeeze on real incomes and massively adding to the fixed costs for millions of businesses.\n\nThere has been plenty of attention paid to what the successor to Boris Johnson will do to alleviate the pain about to be inflicted on households, but less focus on what they ought to be doing to help businesses. In the short term, restaurants, hotels and high street shops will try to pass on their higher costs but they will be less able to do so as consumer demand weakens in the autumn than they have been in the summer. Many will throw in the towel.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\n\n\nIndustrial unrest will provide another dimension. Figures from the Office for National Statistics last week showed total annual pay growth in the private sector running at 5.9% and 1.8% for the public sector.\n\nWith inflation running at 10.1%, that represents a cut in living standards of more than 4% in the private sector and more than 8% in the much more heavily unionised public sector. Inevitably, there will be more strikes as workers \u2013 who can justifiably say they are not responsible for the cost of living crisis \u2013 seek to prevent themselves from getting even poorer.\n\nThe Bank of England leans towards the gloomier of these two scenarios, which is why it is forecasting a protracted recession for the UK in which unemployment rises by more than a million. Threadneedle Street thinks the good news (such as strong retail sales) is unlikely to persist, and that looks like a reasonable call.\n\nWhile that won\u2019t stop the Bank from continuing to raise interest rates in the short-term, by this time next year the monetary policy committee will be under pressure to cut them. The economy might appear to be strong. The labour market might seem to be defying gravity. But it is really just a mirage. Consumers are right to be downbeat even if they don\u2019t yet quite appreciate what is coming.",

        "text": "Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and chief executive officer of FTX Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange, speaks during an interview on an episode of Bloomberg Wealth with David Rubenstein in New York, US, on Wednesday, Aug 17, 2022.\n\nFTX rode the crypto craze to a billion dollars in revenue last year while expanding its global footprint through a flurry of acquisitions, according to internal documents seen by CNBC.\n\nThe audited financials give a rare glimpse into the privately held company's finances. FTX was profitable, quickly expanding across the globe and saw breakneck growth.\n\nThe crypto exchange's revenue soared more than 1,000% from $89 million to $1.02 billion in 2021. Its profitability, like many start-ups, depends on how you measure it. Operating income was $272 million, up from $14 million a year earlier. FTX saw net income of $388 million last year, up from just $17 million a year earlier.\n\nFTX declined to comment on the leaked financial documents.\n\nThe company brought in $270 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2022, and was on track to do roughly $1.1 billion in revenue in 2022, according to an investor deck shared with CNBC. But it's unclear how FTX held up in the second quarter as crypto prices plunged during the recent so-called \"Crypto Winter.\"\n\nBy way of comparison, publicly traded Coinbase also experienced a cash boom during crypto's bull market, with $7.4 billion in revenue and $3.6 billion of net income last year. But in the second quarter of this year, it reported $808.3 million in revenue, a decline of 64% from the year-ago quarter, and a surprise net loss of $1.1 billion, compared with $1.59 billion in net income a year earlier, as retail trading volumes cratered.\n\nFTX was founded three years ago by former Wall Street quant trader Sam Bankman-Fried. The 30-year-old CEO has recently stepped in as the industry's lender of last resort, looking to backstop companies as liquidity dried up. On top of multiple loans of hundreds of millions of dollars, Bankman-Fried's companies also looked to acquire distressed assets. In July, FTX signed a deal that gives it the option to buy lender BlockFi and was in discussions to acquire South Korean Bithumb. FTX also offered to buy Voyager in August but was turned down for what the company claimed was a \"low ball bid.\"\n\nFTX had roughly $2.5 billion in cash at the end of last year and 27% profit margins, according to the documents. Margins were closer to 50% if advertising and \"related party\" expenses are stripped out. It last raised money in January, collecting $400 million from investors like SoftBank's Vision Fund 2 and Tiger Global, at a $32 billion valuation.",

But relations between the United States and China have markedly deteriorated since then, on the heels of visits by two delegations of U.S. lawmakers to Taiwan this month, including by Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThe trips angered the Chinese government, which sees the island as an incontestable part of its territory, and it has responded by ramping up military drills and firing missiles into the waters around Taiwan. The United States, in turn, has accused China of using the visits as a pretext to step up operations to intimidate Taiwan, and has vowed to maintain its own military operations in the region.",

Kent Nishimura | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Reserve's path to bringing down runaway inflation while keeping the economy from slipping into a major downturn is still open but is getting narrower, according to Goldman Sachs. As the central bank looks to keep raising interest rates, the economy is teeming with mixed signals: rapidly rising payroll figures against sharply declining housing numbers, falling gasoline prices vs. surging shelter and food costs, and low consumer sentiment against steady spending numbers. Amid it all, the Fed is trying to strike a balance between slowing things down, but not by too much. On that score, Goldman economists think there have been clear wins, some losses and a landscape ahead that poses substantial challenges. \"Our broad conclusion is that there is a feasible but difficult path to a soft landing, though several factors beyond the Fed's control can ease or complicate that path and raise or lower the odds of success,\" Goldman economist David Mericle said in a client note Sunday.\n\nSlow growth, high inflation\n\nOne of the biggest inflation drivers has been outsized growth that has created imbalances between supply and demand. The Fed is using interest rate increases to try to damp down demand so supply can catch up, and supply chain pressures, as measured by a New York Fed index, are at their lowest since January 2021. So on that score, Mericle said the Fed's efforts have \"gone well.\" He said the rate increases \u2014 totaling 2.25 percentage points since March \u2014 have \"achieved a much-need deceleration\" regarding growth and specifically demand. In fact, Goldman expects GDP to grow at just a 1% pace over the next four quarters, and that's coming off consecutive declines of 1.6% and 0.9%. Though most economists expect that the National Bureau of Economic Research will not declare the U.S. in recession for the first half of the year, the slow-growth path makes the Fed's balancing act more difficult. On a similar count, Mericle said the Fed's moves have helped narrow the supply-demand gap in the labor market, where there are still nearly two job openings for every available worker. That effort \"has a long way to go,\" he wrote. However, the biggest problem remains stubbornly high inflation. The consumer price index was flat in July but still rose 8.5% from a year ago. Wages are surging at a strong clip, with average hourly earnings up 5.2% from a year ago. Consequently, the Fed's efforts to halt a spiral in which higher prices feed higher wages and perpetuate inflation have \"shown little convincing progress so far,\" Mericle said. \"The bad news is that high inflation is broad-based, measures of the underlying trend are elevated, and business inflation expectations and pricing intentions remain high,\" he added.\n\nDoubts about the Fed's policy path\n\nFighting inflation might require higher rate hikes than the market currently anticipates. Goldman's projection is that the Fed raises benchmark rates by another percentage point before the end of the year, but Mericle acknowledged that there is \"upside risk\" due to \"the recent easing in financial conditions, the robust pace of hiring, and signs of stickiness in wage growth and inflation.\" Indeed, former New York Fed President William Dudley said Monday he thinks the market is underestimating the future path of rate hikes and, consequently, the risks of a hard landing or recession.\n\n\"The market is misunderstanding what the Fed is up to,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in a live interview. \"I think the Fed is going to be higher for longer than what market participants understand at this point.\" In Dudley's view, the Fed will keep hiking until it is sure inflation is heading back to the central bank's 2% target. Even by the most generous inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price index that the Fed follows, inflation is still running at 4.8%. \"The labor market is much tighter than the Fed wants. The wage inflation rate is too high, not consistent with 2% inflation,\" he added. Dudley expects the rates to keep going up until the employment dynamic has shifted enough to get the unemployment rate \"well above 4%,\" compared to its current level of 3.5%.",

Should Conservatives be concerned that the rightward lurch of their party threatens its appeal at the next election to both new and traditional supporters?\n\nYounger, more educated voters have been moving out of London in their droves to the capital\u2019s commuter belt for some time, tilting the demographic makeup of numerous seats. Many marginal constituencies in the south-east \u2013 places such as Esher and Walton and Winchester \u2013 are home to large numbers of graduates and professionals, groups that once upon a time were reliable Conservative voters. The party can no longer take these voters for granted, especially those of working age. Not only are they more likely to be Remainers but they also tend to hold more socially liberal attitudes on issues such as immigration and the environment, and are less likely to be sympathetic to anti-woke, anti-green posturing.\n\nThe Conservatives hold 21 seats across the south (including London) with majorities smaller than 10,000 that also voted remain. In 11 of these, Labour is the main challenger, while the Liberal Democrats are the second party in 10 others. Many of these seats could come under threat if the new PM does not tack back towards the centre ground after the leadership contest is over.\n\nAt the same time, Truss\u2019s focus on tax cuts, and her reluctance to commit to help people with rising fuel bills in winter, threaten an important part of the party\u2019s electoral coalition. First-time Conservative voters in former industrial towns in the Midlands and north of England tend to hold more leftwing attitudes on public spending and redistribution than their counterparts in the south. As the country\u2019s economic position worsens in the autumn, many of these voters will be looking for the government to intervene. Tax cuts will be low on the agenda for most voters, and if expectations about tackling regional inequalities end in disappointment, there is a risk that many of the people who lent their vote to the Tories in 2019 will return to Labour at the next election. This could put many of the 45 \u201cred wall\u201d seats lost to the Conservatives back in play.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the leadership contest, the Conservative party seems set to double down on its culture-war agenda while pushing rightwards on the economy.\n\nIf the new PM persists with this course, especially in the context of a serious economic crisis, the party is in deep danger of losing seats both in its southern heartlands and in the red wall at the next election.\n\nWill Jennings is professor of political science and public policy at the University of Southampton",

        "text": "Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and chief executive officer of FTX Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange, speaks during an interview on an episode of Bloomberg Wealth with David Rubenstein in New York, US, on Wednesday, Aug 17, 2022.\n\nFTX, the crypto exchange controlled by Sam Bankman-Fried, received a cease-and-desist warning on Friday from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, telling the company to stop \"misleading\" consumers about the insurance status of their funds.\n\nThe FDIC issued letters to five crypto companies, including FTX US. Unlike deposits held at U.S. banks, cryptocurrencies stored with brokerages are not protected by the government.\n\n\"Based upon evidence collected by the FDIC, each of these companies made false representations \u2014including on their websites and social media accounts \u2014 stating or suggesting that certain crypto-related products are FDIC-insured or that stocks held in brokerage accounts are FDIC-insured,\" the regulator said in a press release.\n\nIn addition to FTX US, the FDIC notified Cryptonews.com, Cryptosec.info, SmartAsset.com and FDICCrypto.com. The FDIC said the companies must \"take immediate corrective action to address these false or misleading statements.\" The agency said knowingly misrepresenting or implying that an uninsured product is FDIC-insured is prohibited by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.\n\nIn the letter specifically to FTX, the FDIC said it appeared that on July 20, Brett Harrison, the president of FTX.US, published a tweet stating that direct deposits from employers are stored in FDIC-insured accounts in the user's name.\n\nHarrison tweeted on Friday that he deleted that post and didn't mean to indicate that crypto assets stored in FTX are insured by the FDIC, but rather \"USD deposits from employers were held at insured banks.\"\n\n\"We really didn't mean to mislead anyone, and we didn't suggest that FTX US itself, or that crypto/non-fiat assets, benefit from FDIC insurance,\" Harrison wrote.\n\nFTX.US is a U.S. cryptocurrency exchange owned by FTX, which is based in the Bahamas and has been largely focused on building its business outside of the U.S.\n\nThe FDIC also said that the websites for SmartAsset and CryptoSec identify FTX as an \"'FDIC-insured' cryptocurrency exchange.\"\n\nWATCH: Sam Bankfman-Fried's portfolio",

After she bought the tea, she headed to Aldi, a cheaper supermarket, to shop for her family.\n\nIn the past months, as food prices have soared in Britain, she has cut down on meat and relied on pasta and sauces instead. Her children have stopped attending swimming lessons, she has limited their trips to the fridge for snacks and she has turned down their requests for money to spend at the bowling alley.",

After all, the monthly import price drop of 1.4% was just the first this year, and the year-over-year increase is still more than 8.8%.\n\nThat news followed reports earlier in the week that both wholesale and retail price increases abated for the month. Producer prices declined 0.5%, and consumer prices including food and fuel were flat, both numbers owing largely to a sharp slide in most of the energy complex.\n\nPeople are noticing: A New York Federal Reserve survey released Monday showed consumers are expecting inflation to stay high but not by as much as previous months. On Friday, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey \u2014 whose ups and downs tend to ride in tandem with prices at the pump \u2014 was higher than expected, though still just off record-low levels hit in June.",

        "text": "Whenever I told him things were going from bad to worse, my father used to nod sagely and say: \u201cIt was ever thus.\u201d However, I wonder what he would have said now about the state of the country and the \u201cgoverning\u201d Conservative party.\n\nIn a leadership race whose inanity almost beggars belief, the two very rightwing contenders seem obsessed with establishing their Thatcherite credentials without, as far as I can see, having a clue what Thatcherism was really about.\n\nTake this obsession with cutting personal rates of income tax. When Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979, the top rate of income tax was 83%. In his first budget Sir Geoffrey Howe reduced it to 60%, and the basic rate from 33% to 30%. They decided it would look bad to lower the top rate alone, even though it was absurdly high. But to balance the books they were forced to raise VAT. They had committed themselves not to double VAT \u2013 in those days campaign commitments were serious \u2013 so they raised it from 8% to 15%.\n\nIn his budget of 1988, my old friend Nigel Lawson brought the top rate down to 40% and the basic to 25%. These days the basic rate is 20% and the higher rate remains at Lawson\u2019s level, except for the additional rate on incomes above \u00a3150,000, which is 45%. This history puts into context the absurdity of Truss\u2019s and Sunak\u2019s obsession with cutting present tax rates \u2013 she now, he later \u2013 when the nation\u2019s infrastructure and public services have become an embarrassment. Current rates of taxation are miles, and years, away from the situation that faced the Thatcher government of 1979, and low by international standards.\n\nOh and by the way: do these fanatics really want to emulate the Thatcher government\u2019s \u201cachievements\u201d of presiding over a doubling of the inflation rate, to approaching 20%, between 1979 and 1980 \u2013 accompanied by the biggest recession since the second world war \u2013 and a level of unemployment that rose from under 1.5 million in 1979 (when Conservative posters proclaimed \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d) to more than 3 million by 1986? Do they not realise, as they chase chimerical Brexit \u201copportunities\u201d, that Kenneth Clarke, a decent Tory, described her contribution to forming the European single market as Thatcher\u2019s greatest achievement?\n\nSign up to The Best of Guardian Opinion Free daily newsletter Get out of your bubble.

When they said they were one nation Tories they meant it. Any concessions Truss makes to the poor have to be wrung out of her as she goes on propounding tax cuts for people who don\u2019t need them; and I fear Sunak, after the credit he earned for helping those in hardship during the pandemic, was found out recently: yes, he was caught boasting that he had been, in effect, \u201clevelling down\u201d by reallocating Treasury funds from poorer to richer areas.\n\nBritain is suffering now from the progressive assault on public sector provision started by Thatcher and resumed with the Osborne austerity programme of 2010 onwards, on which has now been superimposed the biggest economic crisis of many people\u2019s lifetimes \u2013 and the Brexit disaster on top.\n\nThat great one nation Tory Harold Macmillan is often credited with having told the British electorate in 1957 that \u201cYou\u2019ve never had it so good\u201d. Well, he never actually said it. What he said was: \u201cLet\u2019s be frank about it: most [my italics] of our people have never had it so good.\u201d He went on: \u201cThe Conservative party is not the party of any class or section \u2026 and we cannot forget that some sections of our people have not shared in this general prosperity \u2026 we cannot, as a national party, see their interests sacrificed.\u201d\n\nWith the present cost of living crisis, impelled by the addition of externally induced cost increases on a badly battered supply side, a modern Macmillan would be tempted to say: \u201cLet\u2019s be frank about it: most of our people have never had it so bad.\u201d\n\nIn the face of this, neither of the contenders appears to have a solution. Moreover, they are not prepared to admit that the Brexit they promoted (in Sunak\u2019s case) or accepted (in Truss\u2019s case) is a disaster, severely damaging the investment they purport to champion, with ripple effects on output and, yes, taxable capacity. If either had any serious leadership qualities, they should be admitting their mistakes and conceding that we should be back in the single market championed by their putative heroine \u2013 er, one Margaret Thatcher.",

        "text": "In this article OXY\n\nBRK.A\n\nWarren Buffett at press conference during the Berkshire Hathaway Shareholders Meeting, April 30, 2022. CNBC\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway on Friday received regulatory approval to purchase up to 50% of oil giant Occidental Petroleum. Shares of Occidental jumped 10% on the news to close at $71.29 apiece, pushing their 2022 gains to more than 145%. On July 11, Berkshire filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to buy more of the oil company's common stock in secondary market transactions. The conglomerate argued that a maximum 50% stake wouldn't hurt competition or diminish regulatory authority. Carlos Clay, acting director of division of electric power regulation, granted the permission Friday, saying authorization was \"consistent with the public interest.\" The conglomerate has already increased its Occidental stake drastically this year. Berkshire currently owns 188.5 million shares of Occidental, equal to a 20.2% position. It surpassed a key threshold where Berkshire could record some of the oil company's earnings with its own, potentially adding billions of dollars in profit.\n\nBerkshire also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock, and has warrants to buy another 83.9 million common shares for $5 billion, or $59.62 each. The warrants were obtained as part of the company's 2019 deal that helped finance Occidental's purchase of Anadarko. The stake would rise to nearly 27% if Berkshire exercises those warrants. Acquiring the whole company? Friday's news fueled speculation that Buffett will be interested in acquiring the whole company eventually after ramping up his stake at low prices. \"He will likely continue to buy as much as he can get below $70 or $75. If you own 30% or 40% and would like to buy it out at $95 or $100, you saved a lot of money,\" said Cole Smead, president of Smead Capital Management and a Berkshire shareholder. \"This stock trades like a casino. The market is giving him all the stock he wants.\" David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business, said an acquisition down the road is likely.",

        "text": "Wholesale prices fell in July for the first time in two years as a plunge in energy prices slowed the pace of inflation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday.\n\nThe producer price index, which gauges the prices received for final demand products, fell 0.5% from June, the first month-over-month decrease since April 2020, the month after Covid-19 was declared a pandemic. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting an increase of 0.2%.\n\nOn an annual basis, the index rose 9.8%, the lowest rate since October 2021. That compares with an 11.3% increase in June and the record 11.7% gain in March.\n\nMost of the decline came from energy, which dropped 9% at the wholesale level and accounted for 80% of the total decline in goods prices, which fell 1.8%. The index for services rose 0.1%.\n\nStripping out food, energy and trade services, PPI increased 0.2% in July, which was less than the expected 0.4% gain. Core PPI rose 5.8% from a year ago.\n\nThe numbers come a day after the consumer price index showed that inflation was flat in July though up 8.5% from a year ago. The easing in the CPI also reflected the slide in energy prices that has seen prices at the pump fall below $4 a gallon after hitting record nominal levels above $5 earlier in the summer.",

Its recovery from the pandemic recession has been stunted, in part, by breakdowns in support for some of the workers who should be powering those industries\u2019 revival. The cost and availability of child care alone is keeping many potential workers sidelined, leading to an abundance of unfilled job openings and costing business owners money.\n\nYet Mr. Biden has so far been unable to deliver on many of the programs he proposed to help Americans balance work responsibilities with care for children or aging parents, and to pursue high-quality education from a young age. He could not secure universal prekindergarten or free community college tuition. He could not find support to fund child care subsidies or to extend a tax credit meant to fight child poverty. And his plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to expand and improve home health services for seniors and disabled people have also foundered.\n\nThose omissions add up to what liberal economists call a missed opportunity to help Americans work more and earn more, and to make the economy run more efficiently.\n\nMr. Biden has had more success in getting Democrats, and some Republicans, to invest in the physical economy and to embrace a more interventionist view of federal power, said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the liberal Groundwork Collaborative in Washington. By embracing industrial policy and government-induced emissions reduction, she said, \u201cHe\u2019s moved to an economic system and an economic agenda where the government is really throwing its weight around, putting its thumb on the scale,\u201d she said.\n\nBut, she added, \u201cwe didn\u2019t get the care agenda. That\u2019s a huge miss. Until we get affordable child care, our economy\u2019s not going to be at full strength.\u201d",

        "text": "A shopping cart is seen in a supermarket as inflation affected consumer prices in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., June 10, 2022. Andrew Kelly | Reuters\n\nIf inflation has been the biggest threat to U.S. economic growth, then July's data should provide signs that there's at least some relief in the pipeline. Prices were flat for the month as gauged by the items that the Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks for its consumer price index. That marked the first time the aggregate measure hadn't posted a month-over-month increase since May 2020, when the widely followed index showed a modest decline. Just a month ago, CPI posted its fastest 12-month gain since November 1982, following a trend that helped send economic growth into contraction for the first half of the year, stirring up talk of a recession. But with at least the short-term trend indicating the rate of price increases is abating, economic optimism is perking up.\n\nNo recession, for now\n\n\"The whole recession narrative really needs to be put on a shelf for now,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies. \"I think it's going to be shifting to a stronger-for-longer narrative, which is really supported by a reversal in inflation.\" Markowska, whose forecasts this year have been accurate, sees solid growth in the near term, including a 3% growth rate in the third quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow gauge, which tracks economic data in real time, pointed to a 2.5% growth rate in a Wednesday update, up 1.1 percentage points from its last one on Aug. 4. However, Markowska also expects pressures to intensify in 2023, with a recession likely in the back part of the year. Indeed, there was a little bit for both arguments in the CPI report. Most of the tempering in inflation came because of a fall in energy prices. Gasoline slid 7.7%, the biggest monthly decline since April 2020. Fuel oil tumbled 11% as energy-related commodity prices were off 7.6%.\n\nTransportation services cost increases also came off the boil, with airline fares tumbling 7.8% to reverse a trend that has seen tickets surge 27.7% over the past year. But there were few other signs of inflation declines in the report, with food costs particularly high. The food index, in fact, rose 1.1% on the month, and its 10.9% pace over the past 12 months is the highest since May 1979. That's causing worries at places such as City Harvest, which helps feed needy New Yorkers who have been hit especially hard by price surge that began last year. \"We're seeing many more children come into food pantries,\" said Jilly Stephens, the organization's CEO. \"Food insecurity had been intractable even before the pandemic hit. Now we're seeing even more people turn to food pantries because of the rising prices.\" Stephens said the number of children seeking food assistance about doubled a year after the Covid pandemic hit, and the organization is struggling to keep up. \"We're always optimistic, because we are supported by incredibly generous New Yorkers,\" she said.\n\nPeople keep spending\n\nDespite the surging prices, consumers have been resilient, continuing to spend even with inflation-adjusted wages contracting 3% over the past year. Jonathan Silver, CEO of Affinity Solutions, which tracks consumer behavior through credit and debit card transactions, said spending is at a healthy pace, rising about 10.5% over the past year, though inflation is influencing behavior. \"When you start to look at specific categories, there's been a lot of shifting in spending, and as a result, some categories are being impacted more than others by inflation,\" he said. \"People are delaying their spending on discretionary items.\" For instance, he said department store spending has fallen 2.4% over the past year, while discount store spending has risen 17%. Amusement park spending is down 18%, but movie theaters are up 92%. Some of those numbers are influenced by rising prices, but they generally reflect the level of transactions as well. As inflation eases, Silver expects discretionary spending to increase. \"We believe there will be a spike later in the year that will create an upward slope to the spending in key categories where the consumer has been delaying and deferring spending,\" he said. \"Consumers may get a holiday present of some relief on food prices.\"",

        "text": "On his tour of the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen last week, Li Keqiang, the premier, tried to send some positive energy at a time many citizens have been complaining of economic hardship.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s opening will continue. The Yellow river and the Yangtze river will not flow backward,\u201d Li said, striking an upbeat tone while visiting Yantian Port, a gateway to Europe and North America, two of China\u2019s biggest markets.\n\n\u201cThe waters of Yantian Port will also flow incessantly, and not only will continue to maintain your advantages, but also expand your advantages,\u201d Li added. Yet last year, the traffic was far from incessant: Covid rules shut the port, delaying deliveries over Christmas. This spring, similar restrictions forced vessels to queue to enter.\n\nSince the start of this year, China\u2019s insistence on a zero-Covid policy has caused much inconvenience and uncertainty for its people and the struggling economy, prompting grave concerns inside the country about what comes next.\n\n\u201cThe property sector is ailing, investments are all falling, and people are saving rather than spending,\u201d says Hong Hao, a prominent market analyst whose social media account was censored this year after downbeat remarks about the economic outlook.\n\nHong highlights three big headaches for Beijing policymakers: Covid, property and troubling relations with major western countries. \u201cBut there are obstacles all over the place really, and it\u2019s hard to discern which one is the biggest.\u201d\n\nThese stumbling blocks will almost certainly lead to China missing its own economic growth target of \u201caround 5.5%\u201d this year, which Li set in March. In another worrying development, the July unemployment rate among 16- to 24-year-olds reached a record 19.9%, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nSo much so, a recent politburo meeting chaired by the president, Xi Jinping, omitted any mention of a GDP goal, instead suggesting the country should \u201cstabilise employment and prices, maintain economic operations within a reasonable range, and strive to achieve the best possible results\u201d.\n\nThe worries expressed inside China are palpable, though there is also consensus that if its growth model does not reform, the economy will soon run out of the steam. But any change \u2013 for example through Beijing\u2019s tough policies for the property sector announced in 2020 \u2013 would result in major disruption, at least in the short-to-near term. In other words, Beijing is facing a real policy dilemma.\n\n\u201cThe two fundamental problems for China are a natural growth slowdown and improving its regulatory environment,\u201d says Nancy Qian, an economics professor at Northwestern University in Chicago. \u201cBoth are standard growing pains as the economy grows from a low-income to a higher-middle-income one.\u201d\n\nQian says China\u2019s growth is slowing and will plateau because it has reached limits set by its fundamentals. \u201cOne cannot reduce unemployment without creating new jobs. But how can there be new jobs if existing firms don\u2019t make more money? And many firms, like the real-estate firms and construction industry in trouble today, have been doing much worse than we thought.\u201d\n\nThe bad economic performance may be unavoidable, but it has real social \u2013 and potentially political \u2013 consequences. This is particularly the case for a system without the safety valve of elections.\n\nLast month, it emerged that hundreds of homebuyers across the country were huddling together to refuse payments on mortgages on homes left unfinished by developers. On social media, angry buyers discussed ways to attract the government\u2019s attention in order to put pressure on \u201cgreedy and dishonest developers\u201d.\n\nSensing a social crisis in the making, Beijing quickly came up with measures to smooth out the tensions and aid the property sector \u2013 which accounts for 25% of the Chinese economy. Some local officials produced novel ideas, such as encouraging party members to lead the buying spree.\n\n\u201cI hope that today all comrades will take the lead in buying property,\u201d Deng Bibo, a county party secretary in Hunan province, urged in a viral video this week. \u201cBuy one property, then buy a second one. If you purchased a second one already, then buy a third. Bought a third? Then buy your fourth.\u201d\n\nDeng Bibo, a county party secretary of China\u2019s Hunan province, encouraged everyone to buy several homes during his opening speech for a real estate exhibition fair in Shimen, a county of Hunan.\n\nQian says the real-estate crisis is one example of the difficulty of maturing the regulatory system for a rapidly growing economy. Chinese watchdogs and policymakers have known for a while that huge property firms such as Evergrande were borrowing a lot. It worked as long as the economy was growing. But at some point the music stops.\n\nNow China is stuck in a vicious circle. \u201cThe faster the slowdown, the bigger the problem,\u201d says Qian. \u201cThe less trust consumers have in the economy, the less willing they are to keep paying for incomplete housing, and the bigger the problem. The faster the slowdown, the less trust consumers have.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s domestic trouble also has an international dimension. What was once \u201cthe world\u2019s factory\u201d is now entangled in geopolitical battles with many western markets. Last month, Tony Danker, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said UK companies were already rethinking their operations in anticipation of the UK\u2019s decoupling with China.\n\nBut, perhaps the biggest elephant in the room in China\u2019s economy today is politics, analysts say. In one of Li\u2019s videos during his Shenzhen tour, he was heard likening reforming and opening China to \u201cblazing a trail of blood\u201d. But soon after it was uploaded to Chinese social media, users began to report they were no longer able to view it.\n\n\u201cAfter users\u2019 complaints and following the platform\u2019s examination, this video touched on political and current affairs content that was not qualified to publish,\u201d the error message read.",

        "text": "Check out the companies making headlines before the bell:\n\nDeere (DE) \u2013 Deere slid 5.2% in premarket trading after the heavy equipment maker missed quarterly earnings estimates despite higher-than-expected sales. Deere earned $6.16 per share, below the consensus estimate of $6.69, as it successfully implemented price hikes but also faced higher costs. The company also cut its full-year forecast.\n\nFoot Locker (FL) \u2013 Foot Locker surged 17.4% in the premarket after the athletic footwear and apparel retailer's quarterly earnings beat analyst forecasts, and the company also announced a CEO transition.

        "text": "Pandemic fraud became such an open secret that it ceased to be much of a secret at all. In September 2020, a California rapper named Fontrell Antonio Baines, who performs as Nuke Bizzle, posted a music video on YouTube, bragging in detail about how he had gotten rich by submitting false unemployment claims. His song was called \u201cEDD,\u201d after California\u2019s Employment Development Department, which paid the benefits.\n\n\u201cI just seen 30 cards land in one day. Got straight on the phone and activate,\u201d Mr. Baines rapped in the song, flashing cash and envelopes with preloaded debit cards from the state.\n\n\u201cUnemployment so sweet,\u201d he said.\n\nAll three of those programs are now over. There is no official estimate for the amount of money that was stolen from them \u2014 or from pandemic-relief programs in general. The Justice Department has charged people with about $1 billion in fraud so far, and is investigating other cases involving $6 billion more, investigators said.\n\nBut other reports have suggested the real number could be much higher. One official said the total of \u201cimproper\u201d unemployment payments could be more than $163 billion, as first reported by The Washington Post. In the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, a watchdog found that $58 billion had been paid to companies that shared the same addresses, phone numbers, bank accounts or other data as other applicants \u2014 a sign of potential fraud.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear there\u2019s tens of billions in fraud,\u201d said Michael Horowitz, the chairman of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, which includes 21 agency inspectors general working on fraud cases. \u201cWould it surprise me if it exceeded $100 billion? No.\u201d\n\nThe effort to catch fraudsters began as soon as the money started flowing, and the first person was charged with benefit fraud in May 2020. But investigators were quickly deluged with tips at a scale they had never dealt with before. The Small Business Administration\u2019s fraud hotline \u2014 which had previously received 800 calls a year \u2014 got 148,000 in the first year of the pandemic. The Small Business Administration sent its inspector general two million loan applications to check for potential identity theft. At the Labor Department, the inspector general\u2019s office has 39,000 cases of suspected unemployment fraud, a 1,000 percent increase from prepandemic levels.",

        "text": "Prices that consumers pay for a variety of goods and services rose 8.5% in July from a year ago, a slowing pace from the previous month due largely to a drop in gasoline prices. On a monthly basis, the consumer price index was flat as energy prices broadly declined 4.6% and gasoline fell 7.7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That offset a 1.1% monthly gain in food prices and a 0.5% increase in shelter costs. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting headline CPI to increase 8.7% on an annual basis and 0.2% monthly.\n\nExcluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core CPI rose 5.9% annually and 0.3% monthly, compared with respective estimates of 6.1% and 0.5%.\n\nEven with the lower-than-expected numbers, inflation pressures remained strong. The jump in the food index put the 12-month increase to 10.9%, the fastest pace since May 1979. Butter is up 26.4% over the past year, eggs have surged 38% and coffee is up more than 20%. Despite the monthly drop in the energy index, electricity prices rose 1.6% and were up 15.2% from a year ago. The energy index rose 32.9% from a year ago. Used vehicle prices posted a 0.4% monthly decline, while apparel prices also fell, easing 0.1%, and transportation services were off 0.5% as airline fares fell 1.8% for the month and 7.8% from a year ago. Markets reacted positively to the report, with futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 400 points and government bond yields down sharply. \"Things are moving in the right direction,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies. \"This is the most encouraging report we've had in quite some time.\" The report was good news for workers, who saw a 0.5% monthly increase in real wages. Inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings were still down 3% from a year ago. Shelter costs, which make up about one-third of the CPI weighting, continued to rise and are up 5.7% over the past 12 months.",

        "text": "Almost six months after Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into Ukraine, the extent of the damage to the European economy is becoming clear. The red lights of recession are flashing.\n\nThe eurozone\u2019s big four economies \u2013 Germany, France, Italy and Spain \u2013 have all had their growth forecasts for 2023 downgraded by the International Monetary Fund, as a combination of the war and higher interest rates put a brake on activity.\n\nIn the UK, inflation is above 10% for the first time in 40 years as households struggle with rising energy bills. The Bank of England forecasts inflation will peak above 13% in autumn after a fresh increase in energy costs, while the economy will fall into a lengthy recession.\n\nWhile Britain is contending with additional pressures from Brexit, the impact of soaring energy prices, supply chain disruption, shortages of workers and drought are also hitting the rest of Europe. Analysts at the Economist Intelligence Unit say the pain could go on for some time, because countries must wean themselves off Russian hydrocarbons, and building up renewables as an alternative will take time.\n\n\u201cIn the near term we expect a recession in Europe in the winter of 2022-23 as a result of energy shortages and sustained elevated inflation\u201d, the EIU said. \u201cThe winter of 2023-24 will also be challenging, and so we expect high inflation and sluggish growth until at least 2024.\u201d\n\nHere we assess the chances of recession in the EU \u2013 and Russia.\n\nGermany\n\nEurope\u2019s largest economy is in the centre of the storm, as the energy crisis, months without rainfall, and a breakdown in global trade batter its manufacturing base. Economic growth slowed to stall speed in the second quarter and is likely to turn negative in the coming months.\n\n\u201cIt will need an economic miracle for Germany not to fall into recession in the second half of the year,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski of the Dutch bank ING. \u201cThe fact that the entire German economic business model is currently up for renovation will also weigh on growth prospects in the coming years.\u201d\n\nRussia supplied more than half of Germany\u2019s gas in 2020 and about a third of all oil. Since the outbreak of war, the Kremlin has throttled supplies, blaming technical problems for a fall in volume through the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline.\n\nDrought and scorching temperatures have caused a sharp fall in water levels on the Rhine, a key transport route for Germany\u2019s dominant industrial sector. Water levels have fallen below the critical 40cm mark, preventing barges from being loaded to full capacity. Some routes have been cancelled, causing delays for chemicals firms and other manufacturers in industrial heartlands. Factories along the shores of the Rhine dependent on water for cooling have also faced problems, while coal shipments to power plants \u2013 which had been earmarked for keeping the lights on \u2013 are likely to be disrupted.\n\nIn response to the energy crisis, Berlin will impose a gas levy for households, due to come into effect from October and lasting until April 2024, which is designed to spread the higher wholesale cost between households and industry.\n\nThe government has put in place an energy support package worth more than \u20ac30bn (\u00a326bn), including a \u20ac300 lump sum for workers, extra support for those on welfare, cuts to petrol and diesel taxes and discounted \u20ac9 bus and train tickets.\n\nThe German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has also promised a fresh package of financial support.\n\nChances of recession (out of five)\n\nFrance\n\nFrance should be better insulated than many other European nations, thanks to its large nuclear energy sector, which accounts for just over 70% of its electricity generation, but it has been struggling with serious faults at ageing reactors. Although in a less parlous position than Germany, the eurozone\u2019s second-biggest economy could still face damaging power cuts this winter.\n\nGDP rose in France by 0.5% in the second quarter, lower than in other nations across the continent, with domestic consumption notably weak. The government has put in place an emergency support package worth \u20ac20bn, including tax cuts at petrol pumps, while capping an increase in regulated electricity prices at 4%, a policy helped by state ownership of the energy giant EDF.\n\nChances of recession\n\nItaly\n\nThe Italian economy has performed much more strongly recently than its big eurozone rivals, notching up growth of 1% in the second quarter. But like Germany, Italy is heavily dependent on Russian gas and has the added complication of being thrown into a fresh bout of political uncertainty after the resignation of Mario Draghi as prime minister earlier this summer.\n\nOpinion polls point to a change of direction from Draghi\u2019s technocratic approach following forthcoming elections. A rightwing coalition government that has been campaigning on a strongly nationalistic and protectionist economic platform is expected to win.\n\nFinancial markets and the European Central Bank are already alive to the risks of investors demanding a higher interest-rate premium for buying Italian bonds. With Italy firmly in mind, the ECB announced a new financial instrument last month designed to prevent higher interest rates from having a disproportionately adverse impact on more vulnerable member states.\n\nIn early August, Italy approved a new aid package worth about \u20ac17bn for consumers and businesses, in one of Draghi\u2019s final acts as leader. A tax cut on petrol and diesel, which had been due to expire this month, has also been extended to 20 September.\n\nSince the creation of the single currency almost a quarter of a century ago, Italy has been the weakest performing of the \u201cbig four\u201d, with living standards barely higher than at the end of the 1990s. It is benefiting this year from a boost to tourism, which accounted for 13% of its GDP before the pandemic.\n\nChances of recession\n\nSpain\n\nLike every other country in Europe, Spain is affected by the war in Russia but of the big four it has the best chance of avoiding recession, despite soaring inflation.\n\nThere are a number of reasons for this. Its economy went into the crisis in reasonably good shape and \u2013 like Italy \u2013 has been given an added boost by the surge in tourism after the pandemic. Tourism accounted for 12% of Spain\u2019s GDP before Covid and an even bigger share of employment.\n\nBut Spain is much less reliant on Russian energy than Italy, and is already a big importer of liquefied natural gas from around the world. GDP rose by 1.1% in the second quarter and the IMF expects it to be the fastest growing of the big four next year.\n\nThe government has put in place \u20ac16bn of financial aid and loans to help companies and households with soaring energy costs.\n\nChances of recession\n\nRussia\n\nRussia has suffered under the west\u2019s sanctions, plunging its economy into a deep recession and forcing the Kremlin to default on its foreign debts for the first time since 1918, though soaring energy prices have helped blunt some of the impact.\n\nResearchers from Yale University said last month that the west was crippling the Russian economy, although other experts disagree. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank, said that recent data did not point to such a \u201cstark conclusion\u201d.\n\nA \u2018Stars\u2019 coffee bar in Moscow: Russia is already in recession. Photograph: Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRussia\u2019s current account balance \u2013 measuring trade and investment flows \u2013 more than tripled to hit a record $167bn surplus in the second quarter, helped by high wholesale oil and gas prices swelling exports, while western sanctions led to a fall in imports. The proceeds have been a vital source of hard currency for Moscow, reflected in the rouble erasing losses seen since the start of the invasion.\n\nHowever, over the long run experts say Russia\u2019s economy will struggle with the loss of western technology and investment. \u201cOur best guess is that Russia is in a major but still far from catastrophic recession\u201d, Schmieding added.",

        "text": "Check out the companies making the biggest moves midday:\n\nCisco Systems \u2014 Shares of the networking equipment producer jumped 5.8%. The company reported earnings after the bell on Wednesday that beat estimates. Cisco also provided a better-than-expected forecast for 2023.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond \u2014 The latest favored meme stock, which has surged in August, dropped almost 20%. Investors appeared to be reacting to activist investor Ryan Cohen's filing that he intends to sell his entire stake in the company.\n\nKohl's \u2014 Kohl's shares sank more than 7% after the retailer slashed its financial forecast for the year, citing inflation pressures on middle-income customers. The company expects net sales in fiscal 2022 down 5% to 6%, down from a prior range of flat to up 1%. However, Kohl's beat analysts' expectations for fiscal second-quarter profit and revenue.\n\nBJ's Wholesale \u2014 Shares of the club retailer popped more than 7% on Thursday after BJ's reported better-than-expected results for the second quarter. The company generated $1.06 in adjusted earnings per share on $5.01 billion of revenue. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting 80 cents per share on $4.67 billion of revenue. The company's comparable sales rose 7.6% year over year, excluding gasoline. BJ's was also upgraded by Bank of America to a buy from neutral.\n\nElanco Animal Health \u2014 Shares of Elanco shed more than 4% after the company was downgraded by Morgan Stanley. The firm shifted the stock to equal weight from overweight citing concerns about future profits.\n\nVerizon \u2014 Shares of Verizon slipped 2.54% after MoffettNathanson downgraded it to underperform and slashed its price target. Increased competition from AT&T and T-Mobile is weighing on Verizon and will likely drag shares lower, analysts said.\n\nCanadian Solar \u2014 The solar equipment and services company hit a new 52-week high, popping more than 15%, after reporting quarterly profits that beat expectations. Canadian Solar also raised its full-year revenue forecast and reported solar module shipments that were at the high end of its forecast.\n\nWolfspeed \u2014 Shares surged more than 31% after the semiconductor company surpassed expectations in its most recent earnings report. Wolfspeed CEO Gregg Lowe said he remains \"very encouraged about the industry's prospects for future growth and the activity we are seeing across our end-markets.\"\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance \u2014 Shares of Walgreens fell more than 5% in trading Thursday. The drugstore chain, along with CVS and Walmart, was ordered Wednesday by a federal judge to pay a combined $650.6 million to two Ohio counties to address damage done by the opioid crisis. Walgreens also announced Wednesday it had sold 11 million shares of Option Care Health's common stock in an underwritten secondary offering.\n\nEnergy stocks \u2014 Energy stocks were buoyed by the rise in oil prices, with shares of Devon Energy and Halliburton rising more than 5%, and APA adding more than 8%.

Lower-income and rural workers who have older, less fuel-efficient vehicles and drive longer distances to work are particularly hurt by high gasoline prices.",

Olga Maltseva | Afp | Getty Images\n\nFood prices dropped significantly in July from the previous month, particularly the costs of wheat and vegetable oil, according to the latest figures from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. But the FAO said that while the drop in food prices \"from very high levels\" is \"welcome,\" there are doubts over whether the good news will last. \"Many uncertainties remain, including high fertilizer prices that can impact future production prospects and farmers' livelihoods, a bleak global economic outlook, and currency movements, all of which pose serious strains for global food security,\" FAO chief economist Maximo Torero said in a press release. The FAO food price index, which tracks the monthly change in the global prices of a basket of food commodities, fell 8.6% in July from the month before. In June, the index fell just 2.3% month on month. However, the index in July was still 13.1% higher than July 2021.\n\nPrices in the short term may fall further, if futures are anything to go by. Wheat, soybean, sugar, and corn futures have fallen from their March highs back to prices seen at the start of 2022. For example, the wheat contracts closed at $775.75 per bushel on Friday, down from a 12-year high of $1,294 in March, and around the $758 price set in January.\n\nWhy prices fell\n\nAnalysts cited a mix of both demand and supply reasons for the slide in food prices: Ukraine and Russia's closely watched agreement to resume exports of grain through the Black Sea after months of blockade; better-than-expected crop harvests; a global economic slowdown; and the strong U.S. dollar. Rob Vos, the director of markets, trade and institutions at the International Food Policy Research Institute, pointed to the news that the United States and Australia are set to deliver bumper wheat harvests this year, which will improve supply since shipment from Ukraine and Russia have been curtailed. The higher U.S. dollar also lowers the price of staples, since commodities are priced in U.S. dollars, Vos said. Traders tend to ask for lower nominal dollar prices of commodities when the greenback is expensive.\n\nThe widely heralded U.N.-backed deal between Ukraine and Russia also helped to cool the market. Ukraine was the world's sixth-biggest wheat exporter in 2021, accounting for 10% of global wheat market share, according to the United Nations. The first shipment of Ukrainian grain \u2014 26,000 tons of maize \u2014 since the invasion left the country's southwestern port of Odesa last Monday.\n\nSkepticism over Ukraine-Russia deal\n\nGlobal skepticism over whether Russia will keep its end of the bargain hangs in the air. Russia fired a missile onto Odesa just hours after the U.N.-brokered deal in late-July. And freight and insurance companies may still think it's too risky to ship grain out of a war zone, Vos said, adding that food prices remain volatile and any new shock can cause more price surges. \"To make a difference it will not be enough to get a few shipments out, but at least 30 or 40 per month to get the existing grains stored in Ukraine out, as well as the produce of the upcoming harvest,\" said Vos. \"To help stabilize markets, the deal will need to hold in full also during the second half of the year since that is the period where Ukraine does most of its exports.\"\n\nEven with the existing agreement, arable Ukrainian land may continue to be destroyed \"for as long as the war continues,\" which will result in even less crop yield next year, Carlos Mera, the head of agri commodities market research at Rabobank, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Europe\" last week. \"Once this [grain] corridor is over, we might see even more price increases going forward,\" Mera said. Consumers could also see further price increases as there is normally a lag of three to nine months before a movement in commodity prices is reflected on supermarket shelves. Then there is the pressure of exporting enough grain as quickly as possible from a war zone. \"It's time that we're working again. I don't see us exporting two [to] five million tons per month out of these Black Sea ports,\" John Rich, the executive chairman of Ukrainian poultry giant Myronivsky Hliboproduct (MHP), told CNBC's \"Capital Connection\" on Monday. \"Hungry people, at the end of the day, get hungry very quickly after a week.\" In a note published earlier this month, credit rating agency Fitch Ratings' analysts wrote that a possible increase in fertilizer prices, which fell recently \u2014 but which are still double that of 2020 \u2014 could cause grain prices to jump again. Russia's restriction of gas supply has led European natural gas prices to spike. Natural gas is a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers. La Nina weather patterns could disrupt grain harvests later this year as well, they added.\n\nAnd the fall in food prices is not all good news. Part of the reason why staples have become cheaper is that traders and investors are pricing in recessionary fears, the analysts said. The global manufacturing purchasing managers' index has been in decline, while the U.S. Federal Reserve seems bent on raising interest rates to curb inflation even if it triggers a recession, the Fitch team wrote.\n\nFood staples",

        "text": "Like his cappuccinos, Taniel Vaaderpass, 33, isn\u2019t bitter. His usually profitable company, OA Coffee, one of Estonia\u2019s biggest coffee bean roasting companies, may have posted a loss for the first time last year and is set to do so again this year, but Vaaderpass remains strikingly sanguine as he sits on the terrace of the cafe he also owns on a cobbled street in the old town of Tallinn.\n\nThe central causes of Vaaderpass\u2019s misfortune is a 240% increase in the price of unroasted green coffee and a 20% surge in the cost of the gas he uses to roast his imported beans. He also felt the need to give his staff a 10% pay rise in January despite the lack of company profits.\n\nThis is the reality of living in Europe\u2019s inflation hotspot. The latest figures, published on Thursday, showed that Estonia has an annual inflation rate of an astounding 23.2% \u2013 the highest in the eurozone, vastly outpacing the average of 8.9%.\n\nVaaderpass is inevitably part of the cycle. He has raised his price to supermarkets by 25% over the last eight months and he fears he will have to do so again this year. A coffee in his cafe is today half a euro more expensive than it was, and Vaaderpass says he will also have to cut costs to get \u201cback on track\u201d.\n\nBut he is not on the streets calling for the government\u2019s downfall. No Estonians are. Indeed the latest polling has the Reform party, the largest party in the ruling coalition, flying high with 34.4% of the vote, and their conservative rivals on 21.3%, six months before the national elections.\n\n\u201cEstonians are not that temperamental,\u201d Vaaderpass says. \u201cCalm northern people. No emotions, you know. The joke is that when Covid hit and people couldn\u2019t meet, it was a lucky day for Estonians. Celebration day.\u201d\n\nA woman picking nectarines at Balti Jaama market in Tallinn. Photograph: Hendrik Osula/The Guardian\n\nPart of the explanation for the lack of a political backlash may be that Estonian salaries have been on a sharp upward trajectory for several years and the economy recovered well and quickly from the Covid pandemic, leading to labour shortages and higher wages. Voters are relatively relaxed about a temporary period of higher prices, it is suggested.\n\nBut there is also an understanding in Estonia, once part of the Soviet Union and containing a large Russian-language minority, that the war in Ukraine is the source of many of their problems, says Kaspar Oja, an economist at Estonia\u2019s central bank.\n\n\u201cIn many countries people have gone to the streets even with lower inflation rates, but here people are quite calm,\u201d he says. \u201cOf course there are people who complain, but most people understand that the increase in energy prices is broadly related to the war and they understand what it is behind it.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, something percolating, he admits.\n\nEstonia\u2019s standout inflation rate is also due to some peculiarities in its economy, and potentially some governmental missteps that may be seized upon. Recent pension reforms have allowed people to dip into their nest eggs to spend now rather than later. A large proportion of consumers are on energy deals that are linked to the market price rather than fixed.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Estonia remains a relatively poor country within the EU, and so energy and food prices make up an oversized part of consumer spending.\n\n\u201cLately there have been more complaints about the electricity because they can see companies have benefited from it,\u201dOja says. \u201cConsumers are paying more but Estonia has energy producers which are benefiting pretty well and people are not happy about that. That is why the government is planning to have a universal electricity service for small consumers, mostly households, to take effect from October. The electricity companies will have to sell electricity according to the production costs.\u201d\n\nIt is also, however, starting to be noticed in the media how little the prime minister, Kaja Kallas, who has spoken of the need to keep tight control over spending, has offered in terms of mitigation on energy prices.\n\nJacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute For International Economics, says the latest inflation figures show that the more interventionist governments, such as the French, with the lowest annual inflation rate in the eurozone at 6.8%, and the Italians (8.4%), have done best in shielding their voters from the inflationary pressures.\n\n\u201cThe underlying issue is that the Estonians haven\u2019t done very much,\u201d Kirkegaard says. \u201cThe French have been largely insulated because of the nuclear production and they haven\u2019t had nearly the same pass through. This is unlikely to last because if you look at the forward energy pricing in France, it is higher than most of the rest of the Europe as the fear is that the river levels are so low that they will have to take the nuclear plants off the grid because they will not have the water to cool them.\n\n\u201cBut the government has done quite a lot. They have nationalised EDF [the country\u2019s largest energy company] fully and it will do what the government wants. They have also raised public benefits to low-wage people by up to 10% to basically try to mitigate the cost of living for low-income groups.\u201d\n\nBaristas Elizabeth Liiv (left) and Anastasia Kralle at OA Coffee cafe say the understand why prices are rising. Photograph: Hendrik Osula/The Guardian\n\nThe link between lower inflation rates and intervention should not be lost on Boris Johnson\u2019s successor in the UK, Kirkegaard suggests. According to data released by the Office for National Statistics this week, consumer price inflation in Britain jumped to 10.1% in July, the highest since February 1982, making it the first major economy to see price growth hit double digits.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that the UK when it comes to fiscal transfers or direct government help hasn\u2019t done much compared to the continent, certainly southern Europe and France and the pass through of costs has been much larger,\u201d he says. \u201cI would say the UK is one of the least activist major governments.\u201d\n\nIt is yet to be seen whether British voters will be as relaxed as those in Estonia. In central Tallinn, Lisa, 34, a psychotherapist picking up some fruit at the covered Balti Jaama Turg market, says she is buying fewer cosmetics and opting for secondhand clothes over new ones, but is more concerned about the fate of Russians and Ukrainians than that of the Estonian economy. \u201cI feel sad about that rather than angry,\u201d she says.\n\nAnastasia Kralle, 21, and Elizabeth Liiv, 17, serving at the OA Coffee cafe, agree. \u201cI have noticed the price of eggs keeps on going up, every time I go to the shops,\u201d laughs Kralle. \u201cYes, everything is more expensive, but I don\u2019t want to be angry. I am not blaming anyone, we all know why it is happening.\u201d",

        "text": "(Click here to subscribe to the Delivering Alpha newsletter.)\n\nWhen Peter Kraus founded Aperture Investors, he deviated from the traditional active management model. Rather than raking in fixed fees, Kraus' $3.8 billion firm operates on a fee structure linked to performance, charging 30 percent of alpha. That's higher than the industry standard but since inception, about half of Aperture's funds have delivered alpha above their benchmarks. Kraus sat down with CNBC's Delivering Alpha newsletter to explain why he's focused on a pay-for-performance set-up and how he's putting capital to work in the current environment.\n\n(The below has been edited for length and clarity. See above for full video.)\n\nLeslie Picker: What do you see as the key problem with the traditional model? And what do you think is the best way to fix it?\n\nPeter Kraus: The key problem is very simple. The existing model in almost all cases, rewards people whether or not they perform. So, it's a fixed fee and as assets grow, you earn more money. Well, clients don't actually hire us to grow our assets, they hire us to perform. So, you would think the performance fee or the actual fee would be connected to the performance as opposed to the asset growth. We also know that asset growth is the enemy of performance. It's harder and harder to perform, the more assets that you manage. So, the fee doesn't help you - that traditional fee doesn't help in that regard, because the manager is incentivized to continue to grow assets, and that makes it harder and harder to perform.\n\nOf course, there are performance fees in the marketplace and hedge funds and private equity, but they also have rather large management fees. So, they too have some incentive to grow their assets. Basically Aperture is the anathema to that - it's the opposite. We charge a very low base fee that's equal to the ETF and then we only charge if we beat the index. So, you pay for performance. If we don't have any performance, you pay what you pay to buy the ETF.\n\nPicker: So, then how do you choose which index is relevant for the specific strategies?. I mean, do you invest in certain ways that would mirror or would be comparable to certain indexes that you're able to then outperform?\n\nKraus: Exactly. So, we're very, very thoughtful about the index because we're actually charging people to beat the index. So, for example, in global equities, we would use the MSCI global equity index. For U.S. small cap, we would use the Russell 2000. For European equities, we would use the Euro Stoxx Index. Very simple indices, not complex, no real question about whether the manager is actually creating a portfolio that is following that index. In fact, we actually test the correlation of the portfolio to the index to make sure the index continues to be relevant.\n\nPicker: People who advocate for their management fee will say that it's necessary, essentially, to keep the lights on - that it basically ensures that the operations of the fund can meet all of their fixed costs and cover their expenses. How are you able to do so with a lower management fee?\n\nKraus: People say, well, I need to keep the lights on. Well, okay, how many assets do you need to keep the lights on? And once you have the lights on, then do you need to keep charging the fixed fee? Because your incentive is just to continue to gather assets. So, it's really a function of how many assets we have and we've created a company where we think that assets scale pretty much speaks for revenues to cover the fixed expenses. And then the rest is only earned if we perform. One of the things that I like about Aperture is that I'm incentivized, as the owner of the business identically with the client. I don't make much money, if any money, unless we actually perform.\n\nPicker: What about your ability to recruit and pay employees? Does it have any bearing on compensation?\n\nKraus: Sure does. The portfolio managers are paid a strict percentage of the performance fee. So, portfolio managers are usually paid 35% of the 30% that we charge. We charge a 30% performance fee and we pay the management, to the portfolio managers and their team, 35% of that. And we've selected that percentage because we think that that is highly competitive with both the hedge fund industry as well as the long-only industry. And if managers perform on the amount of capital that they have, their compensation can be quite attractive. And that's, in effect, how we believe we can attract some of the best talent in the marketplace.\n\nPicker: It doesn't appear though, at least in the current environment, that LPs are too dissuaded by the traditional model. I mean, there were nearly 200 hedge fund launches in Q1 outpacing the number of liquidations. AUM stands around $4 trillion for the hedge fund industry overall. So, it doesn't appear that LPS have really been pushing back, at least in terms of new launches and total AUM size. So, I'm just curious kind of what your conversations have been like on that front?\n\nKraus: Well, there's $4 trillion in the hedge fund community but there's $32 trillion in the long-only community. And I don't think that it's a question that is hard to answer. If you look at the trend between the active management industry and the passive industry, money's been moving to the passive industry at a rapid pace - unchanged for 10 years. And the hedge fund space, the $4 trillion - we're talking about all sorts of different types of hedge funds, for sure, it's not a monolithic industry. But essentially, most managers or most allocators that I speak to would rather not pay a performance fee times the beta that their money is exposed to. They would like to pay a performance fee for actually the performance. And so, we offer that clarity, which many hedge funds do not. And in the long-only space, there's virtually no payment for performance. It's almost all fixed.\n\nPicker: Since there's so much on the line with regard to performance, I have to ask you, what's your strategy? What's your what's your thinking right now? How are you putting capital to work in the current environment in a way that you believe will outperform the benchmarks?\n\nKraus: It depends upon the strategy, whether it's an equity strategy or fixed income strategy. But in the equity strategies, we are what you would expect - highly research dependent, looking for specific opportunities with companies that we think have long term growth, or undervalue and will accelerate their value over time. And that timeframe is usually 18 months to three years. In the credit space, again, it's fundamental research to find credits and obviously being careful about the market because credit markets tend to be more macro driven. But it's all of the above and that's what we spend our time doing. We think that if we do that consistently over time, we can perform.\n\nPicker: Are you net long or net short in the current environment?\n\nKraus: Interestingly enough, in the one hedge fund that we do run, we're pretty close to flat. So, I would say a very low net position. In the other funds that we run, we run 100% long. So, in other words, we are what I call beta one, exposed to the index by 100%. But we do have shorts, so we're gross more than 100% in those funds. But I would say in general, right now, our risk positions are low.\n\nPicker: So, not much leverage then?\n\nKraus: Not much leverage, but more importantly, the actual stocks and bonds that we are choosing and the positions we're taking, we're on, I would say, the low end of our risk scale.",

But while the model has gained traction, it has been difficult to pin down how fast the ranks of gig workers are growing.\n\nThe most accurate measure is Internal Revenue Service data on 1099 tax forms \u2014 the freelancers\u2019 counterpart to the W-2 forms filed for employees \u2014 but that is available only to select researchers and released with a lag of several years. At last count, in 2018, a team of economists found that about 1.2 percent of workers with any earnings had at least some income from online platform work. (A Pew survey from 2021 found that the share of all adults with gig income in a 12-month period was about 9 percent.)\n\nThe closest government metric that is more timely comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which asks people whether they count themselves as self-employed. That number rose significantly as a share of the labor force from early 2020 to early this year. But it generally captures people for whom self-employment is the main source of income \u2014 which, for most gig workers, it isn\u2019t. More likely, the bump represents an increase in the number of people working as home improvement contractors and owner-operator truck drivers \u2014 two longtime means of self-employment that surged during the pandemic \u2014 and some white-collar freelancers.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nThe consumer outlook for inflation decreased significantly in July amid a sharp drop in gas prices and a growing belief that the rapid surges in food and housing also would ebb in the future. The New York Federal Reserve's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations showed that respondents expect inflation to run at a 6.2% pace over the next year and a 3.2% rate for the next three years. While those numbers are still very high by historical standards, they mark a big drop-off from the respective 6.8% and 3.6% results from the June survey. Through June, food prices rose 10.4% over the past year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They are still expected to climb 6.7% over the next 12 months, but that's a decline from the June survey of 2.5 percentage points, the biggest fall in a data series going back to June 2013.\n\nLikewise, respondents see gas prices, which rose 60% over the past year, increasing at just a 1.5% pace over the next year, a slide of 4.2 percentage points from June, the second-biggest monthly decline in the survey's history. The price of regular gas has come down about 67 cents a gallon over the past month though it remains 87 cents higher than a year ago, according to AAA. Commodity prices overall have been falling significantly as well. Finally, home prices are expected to rise 3.5% from June's 4.4%, the lowest projected gain since November 2020. Five-year inflation expectations also slipped, dropping 0.5 percentage point to 2.3%.",

A growing number are being left with no option but to stop trading.\n\nA Labour analysis showed that there were a record 20,200 fewer businesses in the second quarter of this year \u2013 the largest loss in this period since records began. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cShops, cafes and pubs risk going to the wall because this government has failed to get to grips with the energy crisis.\u201d\n\nMPs said their inboxes were full of messages from desperate small-business owners warning they would have to shut up shop. Sarah Olney, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson, said the country needed to see \u201cbold proposals from the government before it\u2019s too late for Britain\u2019s high streets and entrepreneurs \u2026 The October energy price cap rise has to be scrapped\u201d.\n\nShuttered shops in Bristol. Photograph: Alamy\n\nThe Tory leadership candidates are under pressure to spell out their plans to help businesses with the costs of energy, as well as consumers. After the Guardian asked both what they would do, a spokesperson for Rishi Sunak\u2019s campaign said he had \u201cstood by thousands of businesses during Covid\u201d and he \u201ccrucially understands the urgent need to first get inflation under control, help people with the cost of living in the short term and then grow the economy\u201d.\n\nLocal newspapers are reporting multiple businesses disappearing from high streets, while people have shared stories on social media of much-loved neighbourhood shops, cafes and takeaways throwing in the towel, depriving communities of valuable jobs.\n\nThe residents of Coppull in Lancashire are now without a fish and chip shop for the first time in 40 years, after the owner of Oh My Cod pulled the plug following a dispute with his energy supplier, taking four jobs and a delivery driver role with it.\n\nIts owner, Andrew Crook, was quoted electricity prices of 80p per kilowatt-hour for daytime usage for the Coppull shop \u2013 nearly eight times higher than the 11.5p/kWh he pays under a contract in his other premises.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m going to have to sit it out until the prices come back down,\u2019 said Crook, the owner of Oh My Cod in Coppull, Lancashire. Photograph: Joel Goodman/The Guardian\n\n\u201cWith what it would take to get the business going again, the energy prices just don\u2019t stack up,\u201d said Crook, who also speaks for the industry as the president of the National Federation of Fish Friers. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to sit it out until the prices come back down.\u201d\n\nOne of Crooks\u2019 members, the owner of the Weeping Cross Fish Bar in Stafford, has been quoted an annual energy bill of \u00a336,000, six times higher than the \u00a36,000 he has been paying to date.\n\nFriday marked the last day of trading for Minshull\u2019s Country Kitchen, a cafe in Sandbach, Cheshire. After eight successful years of producing \u201cnanny\u2019s cooking\u201d \u2013 from quiches and stews to pies and crumbles \u2013 Paul Minshull has decided to call it a day, fearful of the rising energy bills and an impending recession.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We couldn\u2019t sustain the next ones,\u201d he said. \u201cI can see what the next few years are going to bring and it\u2019s not going to end any time soon.\u201d\n\nMinshull, 30, is instead going to work as a restaurant manager at a local pub run by his friend, where he knows he will have a regular income.\n\nVal Burrows, who has owned the West Street Laundry in East Grinstead, West Sussex for 10 years, is weighing up whether she can afford to keep her business going.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d she said. Her utility contract came to an end in July, and even though she had expected increased costs, she was shocked to see the price shoot up by 173%, taking the annual bill from \u00a36,000 to \u00a316,000.\n\n\u201cBusinesses need more help to get us through this,\u201d she said. She called for the government to shoulder some of the burden. \u201cI am a sole trader, so I am liable personally for rent, rate and utilities, so I have got to get through, and if at the end of the year there is no help I\u2019ll just have to shut the door.\u201d\n\nIn Aberdeen, this month saw the end of the Royal Crown takeaway, which has been run by Martin Tang\u2019s family since the 1980s. It came after he was hit by a tenfold increase in energy bills from his supplier, SSE.\n\nNatalie Hood, who worked at the takeaway, wrote on Twitter of her sadness as they prepared to lock the doors for the final time. \u201cWe\u2019re one of the first local businesses in Aberdeen to be forced to close, we won\u2019t be the last. Something needs to be done!\u201d\n\nCustomers of the Ainsty Farm Shop at Kirk Hammerton, near York, were informed by the owners that they were closing their doors at the end of September \u201cbecause of the huge rise in electricity prices\u201d.\n\nStuart and Lily Beaton posted on Facebook that the impending increase in energy bills made it impossible to continue trading after their electricity contract ends at the end of next month.\n\nThe Beatons, who have run the business for 22 years and been in the same premises for 17, wrote: \u201cAs you probably all understand, running a butchery, bakery and deli uses a lot of electricity and we can now no longer carry on.\u201d\n\nIt was a \u00a34,000 electricity bill for 10 weeks\u2019 usage \u2013 double the previous cost \u2013 that prompted the owner of a tearoom in Portstewart, Northern Ireland, to shut up shop. Richard Stewart-Brown told the Belfast Telegraph he had usually paid \u00a32,000 for energy since opening the Molly Brown\u2019s tearoom in 2018. He posted on Facebook that \u201can increase in rent, food costs at an all-time high and energy costs through the roof\u201d pushed the family to make their decision.\n\nThe Italian restaurant Santoni in Keighley, West Yorkshire, will welcome diners for the final time on Saturday, as the owner, Marco Di Rienzo, has decided to call it a day after five years. Hit by rising food prices and energy bills, Di Rienzo told Yorkshire Live he had made the difficult decision not to renew his lease.\n\nThe FSB\u2019s survey of traders found that 15% expected to downsize or close in the next 12 months, while 39% said they would not grow at all.\n\nThe outlook for some sectors is better than others: 63% of IT and communications businesses expected to grow, compared with only 34% of wholesale and retail firms, and 35% of hospitality operators.\n\n\u201cAny cost of living plan worth the name needs to tackle the mounting energy bills small firms face,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cSupport is urgently required to stop driving prices for hard-up consumers ever higher and more small firms out of business.\u201d\n\nShe is calling for the energy rebate issued through the council tax system to be extended to the business rates system, along with other measures including cutting VAT on energy consumption, and direct help for small firms that don\u2019t pay business rates.",

Shorting the S&P 500 futures is a common way to bet against the broader stock market but also could be part of a hedging strategy.\n\nThe bearish bets accumulated as the S&P 500 rallied for four straight weeks, bouncing more than 17% off its 52-week low from June 16. Economic data pointing to easing price pressures firmed the belief that Federal Reserve is getting inflation under control.\n\n\"As powerful as the market rally has been, it is being viewed with substantial skepticism,\" said Mark Hackett, Nationwide's chief of investment research.",

While that has been good for exporters \u2014 whose products have grown cheaper for foreign customers \u2014 it has driven up prices of imports, which have already become more expensive because of shortages and supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nWhile inflation in Japan \u2014 at around 2 percent in June \u2014 is still much lower than in many other countries, it has forced some companies to substantially raise prices for the first time in years, potentially dampening demand from consumers accustomed to paying the same amounts year after year.\n\nThe gradual return to normal economic activity produced strong growth in private investment, Monday\u2019s data showed.\n\nThe growth was driven in part by spending to improve companies\u2019 sustainability and digital infrastructure \u2014 efforts strongly promoted by government policies, said Wakaba Kobayashi, an economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research.\n\nStill, it is not clear how long that growth can continue, she said. Among many businesses, \u201cthere is a sense that the global economy is going to continue to decelerate,\u201d she said. The economies of the United States, China and Europe have slowed more rapidly than expected in recent months because of the Ukraine war, inflation and the pandemic.\n\nJapan faces other challenges both at home and abroad.

        "text": "Post Office has attributed the record amount for personal cash withdrawals at its 11,500 branches to more staycations in the U.K. and people using cash to manage their budgets. Gannet77 | Getty Images\n\nBritain's Post Office, which offers banking services as well as mail, handled a record \u00a3801 million ($967 million) in personal cash withdrawals in July. In total, more than \u00a33.3 billion in cash was withdrawn and deposited over the Post Office's counters \u2014 the first time the amount has crossed the \u00a33.3 billion threshold in its 360-year history. Personal cash withdrawals were up almost 8% month on month at \u00a3744 in June, and up over 20% from a year ago to \u00a3665 million in July.\n\nStaycations and budgeting\n\nThe spike in cash use is down to several factors. \"Firstly, more people use cash when they go on staycation, secondly, the Post Office helped to hand out support to energy customers in the form of cash, and thirdly, people are using it as a budgeting method,\" said Laura Suter, head of finance at AJ Bell. The Post Office research found that 71% of Brits planning to go on holiday in the U.K. this year intend to take out cash before doing so. Of those who have holidayed in the U.K. in the last five years, almost a third admitted to being caught out by not having cash on them. In July, the Post Office processed more than 600,000 cash payouts for people eligible for energy bill support from the British government. That came to around \u00a390 million and allowed people to pay energy bills, top up gas and electricity meters or use cash for easier budgeting. In total, \u00a33.31 billion in cash deposits and withdrawals were processed at the Post Office in July, \u00a3100 million higher than in June. The data comes as the country continues to grapple with rising inflation. The Bank of England expects headline inflation to peak at 13.3% in October and to remain at elevated levels throughout much of 2023.\n\nIs it here to stay?",

The rule changes could include raising the threshold for strike action \u2013 already fairly stringent in the UK \u2013 and limit the number of strikes unions can carry out once they have received the backing of votes. She will push through changes \u201cwithin a month of becoming Prime Minister\u201d, the Express reported.

Photograph: Septemberlegs Editorial/Alamy The UK\u2019s transport department has announced \u00a3130m of funding for England\u2019s bus network to make up for shortfalls in revenues caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The cash will help to cover six months of operations by the private companies who run England\u2019s buses from October 2022 to March 2023, the government said. Bus companies \u2013 like other parts of the UK\u2019s struggling public transport industry \u2013 have been fighting to attract customers back to their routes after passenger numbers slumped during the coronavirus lockdowns. The government gave bus providers their first bailout (worth \u00a3400m) in April 2020 in order to protect routes while passenger numbers were down. Since then the value of funding made available to 160 companies has reached \u00a32bn, the government said on Friday. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary who has had a busy day, said: At a time when people are worried about rising costs, it\u2019s more important than ever we save these bus routes for the millions who rely on them for work, school and shopping. The Confederation of Passenger Transport, a lobby group for the bus and coach industry, perhaps unsurprisingly welcomed the money. A CPT spokesperson said: Today\u2019s announcement will help bus operators and local authority partners to balance a network of reliable and affordable services in the short-term as bus networks adapt to new travel patterns. For the longer-term, we will continue to work closely with central government and local authorities to encourage existing and new passengers to get on board the country\u2019s buses, ensuring they are provided the best possible services.\n\n\n\n4d ago 13.52 John McDonnell MP (centre) joining the picket line outside Euston Station as railway workers stage an earlier 24-hour walk-out on 27 July. Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/REX/Shutterstock Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said the UK government should match public-sector pay increases to inflation. Matching consumer price index inflation of 10.1% annually would imply billions of pounds of extra spending, and many economists including the Bank of England would argue that it would itself feed through into higher inflation. Speaking to BBC Radio 4, he said: I think that\u2019s the only way that we can protect them [households] from sinking into, in some instances, poverty. McDonnell said the roots of the discontent go back 12 years to the global financial crisis, and the austerity policies brought in by the Conservative government in its aftermath. He said: There\u2019s a build-up of a whole range of unions, some of whom have never been on strike before, faced with members saying to them, \u2018We cannot survive with the wages we have at the moment\u2019. We need to inflation-proof our wages. The unions are responding to their members. McDonnell argued that most of the inflationary pressure facing the UK is from external factors, citing the Bank of England. Those pressures are coming from supply chain snarl-ups caused by Covid-19 lockdowns (most notably in China) and the surge in energy prices accelerated by concerns that Russian President Vladimir Putin will cut off gas supplies to Europe as part of his response to his country\u2019s isolation following its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n4d ago 13.28 Transport secretary Grant Shapps has blamed the unions for not putting a pay offer to a vote of members for London\u2019s strikes. The union has the backing of members for the strike action, after receiving 91.1% of votes in favour in a ballot in late June that drew a 53.1% turnout. But Shapps wants the union to put an offered pay rise of 8% over two years to members. That is significantly lower than the 10.1% level of inflation in a single year, and would therefore imply that workers receive a real-terms pay cut. Shapps told the BBC radio: It\u2019s certainly enormously disruptive, particularly in the capital today where the strikes are focused. But look, overall I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to be having these strikes at all. A very fair pay offer has gone on the table on the wider network of 8% over two years. This is no compulsory redundancies in return for modernising work practices that should have gone out with the ark. If only the union bosses would actually put that offer to their members I\u2019m pretty sure this strike would be over.\n\n\n\n4d ago 13.07 Sadiq Khan has been on the media rounds today. He has told BBC London that he believes the current government is \u201canti-London\u201d. This is building on his earlier criticism that the government is using the strikes as an opportunity to provoke unions into industrial action that may be unpopular with some segments of the population. Khan said: Of course I understand their concerns. I\u2019m the person who has been vocal about the concerns that Londoners have, including transport workers, businesses, about some of the conditions the government\u2019s been trying to attach. I think this is an anti-London government. I think they\u2019ve been trying to use this as an opportunity to provoke the trade unions, and I worry that we\u2019re falling into the government\u2019s trap. What today does is give the government an opportunity to criticise trade unions, transport workers [\u2026] It\u2019s Londoners who have done nothing wrong who are caught in the crossfire.\n\n\n\n4d ago 11.42 Liz Truss pledges 'crackdown on debilitating strikes' Foreign secretary and Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss at the Conservative Party leadership election hustings at the Culloden Hotel, Belfast, on 17 August. Photograph: Mark Marlow/EPA The frontrunner to be the UK\u2019s next prime minister has made her views on unions clear: she has approvingly tweeted a report that she intends to make striking more difficult. \u201cNew laws will make it harder to call strikes and also guarantee minimum levels of service are maintained on public transport\u201d, according to a report by the Daily Express, a newspaper which is strongly pro-government and is supporting Truss in the Conservative leadership race. The rule changes could include raising the threshold for strike action \u2013 already fairly stringent in the UK \u2013 and limit the number of strikes unions can carry out once they have received the backing of votes. She will push through changes \u201cwithin a month of becoming Prime Minister\u201d, the Express reported. As Prime Minister, I will not let our country be held to ransom by militant trade unionists.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcac @Daily_Express: https://t.co/hGjPNPZLqH pic.twitter.com/AhzPtfbk0b \u2014 Liz for Leader (@trussliz) August 19, 2022 The European Federation of Public Service Unions (EPSU) describes UK strike laws as \u201ccomplex and multi-layered with detailed regulations introduced by Conservative governments over years\u201d. This already includes a requirement for 40% of the total workforce (including those who don\u2019t vote) to vote in favour of action. If the strike is in important public services, 4\u20e30\u20e3% of the total workforce must vote in favour of the action.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc6e\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc6e\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0fPolices are also limited in terms of union membership and the right to strike.

The balloon got caught in overhead wires, the rail operator said. Thameslink, run by Govia, is the UK\u2019s largest rail franchise, operating lines such as those between Bedford and Brighton through London. \u26a0\ufe0f We have been advised that a balloon is caught on the overhead electric wires at Royston.\n\n\n\nYour journey will be delayed by up to 15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\u2139\ufe0f More to follow. \u2014 Thameslink (@TLRailUK) August 19, 2022 The balloon has since been removed, and the line has been reopened. Here was the offending item: \ud83c\udf88 Apologies for the delay today, we're hoping to get you on the move as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfab Tickets will also be accepted on alternative Thameslink/Great Northern routes to help reach your intended destination. pic.twitter.com/R8GNbiGbZS \u2014 Thameslink (@TLRailUK) August 19, 2022\n\nUpdated at 11.04 BST",

Kohl's most recent quarter beat Street forecasts for revenue and profit.\n\nBJ's Wholesale (BJ) \u2013 The warehouse retailer beat estimates by 26 cents with an adjusted quarterly profit of $1.06 per share and revenue also topped forecasts. Comparable store sales increased more than expected, and the stock rallied 5.4% in premarket trading.\n\nTapestry (TPR) \u2013 Tapestry moved between gains and losses in premarket action after its earnings came in above consensus despite sales that were slightly short of forecasts. The company behind luxury brands Coach and Kate Spade also raised its quarterly dividend by 20%.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) \u2013 Estee Lauder shares fell 1.3% in the premarket after the cosmetics maker forecast full-year sales below consensus, due to Covid-related lockdowns in China. Estee Lauder's profit and revenue for its most recent quarter beat Wall Street estimates.\n\nCanadian Solar (CSIQ) \u2013 The solar equipment and services company reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and solar module shipments that were at the high end of its prior forecast. Canadian Solar also raised its full-year revenue forecast, and its stock jumped 6.2% in premarket trading.\n\nBath & Body Works (BBWI) \u2013 Bath & Body Works reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, but gave a current-quarter forecast that was weaker than expected. The personal care products retailer also said it eliminated 130 positions as it moves to control costs and become more efficient.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) \u2013 Cisco rallied 5% in premarket trading after beating top and bottom line estimates for its latest quarter. The networking equipment maker also gave a stronger-than-expected outlook for the current quarter as supply chain issues ease.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) \u2013 Bed Bath & Beyond tumbled 14.4% in the premarket after investor Ryan Cohen filed a notice of intent to sell 7.78 million shares of the housewares retailer. Cohen's prior purchases of call options had contributed to a buying spree in Bed Bath & Beyond, with the stock up in 15 of the past 16 sessions and increasing more than five-fold in value over that time.\n\nWolfspeed (WOLF) \u2013 Wolfspeed rocketed higher by 20.9% in the premarket after the semiconductor company reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss and revenue that beat consensus estimates. It also projected a loss for the current quarter that falls largely below what analysts had been anticipating.\n\nDCP Midstream (DCP) \u2013 DCP Midstream added 1.7% in premarket trading after refiner Phillips 66 offered to buy the pipeline operator's publicly held shares for $34.75 per share.",

Workers have complained that the company has made its benefits less generous in recent years, though some benefits have improved more recently.\n\nBut Ms. Ryther said she and her colleagues were also concerned that the store, which is in an area where some residents struggle with drug dependency and mental health challenges, appeared not to have protocols or systems in place to handle certain emergencies. She cited a person who came into the store last fall with what appeared to be a gunshot wound and collapsed into her arms.\n\nPolice officers arrived quickly, Ms. Ryther said, but Trader Joe\u2019s did little to address the aftermath, such as explaining to workers what had happened. Several days passed before she was told that she could collect workers\u2019 compensation while taking time off to deal with the trauma, she said.",

Those moves were aimed at subduing inflation running at its highest level in more than 40 years.\n\nIn addition to the hikes, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee indicated that \"ongoing increases ... will be appropriate,\" a view Bowman said she endorses.\n\n\"My view is that similarly sized increases should be on the table until we see inflation declining in a consistent, meaningful, and lasting way,\" she added in prepared remarks in Colorado for the Kansas Bankers Association.\n\nBowman's comments are the first from a member of the Board of Governors since the FOMC last week approved the latest rate increase. Over the past week, multiple regional presidents have said they also expect rates to continue to rise aggressively until inflation falls from its current 9.1% annual rate.",

        "text": "Middle Eastern states are to land a $1.3tn (\u00a31.09tn) windfall from extra oil revenues over the next four years, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe IMF said on Friday it expected oil and gas exporters in the region, notably the Gulf states, to benefit from high prices and opportunities to ramp up their market share.\n\nThe oil and gas sector is in flux after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which has upended markets and sent prices soaring. Russia has increased exports of oil to Asian nations, while Vladimir Putin\u2019s tactic of limiting gas supplies into Europe has left countries seeking new supply sources.\n\nJihad Azour, the IMF\u2019s director for the Middle East and north Africa, told the Financial Times that countries in the Middle East could expect to receive $1.3tn more in cumulative revenues than was forecast before the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHe said Gulf states needed to use the windfall to \u201cinvest in the future\u201d, including efforts to switch towards greener energy sources. \u201cIt\u2019s an important moment for them to \u2026 accelerate in sectors like technology [domestically] as this is something that will allow them to increase productivity,\u201d Azour said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, their investment strategy could benefit from the fact that asset prices have improved for new investors, and the capacity to increase their market share in certain areas are also opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe windfall is expected to benefit some of the world\u2019s biggest sovereign wealth funds, including the Qatar Investment Authority, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), the Kuwait Investment Authority and Abu Dhabi\u2019s Mubadala and ADQ.\n\nGulf states are expected to spend the proceeds of the oil boom on building huge infrastructure projects, as well as investing overseas.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

PIF, chaired by the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, invested more than $7.5bn in US stocks in the second quarter of the year, including Amazon and PayPal.\n\nThe energy crisis shows little sign of easing, after the Russian state gas company, Gazprom, warned this week that European gas prices could soar by 60% to more than $4,000 per 1,000 cubic metres this winter.\n\nOn Friday, Wolfgang Kubicki, the vice-president of the German parliament, said Germany should allow the blocked Nord Stream 2 (NS2) pipeline to begin pumping Russian natural gas so \u201cpeople do not have to freeze in winter and that our industry does not suffer serious damage\u201d. There are fears of blackouts in Germany this winter as the country faces the prospect of a potential recession.\n\nUkraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, rebuked Kubicki, likening politicians\u2019 demands to temporarily switch the pipeline on to a \u201cdrug addiction\u201d. He said: \u201cCalls by some German politicians to launch NS2 for a little while and close it later are totally irrational.\n\n\u201cThis resembles drug addiction, when a person says: \u2018Just one last time!\u2019 without realising the devastating consequences of each \u2018last time\u2019. Addiction to Russian gas kills!\u201d\n\nThe extent of the energy crisis in Britain is expected to be laid bare on 26 August when Ofgem sets the next industry price cap, which will be implemented in October. The cap is expected to rise from \u00a31,971 to \u00a33,582.",

        "text": "In this article MMAT\n\n\"We're really just scratching the surface of what we're going to see [in the metaverse],\" said Randi Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media. Wildpixel | Istock | Getty Images\n\nA smooth and \"complete decentralization\" of Web3 is not yet a reality, said Randi Zuckerberg, referring to a system in which users rather than companies have ownership of services and data. The sister of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was speaking at the Global Supertrends Conference 2022 on Wednesday. The Web3 is a hypothetical, future version of the internet based on blockchain technology \u2014 an \"ideal utopia,\" said Zuckerberg. \"But \u2026 that's not what's happening. What's happening in reality, is chaos.\"\n\nThe founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media, a production company and marketing consultancy, added, \"You're the only one watching your own back and your own assets, people are spending time protecting themselves by setting up so many different wallets and protecting their identity and that's not contributing to development in the area.\" Zuckerberg, who was an early employee at Meta \u2014 formerly known as Facebook \u2014 explained that various metaverses are now acting as \"their own walled garden,\" in which users are unable to use their assets across platforms. The metaverse can be loosely defined as a virtual world where people live, work and play. With cryptocurrency, users can buy and develop virtual land or dress their own avatars.\n\n\"Right now, I'm on Decentraland, my son is on Roblox, my other son is on Fortnite. That's great \u2014 we're all in the metaverse. [But] we have no interaction with one another,\" she said. \"In order to really unlock the potential [of Web3], we're going to need to figure out a system where there's interoperability. What you have goes with you wherever you are, [and] we're not there yet,\" Zuckerberg added.\n\nGoing mainstream\n\nHowever, according to Zuckerberg, that's easier said than done because no company running a metaverse right now wants to give up control or \"share that ownership.\" \"That's why it's not we're not seeing that kind of consumer mainstream adoption yet because there needs to be a world where you leave the house with one wallet. And you need to see that same behavior online also.\" She added that Web3 needs experts who have been involved in the global banking system and Web2 \u2014 the internet that we know today \u2014 to lend a \"protective layer.\"\n\nThe need for such experts is all the more important because it has been \"too easy\" for users to be scammed or lose all their assets in Web3, said Zuckerberg. \"There needs to be more protections for consumers \u2026 I think we will wind up [with] web 2.7, where there is some centralization, keeping people safe, but the ability to port your assets with you to any site.\" Another thing that needs to be improved in Web3 is user-friendliness, she added. \"It should not take 45 steps to set up a cryptocurrency wallet, buy a currency and enter the metaverse. It needs to [be] one-stop, beginner-friendly.\"\n\nSectors with opportunities",

        "text": "'We should have an objective definition'\n\nOfficially, the NBER defines a recession as \"a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.\" In fact, the latest quarterly gross domestic product report, which tracks the overall health of the economy, showed a second consecutive contraction this year. Still, if the NBER ultimately declares a recession, it could be months from now, and it will factor in other considerations, as well, such as employment and personal income.\n\nWhat really matters is their paychecks aren't reaching as far. Tomas Philipson former acting chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers\n\nThat puts the country in a gray area, Philipson said. \"Why do we let an academic group decide?\" he said. \"We should have an objective definition, not the opinion of an academic committee.\"\n\nConsumers are behaving like we're in a recession\n\nFor now, consumers should be focusing on energy price shocks and overall inflation, Philipson added. \"That's impacting everyday Americans.\" To that end, the Federal Reserve is making aggressive moves to temper surging inflation, but \"it will take a while for it to work its way through,\" he said.\n\n\"Powell is raising the federal funds rate, and he's leaving himself open to raise it again in September,\" said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, an economics professor at George Washington University and former chief economist at the Labor Department. \"He's saying all the right things.\" However, consumers \"are paying more for gas and food so they have to cut back on other spending,\" Furchtgott-Roth said. \"Negative news continues to mount up,\" she added. \"We are definitely in a recession.\"\n\nWhat comes next: 'The path to a soft landing'\n\nThe direction of the labor market will be key in determining the future state of the economy, both experts said. Decreases in consumption come first, Philipson noted. \"If businesses can't sell as much as they used to because consumers aren't buying as much, then they lay off workers.\"\n\nOn the upside, \"we have twice the number of job openings as unemployed people so employers are not going to be so quick to lay people off,\" according to Furchtgott-Roth. \"That's the path to a soft landing,\" she said.\n\n3 ways to prepare your finances for a recession",

        "text": "Analysts generally expect state-owned enterprises will perform better than non-state-owned developers in the latest real estate slump. Pictured here in Guangxi, China, on Aug. 15, 2022, is a real estate complex developed by state-owned conglomerate Poly Group. Future Publishing | Future Publishing | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Chinese property developers' cash flows \u2014 a sign of the companies' ability to stay afloat \u2014 shrank this year after steady growth over the last decade, according to Oxford Economics. Developer cash flows through July are down 24% year-on-year on an annualized basis, according to analysis from the firm's lead economist, Tommy Wu. That's a sharp slowdown from growth for nearly every year since at least 2009, the data showed. Total funding as of July was 15.22 trillion yuan ($2.27 trillion) on an annualized basis, versus 20.11 trillion yuan in 2021. The drop comes as credit demand in China missed expectations in July, and property developers' struggles drag on. About two years ago, Beijing started to crack down on developers' high reliance on debt for growth. Notably, Evergrande defaulted late last year. Other developers like Shimao have also defaulted, despite appearing to have healthier balance sheets.\n\nWhile investors have turned cautious on Chinese property companies, developers now face the risk of losing another important source of cash flow: homebuyer pre-payments.\n\nHomes are typically sold ahead of completion in China. But since late June, some homebuyers have protested apartment construction delays by halting mortgage payments. \"The crux of the problem is that property developers have insufficient cash flows \u2013 whether because of debt-servicing costs, low housing sales, or misuse of funds \u2013 to continue with projects,\" Wu said in a report last week. \"Resolving this problem will rebuild homebuyers' confidence in developers, which will help support housing sales and, in turn, improve developers' financial health.\" More than $2 billion in high-yield property developer debt is due in September \u2014 that's more than two times that of August, according to Morgan Stanley's analysis as of Aug. 10. About a quarter of homebuyers who bought property ahead of their completion are inclined to stop their mortgage payments if construction is suspended, the U.S. investment bank said in an Aug. 15 report, citing a proprietary AlphaWise Consumer Survey. Not only does real estate account for the bulk of household wealth in China, but analysts estimate property and industries related to real estate account for more than a quarter of China's GDP. The real estate slump has contributed to an overall slowdown in economic growth this year.\n\nIn an effort to support growth, the People's Bank of China has cut rates, including an unexpected cut on Monday of 10 basis points to some one-year interest rates for institutions, known as the medium-term lending facility. While the PBOC may hope the cut could ease some of homebuyers' burden and help developers get loans, the problem isn't just about funding, said Bruce Pang, chief economist and head of research for Greater China at JLL. He noted how developers have found it harder to obtain funding on their own, and have had to rely more on pre-sales to homebuyers. But people are increasingly cautious about buying new homes due to their expectations for future employment and returns on existing investment products, he added. Despite multiple reports of government plans to keep developers funded, the central government has yet to officially announce broader support for real estate. A readout of a high-level government meeting last month said local governments are responsible for delivering completed houses. Among three major sources of developer funding, advance payments and deposits have fallen the most this year, down by 34%, according to Wu's analysis. Credit as a source of funding dropped by 22%, while self-raised capital, including stocks and bonds, was down by 17%, the annualized data showed.\n\nInvestors turn away from China property\n\nInvestment funds have largely stayed away from Chinese property developers, reducing a potential source of funding. \"What has been worrying has been the lack of willingness and speed by top policymakers in resolving real estate developer's funding issues,\" Carol Lye, assistant portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, said in an emailed response to CNBC. Lye said the investment management firm's allocation to China real estate is low, and that Brandywine holds \"high quality real estate bonds that have been given preference in terms of government support.\" Some investors have even turned to companies in other parts of Asia. \"We've exited almost all of our holdings in China residential. It's more a wait-and-see game in terms of getting back exposure,\" said Xin Yan Low, Singapore-based portfolio manager for Asia property equities at Janus Henderson. She declined to share a timeframe of those sales. \"There are still many alternatives in the region, especially with reopening now, Singapore, Australia, basically back to full reopening, fundamentals are strong,\" she said. Top holdings in her co-managed Horizon Asia-Pacific Property Income Fund include Japan Metropolitan Fund Invest, Mapletree Logistics Trust and Hang Lung Properties.\n\nRead more about China from CNBC Pro JPMorgan says buy this undervalued Chinese biopharma stock that can rally more than 40% from here",

Olivier Douliery | AFP | Getty Images\n\nYou'd be hard-pressed now to find a recession in the rearview mirror. What's down the road, though, is another story. There is no historical precedent to indicate that an economy in recession can produce 528,000 jobs in a month, as the U.S. did during July. A 3.5% unemployment rate, tied for the lowest since 1969, is not consistent with contraction. But that doesn't mean there isn't a recession ahead, and, ironically enough, it is the labor market's phenomenal resiliency that could pose the broader economy's biggest long-run danger. The Federal Reserve is trying to ease pressures on a historically tight jobs situation and its rapid wage gains in an effort to control inflation running at its highest level in more than 40 years.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is this gives the Fed additional room to continue to tighten, even if it raises the probability of pushing the economy into recession,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \"It's not going to be an easy task to continue to tighten without negative repercussions for the consumer and the economy.\" Indeed, following the robust job numbers, which included a 5.2% 12-month gain for average hourly earnings, traders accelerated their bets on a more aggressive Fed. As of Friday afternoon, markets were assigning about a 69% chance of the central bank enacting its third straight 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike when it meets again in September, according to CME Group data. So while President Joe Biden celebrated the big jobs number on Friday, a much more unpleasant data point could be on the way next week. The consumer price index, the most widely followed inflation measure, comes out Wednesday, and it's expected to show continued upward pressure even with a sharp drop in gasoline prices in July. That will complicate the central bank's balancing act of using rate increases to temper inflation without tipping the economy into recession. As Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at asset management giant BlackRock, said, the challenge is \"how to execute a 'soft landing' when the economy is coming in hot, and is landing on a runway it has never used before.\" \"Today's print, coming in much stronger than anticipated, complicates the job of a Federal Reserve that seeks to engineer a more temperate employment environment, in keeping with its attempts to moderate current levels of inflation,\" Rieder said in a client note. \"The question though now is how much longer (and higher) will rates have to go before inflation can be brought under control?\"\n\nMore recession signs\n\nFinancial markets were betting against the Fed in other ways. The 2-year Treasury note yield exceeded that of the 10-year note by the highest margin in about 22 years Friday afternoon. That phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, has been a telltale recession sign particularly when it goes on for an extended period of time. In the present case, the inversion has been in place since early July. But that doesn't mean a recession is imminent, only that one is likely over the next year or two. While that means the central bank has some time on its side, it also could mean it won't have the luxury of slow hikes but rather will have to continue to move quickly \u2014 a situation that policymakers had hoped to avoid. \"This is certainly not my base case, but I think that we may start to hear some chatter of an inter-meeting hike, but only if the next batch of inflation reports is hot,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.",

        "text": "Samantha Hawkins had a clear vision for her first home: the 29-year-old from Austin, Texas, wanted a detached house surrounded by a yard for her dog, a garden and a stable space where she could put down roots.\n\nBy January, when she bid $230,000 on a tiny, yardless condo converted from a rental studio, she had \u201cbent on a lot of the things I valued\u201d. She found herself beaten by investors willing to pay cash far above the listing price, and buy sight unseen in gameshow-like bidding wars.\n\nThe 496-sq-ft condo was one of the very few Austin homes she could still afford as prices soared in January. Her offer put her among the finalists, but at the last minute, the seller threw a new curveball: the other bidders had signed an appraisal waiver. Hawkins needed more cash she didn\u2019t have, so she \u201cbowed out\u201d.\n\nAcross the US, many have faced similar roadblocks: prices popped as a confluence of forces suppressed supply and inflated demand, leaving many middle- and lower-income buyers with a dwindling number of housing options, or forcing them into rentership.\n\nSamantha Hawkins at her apartment in Austin. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\nNow, with interest rates rising and the housing market cooling, things are supposed to be different. So far they aren\u2019t. Nationally, house prices hit an all-time high in June of $416,000, up 13.4% from a year ago.\n\nThe challenges Austin buyers are still experiencing show just how difficult the dream of owning your own home has become for a broad swath of Americans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked really hard the last year or two and made the right choices financially to try to have a chance, but it seems like I can\u2019t really win in this market,\u201d Hawkins said.\n\nThe problems plaguing tight markets nationally have all hit Austin. Hawkins is competing with investors who now account for more than 30% of single-family home sales, Airbnb operators and any number of the about 125 people moving to Austin daily amid dizzying job growth. Meanwhile, builders haven\u2019t kept pace with demand and zoning laws limit new multifamily housing that could provide relief.\n\nMay\u2019s median sale prices in Austin and surrounding Travis county hit new peaks of $676,000 and $625,000, respectively \u2013 up from around $400,000 just before the pandemic. That\u2019s put pressure on the rental market, pushing the median rent above $2,700 and fueling displacement.\n\nAnd even though Austin\u2019s June home inventory doubled over the prior year as interest rate hikes cooled demand, supply is only increasing for the wealthiest buyers.\n\nThe portion of national listings that someone earning $75,000 annually could afford dropped from 40% to 25% between January and June as home prices and mortgage rates climbed, National Association of Realtors\u2019 (NAR) data shows.\n\n\u201cThe higher inventory is promising, but not for middle- and lower-income groups,\u201d said Nadia Evangelou, an economist with NAR.\n\nThere\u2019s some evidence of that on the ground. Austin realtor Sherry LeBlanc, who focuses on finding homes for first-time buyers, recently listed a house that could have fetched $515,000 last year for $435,000 with the expectation that middle-income buyers would snap it up. Instead, showings were slow and only investors bid.\n\n\u201cFamilies are scared off by interest rates,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say, \u2018Well, shit, that\u2019s out of my budget.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor those like Hawkins stuck in rentership, the crisis hits on a financial level. Homeownership is a key instrument for wealth building and security, and loss of access to it represents a \u201cbreach of the social contract\u201d, said Austin realtor Socar Chatmon-Thomas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pissing me off because somebody who went to school, got a degree, or otherwise did everything right and now has a job making $60,000 can\u2019t buy a home,\u201d she said.\n\nInvestor demand\n\nEven with a six-figure tech salary, Courtney McKinley couldn\u2019t buy in the city. The parks, restaurants, pools and friends that attracted her to a rental in Austin\u2019s Zilker neighborhood were off the table as the lowest house prices had inched toward $1m.\n\nBut even as she looked around the city\u2019s edge and suburbs, she couldn\u2019t top the cash offers. A $350,000 bid on an over 40-year-old townhouse that \u201cneeded some help\u201d was beaten by an investor who offered $50,000 more in cash. Weeks later, she lost on a dilapidated townhome despite including a $50,000 escalation clause. The next month, an offer $30,000 over asking price on a sun-filled, three-bedroom home that felt perfect was turned down. \u201cThat was a heartbreak moment. I cried after that one,\u201d McKinley said.\n\nAfter more dead ends, she finally won with a $400,000 bid for a two-bedroom that needed a new kitchen, patio, floors and other improvements. It\u2019s in Pflugerville, a sprawling suburb of strip malls and big box stores that\u2019s in a \u201ckind of isolating\u201d location, McKinley said. Ultimately, however, she says she feels lucky: friends have put in up to 15 offers and still don\u2019t have a house.\n\nA new housing development under construction in Pflugerville, Texas. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\n\u201cIt was a rollercoaster, but no matter how difficult and frustrating it was, at least I\u2019m building equity now,\u201d she said.\n\nFor middle-class Austinites like McKinley being outbid by cash offers in Austin, this much feels clear: investors are part of the problem.\n\nWhile some argue the percentage of investor-owned single family purchases nationally remains low, tight \u201csun belt\u201d markets like metro Austin have seen it double from about 15% throughout the mid-2010s to over 30% in 2022\u2019s first quarter. And investors often target the type of homes that middle-income earners like McKinley are seeking, as well as those in lower-income, minority neighborhoods\n\n\u201cInvestors are not focused on the higher end of the market,\u201d said Georgia Tech urban planning professor Elora Lee Raymond. \u201cIt\u2019s entry-level homes that are being snapped up and are incredibly difficult to purchase at this time.\u201d\n\nBeyond having the resources to place higher bids and pay with cash, investors often buy homes sight unseen, and typically skip appraisals and inspections. Some companies also use algorithms to place bids within hours of homes being listed, and Wall Street-backed institutional investors are viewed as particularly problematic.\n\nThe five largest private equity buyers added 76,000 homes to their portfolio between March 2018 and September 2021, and their model has been derided by critics as \u201cindustrial housing\u201d as they maximize profits by raising rents and skimping on maintenance.\n\nA June US House committee investigation highlighting private equity\u2019s role in local housing crises noted corporate landlords in Atlanta were up to 205 times more likely to evict tenants, and increased rents by an average of 37-57% within a year of purchasing properties.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s virtually impossible to quantify how much investors are pushing up home prices, and the situation is a \u201cchicken and egg\u201d question, said Thom Malone, an economist for real estate data analyst CoreLogic.\n\nA new home, right, towers over residences on the same street in the Montopolis neighborhood in south-east Austin. Photograph: Jordan Vonderhaar/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n\u201cWhere investors go, prices go up, but to what extent is this because the prices were going up because demand increased?\u201d Malone asked. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a bit of both.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, another breed of investor is depleting stock in tourist-friendly areas: short-term rental operators. Though the city says Airbnb owners operate about 3,000 units, housing advocate Inside Airbnb gleaned the company\u2019s listings and found about 12,000, including 10,000 whole home units. And that accounts for one company \u2013 the true number of short-term rentals is probably much higher.\n\nIn one east Austin neighborhood, Airbnb in June controlled about 12% of the housing units, Inside Airbnb found. While about 270 units were available for long-term rent during a 2020 US census survey, more than 1,300 whole home units were available on Airbnb in June.\n\n\u201cEven without some economic researcher looking into it, common sense tells you that these are entire apartments that are no longer available, and people will be directly or indirectly displaced,\u201d said Inside Airbnb founder Murray Cox.\n\nShort supply\n\nThe signs of a construction boom are evident across Travis county, the fifth-most populous county in Texas. Along the metro region\u2019s edges, new neighborhoods and strip malls are multiplying, while closer to the city core in south Austin, expensive new condo buildings have sprouted among the old restaurants, strip malls and pawn shops on Congress Avenue.\n\nCars sit parked outside Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory on the east side of Austin. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\nThough Austin has grown at an exceptional clip for decades, the recent population spike is partly driven by tech: Oracle, Tesla, Meta, HP Enterprise and many more have relocated or opened offices here. That\u2019s coupled with demand from New York and California buyers who relocated during the pandemic, and millennials entering the market.\n\nMonthly new construction home closures in Austin in 2021 were up by 53% from pre-pandemic highs, CoreLogic data shows, but the city is struggling to build its way out of the crisis: supply chain squeezes and labor shortages observers pin on Trump\u2019s immigration policies have slowed the construction cycle.\n\n\u201cSupply is a tortoise and demand is a gazelle, so when there\u2019s a sudden increase in demand, it takes years for new supply to come on the market, and in the meantime there\u2019s this huge surge in prices,\u201d said Jake Wegmann, a University of Texas regional planning professor.\n\nA recent proposal to overhaul Austin\u2019s zoning ordinance would have allowed for more apartment buildings, increased the number of townhomes and simplified the approval process. The changes would allow the city to build \u201cthousands more units\u201d annually, but Nimby-ism and anti-growth forces shut it down, Wegmann said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to make it sound like this would\u2019ve solved everything, but we\u2019re really tying our own hand behind our back,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2018I pray every night\u2019\n\nPaola Valdez-Lopez cleans while her kids, Alycia, five, and Matias, six, eat dinner in Austin. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\nSoaring home prices ultimately create pressure lower in the market, hitting the city\u2019s most vulnerable the hardest. Six months ago, Paola Valdez and her husband made the last $500 payment on their three-bedroom trailer set in a south Austin mobile home park. The extra money was welcome as the couple raised two young kids, and they were proud to own the home outright.\n\nBut everything changed in early July. The California investor who recently purchased the Congress Mobile Home Park handed 60-day eviction notices to its residents, and leaving isn\u2019t easy \u2013 Valdez\u2019s trailer can\u2019t be transported because it\u2019s 30 years old.\n\nA new, smaller trailer is $1,500 a month plus the lot fee, and three-bedroom apartments in her neighborhood top $3,500 a month. The family is at a loss over what it will do next, but Valdez expects her days of staying home to raise the kids are done.\n\n\u201cOne day you\u2019re fine, you\u2019ve paid off your home and you\u2019re making a nest, then all the sudden you\u2019re bombarded with \u2018You\u2019ve got to leave in 60 days\u2019,\u201d Valdez said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to stay strong. I pray every night.\u201d\n\nLeft: A notice of non-renewal of lease for Paola Valdez-Lopez. Right: Edvin Agular embraces his wife, Valdez-Lopez. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\nAs median rent jumped 48% year over year, state records analyzed by the Guardian data show Travis County evictions hit record monthly highs in March and April. That\u2019s partially fueled by investors purchasing apartment buildings with affordable rents and turning them into pricey condos, said Mincho Jacob, a spokesperson with housing advocate Basta Austin.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s destroying the heart of Austin because people with long roots here are evicted and forced out,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are few tools to do anything about it in Texas where the Republican-controlled legislature largely banned rent control, and though housing advocates have had some success in warding off developer purchases of affordable housing, it hasn\u2019t been enough. Similarly, wide-scale displacement continues even though Austin voters since 2018 have approved $550m for affordable housing and anti-displacement measures.\n\nAnother link between the higher home prices and rental pressure is those like Hawkins, who have been shut out of ownership. But with a recent salary increase in her career, she\u2019s regrouping and saving money, and says she\u2019s determined as ever to own.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a goal of mine for a really long time, and since there\u2019s been so many failed attempts, I just want to prove to myself that I can do it,\u201d she said.",

As it turns out, the millions of dollars and years of frustration meant that when Estonia and Finland agreed in April to share the cost of renting an L.N.G. processing vessel and build floating terminals, the preliminary research and development was already done.\n\nIn the months leading up to Russia\u2019s invasion, Mr. Haal said, soaring gas prices had already begun to change the economics of investing in an L.N.G. terminal. Now, his major concern is ensuring that the Estonian government completes the pipeline connection to the national gas network on time.\n\nOver the years, the question of building more L.N.G. facilities \u2014 in addition to the two dozen or so already in Europe \u2014 has been repeatedly debated in ports and capitals. Opponents argued that shipping the chilled, liquefied natural gas was much more expensive than the flow from Russia. The required new infrastructure of port terminals and pipes aroused local opposition. And there was resistance to investing so much money in a fossil fuel that climate agreements had eventually targeted for extinction.\n\nOne of the countries saying no was Europe\u2019s largest economy, Germany, which was getting 55 percent of its gas from Russia.\n\n\u201cThe general overview was that Europe had more L.N.G. capacity than it needs,\u201d said Nina Howell, a partner at the law firm King and Spalding. After the invasion, projects that had not been considered commercially viable, \u201cand probably wouldn\u2019t have made it, then suddenly got government support.\u201d",

        "text": "Consumer confidence in the UK is weaker than during the four major recessions of the past half century as rapidly rising inflation saps morale.\n\nAlthough the UK is technically yet to enter recession, the latest barometer of sentiment from the data company GfK found the public gloomier than at any time since the survey began in January 1974.\n\nThe monthly look at confidence found the relatively upbeat mood as Britain emerged from lockdown in 2021 had been replaced by deepening pessimism as the annual increase in the cost of living has climbed to a 40-year high of 10.1%.\n\nIn grim news for businesses that rely on consumer spending, the public mood is now more downbeat than it was during the recessions of the mid-1970s, the early 1980s, the early 1990s and the late 2000s.\n\nThe period covered by the survey also covers the three-day week of 1974, the sterling crisis of 1976, and the pound\u2019s ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992 \u2013 none of which was marked by such a bleak public mood.\n\nSentiment has been falling steadily throughout 2022 and dropped by a further three points to a record low of -44 in August. A year ago the index stood at -8.\n\nConsumers are pessimistic about the outlook for their own finances in the year ahead (-31) as a further sharp increase in the energy price cap looms in October, but even more pessimistic (-60) about the prospects for the economy.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our sub-measure on the general economy over the past year has decreased month-on-month since December 2021.\u201d\n\nStaton said there had been a similar consistent marked decline since the end of last year in how consumers viewed the economy, with the August score of -60 a new record.\n\n\u201cThese findings point to a sense of capitulation, of financial events moving far beyond the control of ordinary people. With headline after headline revealing record inflation eroding household buying power, the strain on the personal finances of many in the UK is alarming. Just making ends meet has become a nightmare and the crisis of confidence will only worsen with the darkening days of autumn and the colder months of winter.\u201d\n\nThe latest flash estimates of consumer spending released on Thursday by the Office for National Statistics showed restaurant numbers did not change in the week to 14 August, while payments by credit and debit cards decreased by seven percentage points.\n\nLinda Ellett, UK head of consumer markets, retail and leisure at KPMG, said: \u201cStorm clouds are now fast closing in, with higher costs reducing the discretionary spending power of even more households this autumn and winter.\n\n\u201cSo far this year, retail sales have somewhat defied the very low levels of consumer confidence. But a widespread reduction in spending ability will lead to drops in demand and changing buying behaviour, both of which will impact the high street and wider economy.\u201d",

Market pricing is for a half-point rate hike at the September meeting, though that remains a close call.\n\nMeeting participants noted that the 2.25%-2.50% range for the federal funds rate was around the \"neutral\" level that is neither supportive nor restrictive on activity. Some officials said a restrictive stance likely will be appropriate, indicating more rate hikes to come.\n\n\"With inflation remaining well above the Committee's objective, participants judged that moving to a restrictive stance of policy was required to meet the Committee's legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability,\" the minutes said.\n\nThe document also reflected the idea that once the Fed gets comfortable with its policy stance and sees it having an impact on inflation, it could start to take its foot off the policy brake. That notion has helped push stocks into a strong summer rally.\n\n\"Participants judged that, as the stance of monetary policy tightened further, it likely would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjustments on economic activity and inflation,\" the minutes said.\n\nHowever, the summary also stated that some participants said \"it likely would be appropriate to maintain that level for some time to ensure that inflation was firmly on a path back to 2 percent.\"",

        "text": "\u201cOn the surface, this is good news for the Fed,\u201d said Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights. \u201cThis is the first baby step toward the moderation they want to see on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nInflation F.A.Q. Card 1 of 5 Inflation F.A.Q. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. Inflation F.A.Q. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Inflation F.A.Q. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. Inflation F.A.Q. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Inflation F.A.Q. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFed officials remain committed to wrestling America\u2019s rapid inflation lower, and they have raised interest rates at the quickest pace since the 1980s to try to slow the economy and bring supply and demand into balance \u2014 making supersize rate moves of three-quarters of a percentage point at each of their past two meetings. Another big adjustment will be up for debate at their next meeting in September, policymakers have said.\n\nBut investors interpreted July\u2019s unexpectedly pronounced inflation slowdown as a sign that policymakers could take a gentler route, raising rates a half-point next month. Stocks soared more than 2 percent on Wednesday, as Wall Street bet that the Fed might become less aggressive, which would decrease the chances that it would plunge the economy into a recession.\n\n\u201cIt was as good as the markets and the Fed could have hoped for from this report,\u201d said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies. \u201cI do think it removes the urgency for the Fed.\u201d\n\nStill, officials who spoke on Wednesday remained cautious about inflation. Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, called the report the \u201cfirst hint\u201d of a move in the right direction, while Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that it was \u201cpositive\u201d but that price increases remained \u201cunacceptably high.\u201d\n\nPolicymakers have been hoping for more than a year that price increases will begin to cool, only to have those expectations repeatedly dashed. Supply chain issues have made goods more expensive, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sent commodity prices soaring, a shortage of workers pushed wages and service prices higher and a dearth of housing has fueled rising rents.",

        "text": "Hiring in July was far better than expected, defying multiple other signs that the economic recovery is losing steam, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.\n\nNonfarm payrolls rose 528,000 for the month and the unemployment rate was 3.5%, easily topping the Dow Jones estimates of 258,000 and 3.6%, respectively. The unemployment rate is now back to its pre-pandemic level and tied for the lowest since 1969, though the rate for Blacks rose 0.2 percentage point to 6%.\n\nWage growth also surged higher, as average hourly earnings jumped 0.5% for the month and 5.2% from the same time a year ago. Those numbers add fuel to an inflation picture that already has consumer prices rising at their fastest rate since the early 1980s. The Dow Jones estimate was for a 0.3% monthly gain and 4.9% annual increase.\n\nMore broadly, though, the report showed the labor market remains strong despite other signs of economic weakness.\n\n\"There's no way to take the other side of this. There's not a lot of, 'Yeah, but,' other than it's not positive from a market or Fed perspective,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. \"For the economy, this is good news.\"\n\nMarkets initially reacted negatively to the report as traders anticipated a strong counter move from a Federal Reserve looking to cool the economy and in particular a heated labor market. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day positive, rising about 74 points following a day of choppy trading.\n\nLeisure and hospitality led the way in job gains with 96,000, though the industry is still 1.2 million workers shy of its pre-pandemic level.\n\nProfessional and business services was next with 89,000. Health care added 70,000 and government payrolls grew 57,000. Goods-producing industries also posted solid gains, with construction up 32,000 and manufacturing adding 30,000.\n\nRetail jobs increased by 22,000, despite repeated warnings from executives at Walmart, Target and elsewhere that consumer demand is shifting.\n\nA more encompassing view of unemployment that includes those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons as well as discouraged workers not looking for jobs was unchanged at 6.7%.",

        "text": "A year ago, buying a Starbucks coffee didn\u2019t feel \u201creal\u201d to Samantha Thomas. \u201cIt was just tapping,\u201d the 41-year-old private tutor from Wigan says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like real money, it was just my card.\u201d Nowadays, Thomas pulls out a \u00a35 note every time she wants a hot drink. \u201cWhen you\u2019re physically handing over solid money,\u201d she says, \u201cit just makes you think twice.\u201d\n\nFor the last 12 months, Thomas has been a cash-only consumer. She leaves her debit card at home when she does her weekly food shop, bringing only the budget she has allocated in notes. As a result, Thomas could \u201csit here and tell you to the penny\u201d what most items in the supermarket cost. \u201cI know that if I go to Aldi something would cost me 6p less than if I went to Asda and about 5p less than if I went to Tesco,\u201d she says. Thomas\u2019s \u201csolid money\u201d habit hasn\u2019t just changed her attitude to Starbucks; it\u2019s changed the way she spends and saves entirely.\n\nResearch shows that we experience the \u2018pain of paying\u2019 when spending cash. Photograph: georgeclerk/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nThomas is not the only one turning to cash during the cost of living crisis. In July, more than \u00a3800m in banknotes was withdrawn from Post Office counters, a 20% rise from the same month the year before. Martin Kearsley, banking director at the Post Office, told the BBC: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more people increasingly reliant on cash as the tried-and-tested way to manage a budget.\u201d\n\nSince records began five years ago, Post Office withdrawals have exceeded \u00a3800m only once before \u2013 and that was last Christmas, a time when a lot of cash is tucked into cards. Shortly after UK wages fell at their fastest rate in 20 years, Kearsley said it was clear that Britain is \u201canything but a cashless society\u201d.\n\nThomas first ditched her debit card post-lockdown after she was troubled by her online spending during the pandemic, but she says her cash-only budget is helping her to prepare for rising costs. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m ahead of the game, I feel like I\u2019ve got an advantage,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be tricky, but I feel like I\u2019ve already got lots of tools in place to help me.\u201d\n\nContactless promotes increased spending and increased use of debt Warwick business school\n\nPersonal finance and consumer expert Sue Hayward concurs that \u201chanding over cold hard cash often makes you think twice about how much you\u2019re spending\u201d. She also notes that it\u2019s easier to keep track of purchases when paying with banknotes, \u201cas contactless payments can take several days to show up on your statement\u201d.\n\nIn 2020, researchers from Warwick business school analysed more than 300m transactions from 260,000 consumers and found that people with contactless cards spent \u201csignificantly more\u201d than those without. Contactless spenders were also more likely to be charged overdraft fees and made more purchases overall. The researchers concluded that contactless: \u201cpromotes increased spending and can promote decreased cash usage and increased use of debt.\u201d\n\nConversely, almost 30 years of academic research have shown that we experience the \u201cpain of paying\u201d when spending cash: handing over money feels like losing it, activating the insular cortex, the part of our brain that deals with physical pain. (Interestingly, it seems that some alternatives to cash are less painful than others. One 2018 paper, from the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, found that consumers feel lower levels of pain when they pay with mobile phones and smartwatches than when they use credit cards.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just being savvy and going back to old-school ways,\u201d Thomas says of her cash use. On her YouTube channel, The Budget Mum UK, she shows her 2,600 subscribers how she withdraws her wage at the start of the month and separates the notes into different laminated envelopes. Among others, there\u2019s an envelope for food shopping, one for travel, one for credit card debt and one for emergencies.\n\nOld-style budgeting \u2026 \u2018cash stuffing\u2019 involves setting aside money in envelopes, one for each expense. Photograph: FotoDuets/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nOn social media, this budgeting technique is called \u201ccash stuffing\u201d: the envelopes help people keep track of their spending and saving without complicated spreadsheets. Google searches for the technique spiked at the beginning of the year, and TikTok videos hashtagged #cashstuffing have now accumulated almost 550m views.\n\nJade Edmondson is a 29-year-old teaching assistant from Coventry who sells cash-stuffing materials such as labelled plastic envelopes, binders and savings tracking sheets on her Etsy page. She says she has seen a recent rise in sales. In total, Edmondson personally uses 30 cash-stuffing envelopes for things such as petrol money, Christmas savings and her Slimming World membership. Putting away money gradually in one envelope over the course of the year helps Edmondson save for bigger costs: she now has \u00a3350 saved to buy her four children\u2019s school uniforms. \u201cIf this was me last year, I would be panicking: \u2018How am I going to pay for all of this?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cWhereas actually now, I don\u2019t worry about money.\u201d\n\nYet a cash-only lifestyle can cause problems in an increasingly cashless society. In 2010, half of the UK\u2019s transactional payments were made in cash, but by 2020, this had dropped to just 17%. A number of shops banned cash payments for public health reasons during the pandemic, but a 2021 survey by Which? found that one in five consumers had been prevented from making a cash payment between April and July of 2021, when restrictions were easing.\n\nThe reality is you will pay more using cash because you can\u2019t shop online Natalie Cenney\n\nThomas has run into trouble when paying for petrol \u2013 and when she sent her daughter to the cinema with cash recently, she was unable to buy her ticket and snacks. \u201cIt\u2019s just been trial and error,\u201d she says. Six weeks ago, she decided to set up Apple Pay on her phone as a backup for emergencies, but she refuses to leave her credit card in her car to avoid temptation.\n\nNatalie Ceeney, chair of the Cash Action Group, says many small businesses don\u2019t accept cash because it\u2019s increasingly difficult to deposit takings due to the closure of high street banks. Ceeney is now campaigning to get ATMs to take cash deposits (you can currently do this inside banks, but opening hours can be prohibitive). However, she says, \u201csetting up a whole new network\u201d is \u201cnot quick\u201d. Meanwhile, Ceeney notes that many consumers depend on cash due to \u201csome form of vulnerability\u201d, such as not having a proper internet connection, smartphone or bank account, or having a disability. A May study by the Royal Society of Arts found that 15 million people in the UK rely on cash to budget.\n\n\u201cThe main reason people will tell you they use cash is for budgeting: you can see it, you can feel it,\u201d Ceeney says. \u201cWith the cost of living crisis, more people are strapped for cash so it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that people are going back to using cash, withdrawing money to get through the week safely without getting overdrawn.\u201d\n\nAlthough cash can have its advantages, Ceeney warns that there\u2019s a \u201cpoverty premium\u201d when avoiding cards. \u201cThe reality is, if you can\u2019t shop online you will pay more using cash because you can\u2019t get online deals or direct debits where you often get a discount, you can\u2019t shop around or buy in bulk,\u201d she says. Ceeney explains that although many families know this, they\u2019re \u201cgoing back to cash because they can\u2019t afford to go overdrawn \u2013 this is about necessity\u201d.\n\nEven with cash-stuffing systems in place, Thomas and Edmondson are concerned about the ever-increasing cost of living. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s going to be a big hurdle,\u201d Thomas says of rising bills, while Edmondson adds: \u201cIt\u2019s still very nerve-racking. It\u2019s like: \u2018Where are we going to find this extra money from?\u2019\u201d While using cash can be helpful for individual consumers, it is not a substitute for government intervention, nor a long-term solution to our economic crisis. With food prices rising at their fastest pace in 14 years and annual energy bills expected to cost two months\u2019 worth of wages next year, coins can only go so far.\n\nAdditional reporting by Rachel Hall",

        "text": "Check out the companies making the biggest moves midday:\n\nTarget \u2014 Shares of the retailer slid more than 2% after its earnings missed Wall Street expectations by a wide margin. The company said its quarterly profit fell almost 90% from a year ago. However, Target reiterated its full-year forecast and said it is now positioned for a rebound.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond \u2014 Shares of the meme stock jumped about 12% on Wednesday, continuing a torrid August rally for the challenged retailer. The stock has seen abnormally high trading volume and is the most popular topic on Reddit page WallStreetBets.\n\nKrispy Kreme \u2014 The doughnut chain slid 12% after it reported quarterly results that included lower-than-expected profit and revenue. The company also said it has seen significant deceleration in commodity costs in recent weeks.\n\nWeber \u2014 Shares of the grill maker dropped more than 7% after Citi downgraded Weber to sell from neutral. The company's weak sales outlook and dwindling cash on hand means that Weber may have to raise additional capital, Citi said.\n\nTeladoc Health \u2014 Shares of Teladoc slipped almost 9% after Guggenheim downgraded the company to sell from neutral. The firm said Teladoc's pace of growth is set to slow in a challenging macroeconomic environment with a weakening consumer.\n\nSanofi \u2014 The French drugmaker hit a 52-week low, with its U.S.-traded shares dropping almost 6%.

Unity shares were also down nearly 3%.\n\nTake-Two Interactive \u2014 Shares of the software company fell almost 3% after being downgraded by Deutsche Bank to hold from buy. Analysts cited a balanced risk/reward outlook this year and a lack of material near-term catalysts over the next few quarters. However, Deutsche Bank remains constructive on Take-Two Interactive's long-term growth outlook.\n\nAnalog Devices \u2014 Shares dropped almost 5% after CEO Vincent Roche said \"economic uncertainty is beginning to impact bookings\" at the semiconductor company.

Aviation experts said they expect prices to continue to drop into the fall as jet fuel prices and demand ease.\n\nFares peaked in May when many travelers began confirming summer travel plans. After more than two years of exercising caution, many people took longer trips this summer, which is typically the busiest season for air travel. At the same time, many airlines cut the number of flights on their summer schedules to reduce the risk of mass delays and cancellations because of weather and staffing problems especially around holidays and other peak travel days. Fares were also driven up by high labor and fuel costs.",

        "text": "LONDON \u2014 The average cost of a pint of beer in the U.K. has soared by 70% since 2008 \u2014 well ahead of inflation \u2014 and some Londoners are parting with as much as \u00a38 ($9.70) for 568ml of the amber nectar. According to figures from consultancy firm CGA, the average cost of a pint has risen from \u00a32.30 in 2008 to \u00a33.95 in 2022, though prices vary drastically across locations. Average prices rose by 15 pence between 2021 and 2022, up almost 4%, one of the largest year-on-year increases since 2008. The average price of a pint at one unnamed pub in London hit an eye-watering \u00a38.06 this year, the highest CGA has ever recorded, while the lowest nationally was a \u00a31.79 average at a pub in Lancashire, in the northwest of England. U.K. inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.4% in June and is expected to rise beyond 13% in October, compounding the country's historic cost-of-living crisis and prompting the Bank of England to implement its largest interest rate hike since 1995 on Thursday. Many pubs and hospitality venues are concerned that consumers will increasingly stay at home. Paul Bolton, client director for GB drinks at CGA, told CNBC that a combination of supply chain issues, staffing shortages, soaring energy costs, lingering pandemic-era debts and generally high inflation are increasing suppliers' cost pressures, which then have to be passed onto the consumer. Raw materials and energy Francois Sonneville, senior beverage analyst at Rabobank, told CNBC that prices are increasing throughout the value chain, starting with barley. \"The barley price has gone up, and has doubled since 2021. There's two reasons for that: one is that the harvest in North America was really poor, driven by a poor climate, so there was not much inventory to start with \u2013 and then, of course, we had the Black Sea region conflict,\" he told CNBC's Arabile Gumede.\n\nA pint of Adnams Ghost Ship Citrus pale Ale. The Suffolk-based brewer says a combination of soaring energy, labor and raw material costs is squeezing businesses and driving up the price of a pint. Geography Photos/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nHistorically, when grain prices increased, farmers would compensate by planting more the following year, but broader agricultural inflation is also putting a squeeze on farms, outpacing even the 40-year high of 9.4% headline inflation in the U.K. \"Where our normal inflation is running at 8, 9%, (agricultural) inflation for our businesses is running somewhere over 22, 23%,\" explained Richard Hirst, owner of Hirst Farms in Suffolk. \"That's a function of obviously oil prices, fuel \u2013 our tractor diesel has gone up more than three times in price, which is a lot more, relatively, than road fuel has gone up.\" Hirst said the farm is also facing substantial labor cost increases, with shortages affecting the farming industry nationwide, along with fertilizer costs. \"Fertilizer costs will have tripled for next year \u2013 we're buying fertilizer now three times what it was last year. Our chemical inputs are going up and just the cost of running machinery, whether it's spare parts or actually just the cost of buying machinery itself. All that has gone up an awful lot more than the 9 or 10% of normal inflation.\"\n\nHowever, barley is not the main cost incurred during the brewing process \u2013 in fact, it only contributes around 5% of the price of beer at the tap. The biggest costs, analysts and business leaders told CNBC, come from labor, packaging and energy. \"I think that if you look at the brewing process itself, it uses a lot of energy \u2013 and the energy price has gone up, as we all know, when we stop at the pump \u2013 but the most important one is probably packaging,\" Sonneville said. \"Packaging makes up about 25 to 30% of the cost price of beer, and glass packaging, glass bottles, use about 25% of their cost in energy, so with gas prices going 10 times higher now than they were two years ago, that has a massive impact on the cost of a brewer.\" Labor of love His comments were echoed by Andy Wood, CEO of Suffolk-based brewery and hospitality business Adnams, who told CNBC that the energy price increases the company is seeing are \"absolutely eye-watering.\" \"Brewing beer or distilling spirits involves a lot of boiling water, so that involves lots of energy to get to that state, although we've put quite a number of innovations in over the years to limit the impact of that,\" he explained. Wood said in the aftermath of Brexit and the pandemic, a tightening of the U.K. labor market is also exerting upward wage pressure, which will likely be exacerbated by the country's escalating cost-of-living crisis. \"The biggest cost that we have is our payroll because the hospitality part of that business is a people-driven business,\" he added. What's more, the geopolitical headwinds facing businesses throughout the supply chain are unlikely to abate any time soon.\n\n\"So we've got Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we've got the energy crisis that that's brought on, we've got the food supply crisis, grain, cooking oils, these types of things, and then \u2026 we hear in the media that China may be looking longingly at Taiwan, so I think the geopolitical situation is getting no easier, so I think these things are here to stay,\" he said. The question for businesses, according to both Wood and Sonneville, is how many of these costs they can absorb, how much should be passed onto consumers, and in the midst of a cost of living crisis, how to sustain margins without forcing the consumer to stay at home and jeopardizing volumes. Brewers tend to have long-term contracts and hedges in place to ensure contingency plans for future price rises, meaning not all of their costs are fully reflected at present, and therefore not immediately passed onto consumers. \"I think if you look at the price of beer that you and I pay, there is a risk that that will go higher, because there is a lagging effect of costs at the brewery because of those long-term contracts,\" Sonneville said on Monday. \"The hope that I think is there at brewers is that prices will come down. We have not seen that in gas \u2014 we've seen more sanctions there and gas prices have actually risen in the last three days \u2014 but we have seen that grain prices have come off a little bit, and the hope is that that will continue.\" Shifting trends Wood noted that consumer sentiment and behavior had already begun to shift in the face of higher prices at the bar. \"We're certainly seeing people come out earlier in the evening, having their drinks, having their dinner, and then they're going back home,\" he said. \"We're seeing people perhaps having two courses rather than three courses, and perhaps having a glass of wine rather than a bottle of wine, so we are seeing some changes in consumer behavior, there is no doubt about that.\" This was reflected in CGA's latest consumer analysis, which found that premium products and venues offering particularly unique experiences were increasing their share of the on-trade.",

The home improvement retailer saw both revenue and comparable store sales come in below analyst forecasts but predicted full-year earnings would come in at the top end of its guidance range.\n\nTarget (TGT) \u2013 Target fell 3.3% in premarket trading after the retailer reported quarterly earnings of 39 cents per share, well short of the 72-cent consensus estimate. Target's revenue matched estimates, but it cut prices significantly during the quarter to reduce excess inventory. Target said the 1.2% operating margin rate during the second quarter would improve to about 6% in the back half of the year.\n\nTJX (TJX) \u2013 The parent of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls retail chains beat estimates by 3 cents with a quarterly profit of 69 cents per share, but revenue and comparable store sales came in less than expected. TJX cut its full-year forecast as well, saying inflation impacted the spending habits of its customers, and the stock fell 1.2% in the premarket.\n\nKrispy Kreme (DNUT) \u2013 Krispy Kreme tumbled 14.7% in premarket action after the doughnut chain reported lower-than-expected profit and revenue for the second quarter. Krispy Kreme said it is seeing significant deceleration in commodity costs in recent weeks.\n\nManchester United (MANU) \u2013 Manchester United rose 4.6% in the premarket after Elon Musk tweeted that he was buying the British football team and then subsequently said he was joking.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) \u2013 Bed Bath & Beyond surged 22.8% in the pre-market after registering over 20% gains in each of the past three sessions. The retailer's shares \u2013 which have been popular with \"meme stock\" investors, are up in 14 of the past 15 sessions, more than quadrupling in value over that stretch.\n\nAgilent Technologies (A) \u2013 Agilent rallied 6.6% in premarket trading after the life sciences and diagnostics company reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue. Agilent also raised its full-year forecast on strong order flow.\n\nSouthwest Gas (SWX) \u2013 Southwest Gas rose 4.7% in premarket action after investor Carl Icahn raised his stake in the utility company to 8.7% from 7.6%.\n\nSanofi (SNY) \u2013 Sanofi shares slid 5.4% in premarket trading after the French drug maker halted development of breast cancer treatment amcenestrant.

Because we're not just dealing with economic issues like inflation and lapping stimulus and things like that. But also the social issues of people returning to mobility after lockdown, working from home and just the change in consumer patterns.\"\n\nThree months earlier, during the company's prior call with analysts, Gibbs said economists who call this a \"K-shaped recovery,\" where high-income consumers are doing fine while lower-income householders struggle, are oversimplifying the situation.\n\n\"I don't know in my career we've seen a more complex environment to analyze consumer behavior than what we're dealing with right now,\" he said in May, citing inflation, rising wages and federal stimulus spending that's still stoking the economy.\n\nAt the same time, societal issues like the post-Covid reopening and Russia's war in Ukraine are weighing on consumer sentiment, which all \"makes for a pretty complex environment to figure out how to analyze it and market to consumers,\" Gibbs said.\n\nGibbs is right. Things are very strange. Is a recession coming or not?\n\nThere is ample evidence for the \"yes\" camp.\n\nTech and finance are bracing for a downturn with hiring slowdowns and job cuts and pleas for more efficiency from workers. The stock market has been on a nine-month slump with the tech-heavy Nasdaq off more than 20% from its November peak and many high-flying tech stocks down 60% or more.\n\nInflation is causing consumers to spend less on nonessential purchases like clothing so they can afford gas and food. The U.S. economy has contracted for two straight quarters.",

Pictured here is Li at a World Economic Forum virtual event in July 2022.\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has called on six provinces to take the lead in supporting the country's growth after data for July showed a slowdown across the board.\n\nRetail sales, industrial production and fixed asset investment data released Monday missed analysts' expectations and marked a slowdown from June. It comes as China's economy registered growth of just 2.5% in the first half of the year.\n\n\"Now is the most critical juncture for economic rebound,\" Li said at a meeting Tuesday, according to an English-language readout. He called for \"resolute and prompt efforts\" to strengthen the foundation for recovery.\n\nMuch of that responsibility lies with six \"economically strong provinces\" that account for 45% of national GDP, the readout said. It said the six provinces also make up nearly 60% of the national total for trade and foreign investment.\n\nThe leaders of the coastal, export-heavy provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong spoke via video at an economic meeting with Li on Tuesday, the readout said. Leaders of the landlocked provinces of Henan and Sichuan also spoke.\n\nThe province-level municipalities of Shanghai and Beijing were not mentioned.",

Democrats have faced a bleak outlook heading into the fall, with Mr. Biden suffering from dismal approval numbers amid soaring inflation and painful prices at the pump.\n\nMr. Biden is planning to sign a bill on Wednesday that would expand medical care for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits on military bases, another measure that Congress approved with bipartisan support. And on Friday, the House is expected to pass the climate, health and tax bill that cleared the Senate over the weekend, handing the president a legislative triumph that he and Democratic candidates can highlight in the weeks to come.\n\nThe effort to promote the recent series of victories comes after Mr. Biden was forced to isolate during a bout with Covid-19, followed by a rebound case. He left isolation on Sunday and then traveled on Monday to meet with survivors of the severe flooding in Kentucky, his first work trip since testing positive for the virus on July 21.",

        "text": "Initial claims for unemployment insurance totaled 260,000 last week, near the highest level since November amid a shift in the U.S. labor market. The total for the week ended July 30 was in line with the Dow Jones estimate but a gain of 6,000 from the previous week's downwardly revised level, the Labor Department reported Thursday. In other economic news, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services decreased to $79.6 billion in June, down $5.3 billion and slightly lower than the estimate for $80 billion. The jobless claims number comes a day before the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its much anticipated nonfarm payrolls report for July. That is expected the show the U.S. economy added 258,000 positions in the month, compared with the 372,000 initial June estimate and the lowest total since December 2020.\n\nA sign for hire is posted on the window of a Chipotle restaurant in New York, April 29, 2022. Shannon Stapleton | Reuters\n\n\"The labor market remains in good shape as the summer quarter progresses but the rise in initial claims since early April is a cold breeze blowing at the hot labor market this summer,\" said Stuart Hoffman, senior economic advisor at PNC Financial Services. Federal Reserve officials are watching the jobs market closely for clues about an economy that is showing the highest inflation rate in more than 40 years. Jobless claims had been running around their lowest levels since the late 1960s but started ticking higher in June as inflation pressures swelled and companies started cutting back on hires. Even with robust hiring in 2021 and the first half of 2022, the total employment level is 755,000 below where it was in February 2020, the last month before the Covid pandemic hit. The four-week moving average of jobless claims, which smooths out weekly volatility, reflects the shift in the jobs market. That number rose 6,000 from the previous week to 254,750, up sharply from the recent low of 170,500 on April 2 and the highest level of the year. Continuing claims, which run a week behind the headline number, totaled 1.42 million, up 48,000 from the prior week and 83,000 from the beginning of July.\n\nTrade deficit comes off record high",

        "text": "Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading.\n\nWalmart, Home Depot \u2014 The retailers' shares rose about 5% each after both companies reported better-than-expected earnings for the most recent quarter. That lifted other retail stocks, which led market gains. Bath & Body Works jumped 6%. Target and Best Buy each added about 5%. Ross Stores, Lowe's and TJX Companies climbed about 3% each.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond \u2014 The home retailer's shares skyrocketed about 64%. At its highest, shares added more than 70% to touch an intraday high of $28.60 Tuesday amid multiple trading halts due to volatility. The rally came as retail traders active on social media piled into the stock, encouraged by news that GameStop chair Ryan Cohen placed another bet on the struggling retailer.\n\nNu Holdings \u2014 Shares of the Warren Buffett-backed digital banking company surged more than 23% after the firm reported quarterly revenue that rose 230% from a year earlier. Berkshire Hathaway owned $400 million of Nu Holdings shares at the end of the second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter.\n\nZipRecruiter \u2014 Shares of ZipRecruiter slipped 5% even though it posted second-quarter results that were better than expected. The company said it sees employers pulling back on job postings. It also expects the labor market's strength may weaken through the end of the year and lowered its full-year revenue outlook to reflect the economic backdrop.\n\nZoom Video \u2014 Shares of the video teleconferencing service fell about 5% after Citi downgraded the company, saying growing competition from Microsoft Teams could push the stock down 20%. The bank said Zoom has too many post-pandemic challenges in addition to rising competition, including macro-related weakness hitting businesses and margin risk.\n\nSnowflake \u2014 The cloud computing company's shares fell 5% after UBS downgraded them to neutral from buy amid mounting macro and competitive pressures. UBS also cited a slowdown in customer spending of cloud computing as well as rising competition.\n\nThredUp \u2014 The apparel reselling platform operator rallied more than 17% after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue, as well as a 29% increase in active buyers.\n\nAlly Financial \u2014 Shares of the home and auto lender jumped over 3% after a regulatory filing showed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway more than tripled its position in the company's last quarter. Berkshire held roughly 30 million shares of Ally, worth about $1 billion, at the end of June. The conglomerate initiated the bet in the first quarter.\n\nMasimo \u2014 Shares of the medical technology developer jumped more than 6% after activist investor Politan Capital Management took a 9% stake in the company. Politan said it's dedicated to improving Masimo's stock price.\n\nBHP Group \u2014 Shares of the Australian mining company rose more than 5% after BHP reported that its total profit for the 2022 fiscal year was $30.9 billion, compared to $11.3 billion in the prior year.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Yun Li, Carmen Reinicke and Jesse Pound contributed reporting.",

        "text": "Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a \"Morning Meeting\" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Tuesday's key moments: We want growth without inflation WMT, HD earnings beats boost retailers Quick mentions: CTRA, DIS, WFC 1. We want growth without inflation Stocks were mixed Tuesday, with tech names keeping a lid on the Nasdaq as bond yields moved higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up for its fifth straight session. West Texas Intermediate crude, the American oil benchmark, fell 2.5%, which bodes well for inflation. Jim Cramer has repeatedly said that he believes oil's peak in June helped cool down inflation in July. While the market and economy have shown promising signs recently, Jim emphasized Tuesday: \"We want growth without inflation. We don't want oil to be too hot.\" 2. WMT, HD earnings beats boost retailers Home Depot (HD) and Walmart (WMT) reported earnings beats before the bell on Tuesday, pushing other retailers' stocks up, including Club holding Costco (COST). While we held positions in both Walmart and Costco earlier this year, we sold off the former after its warnings of excess inventory and the potential impact to its bottom line. Costco, on the other hand, has not faced the same kind of inventory issues. It's also successfully raised prices for some items and held prices steady for others, all while maintaining strong sales. This week is chock-full of other retailers reporting earnings. See a list here . We'll be watching each one as they reveal their financial results, and in turn, provide insights on consumers spending and inflation. 3. Quick mentions: CTRA, DIS, WFC We also have updates on some other Club names. Natural gas soared roughly 5% on Tuesday, spiking to its highest level since late July. This is good news for Club holding Coterra Energy (CTRA), which Jim calls \"the best natural gas company in the country.\" We have reviewed Dan Loeb's recommendations on Disney (DIS), and we believe there's nothing revelatory there. Cost cutting, for example, is something we're sure the company already has on its radar. As for Loeb's urging that Disney spin off ESPN, we believe that while that could be good for the company's bottom-line in the short-term, having a live sports component to its streaming is crucial, especially since it helps differentiate its product from other services like Netflix (NFLX). Banks have been performing well recently, and we believe that the best ones to own right now are Bank of America (BAC) and Club holding Wells Fargo (WFC) for their large deposit bases. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long CTRA, COST, DIS and WFC. See here for a full list of the stocks.) As a subscriber to the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer, you will receive a trade alert before Jim makes a trade. Jim waits 45 minutes after sending a trade alert before buying or selling a stock in his charitable trust's portfolio. If Jim has talked about a stock on CNBC TV, he waits 72 hours after issuing the trade alert before executing the trade.

        "text": "If the U.S. economy is in recession, someone forgot to tell the jobs market. The employment picture over the past six months is behaving nothing like an economy in a downturn, instead creating jobs at a rapid pace of nearly 460,000 a month. Research from CNBC's Steve Liesman indicates that during a typical downturn, the employment picture would be far gloomier, losing ground instead of gaining. Several charts presented during Wednesday's \"Squawk Box\" help paint the picture. The CNBC team looked at economic data going back to 1947. It indicated that when gross domestic product has been negative for six months, as is the case for 2022, payrolls fall by an average of 0.5 percentage point. But this year, the job count actually has increased by 1%.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards CNBC\n\nData from human relations software company UKG backs up that notion, with internal data that shows jobs have been created about in line with the Bureau of Labor Statistics' count.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nFinally, the Dallas Federal Reserve, in research posted Tuesday, said its analysis of multiple data points found \"that most indicators \u2014 particularly those measuring labor markets \u2014 provide strong evidence that the U.S. economy did not fall into a recession in the first quarter\" of the year. One data point the central bank's researchers looked at was real personal consumption expenditures. They found that consumption generally declined during recessions. By contrast, the measure increased during the first half of 2022.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards",

Joe Raedle | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nBed Bath & Beyond shares soared Tuesday as retail traders active on social media piled into the stock, encouraged by news that GameStop Chairman Ryan Cohen placed another bet on the struggling retailer. Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond skyrocketed more than 70% to an intraday high of $28.04 in midday trading Tuesday amid multiple halts due to volatility. The stock ended the session 29% higher.\n\nLoading chart...\n\nA regulatory filing Monday evening showed that Cohen's venture capital firm RC Ventures bought distant out-of-the-money call options on more than 1.6 million Bed Bath & Beyond shares with strike prices between $60 and $80. Investors profit from calls when the underlying securities rise in prices. The strike price is where the security can be bought by the option holder, meaning Cohen is betting that Bed Bath & Beyond can rise as high as $80 a share. The stock closed Monday at $16. The call options that Cohen bought expire in January 2023.\n\nThe new purchase grabbed the attention of retail traders on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum. The ticker BBBY became the most popular mention in the chat room Tuesday, according to alternative data provider Quiver Quantitative. Trading volumes in Bed Bath & Beyond exploded Tuesday with more than 160 million shares changing hands as of noon ET. The company only has about 80 million shares outstanding, according to a regulatory filing. Cohen first revealed he held a nearly 10% stake in Bed Bath & Beyond through RC Ventures in early March. FactSet says his holdings amounted to 11.82% as of late March. At the time, the GameStop chairman wrote a letter to Bed Bath's then CEO, Mark Tritton, saying he believed the home goods chain was struggling to reverse market share declines and navigate supply chain woes. He also urged the retailer to consider selling its Buybuy Baby chain.",

Scott Mlyn | CNBC\n\nIt wasn't long ago that Amazon, Shopify and Peloton doubled their workforces to manage through the pandemic surge, while Morgan Stanley staffed up to handle a record level of IPOs, and mortgage lenders added headcount as rock-bottom rates led to a refinancing boom. On the flipside, Delta Air Lines, Hilton Worldwide and legions of restaurants slashed headcount because of lockdowns that rolled through much of the country and other parts of the world. Now, they're scrambling to reverse course. Companies that hired like crazy in 2020 and 2021 to meet customer demand are being forced to make sweeping cuts or impose hiring freezes with a possible recession on the horizon. In a matter of months, CEOs have gone from hypergrowth mode to concerns over \"macroeconomic uncertainty,\" a phrase investors have heard many times on second-quarter earnings calls. Stock trading app Robinhood and crypto exchange Coinbase both recently slashed more than 1,000 jobs after their splashy market debuts in 2021. Meanwhile, airlines, hotels and eateries face the opposite problem as their businesses continue to pick up following the era of Covid-induced shutdowns. After instituting mass layoffs early in the pandemic, they can't hire quickly enough to satisfy demand and are dealing with a labor market radically different from the one they experienced over two years ago, before the cutbacks. \"The pandemic created very unique, once-in-a-lifetime conditions in many different industries that caused a dramatic reallocation of capital,\" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at job recruiting site ZipRecruiter. \"Many of those conditions no longer apply so you're seeing a reallocation of capital back to more normal patterns.\"\n\nFor employers, those patterns are particularly challenging to navigate, because inflation levels have jumped to a 40-year high, and the Fed has lifted its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point on consecutive occasions for the first time since the early 1990s. The central bank's efforts to tamp down inflation have raised concerns that the U.S. economy is headed for recession. Gross domestic product has fallen for two straight quarters, hitting a widely accepted rule of thumb for recession, though the National Bureau of Economic Research hasn't yet made that declaration. The downward trend was bound to happen eventually, and market experts lamented the frothiness in stock prices and absurdity of valuations as late as the fourth quarter of last year, when the major indexes hit record highs led by the riskiest assets. That was never more evident than in November, when electric vehicle maker Rivian went public on almost no revenue and quickly reached a market cap of over $150 billion. Bitcoin hit a record the same day, touching close to $69,000. Since then, bitcoin is off by two-thirds, and Rivian has lost about 80% of its value. In July, the car company started layoffs of about 6% of its workforce. Rivian's headcount almost quintupled to around 14,000 between late 2020 and mid-2022.\n\nTech layoffs and an air of caution\n\nJob cuts and hiring slowdowns were big talking points on tech earnings calls last week. Amazon reduced its headcount by 99,000 people to 1.52 million employees at the end of the second quarter after almost doubling in size during the pandemic, when it needed to beef up its warehouse capabilities. Shopify, whose cloud technology helps retailers build and manage online stores, cut about 1,000 workers, or around 10% of its global workforce. The company doubled its headcount over a two-year period starting at the beginning of 2020, as the business boomed from the number or stores and restaurants that had to suddenly go digital. Shopify CEO Tobias Lutke said in a memo to employees that the company had wagered that the pandemic surge would cause the transition from physical retail to ecommerce to \"permanently leap ahead by 5 or even 10 years.\" \"It's now clear that bet didn't pay off,\" Lutke wrote, adding that the picture was starting to look more like it did before Covid. \"Ultimately, placing this bet was my call to make and I got this wrong. Now, we have to adjust.\" After Facebook parent Meta missed on its results and forecast a second straight quarter of declining revenue, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will be reducing job growth over the next year. Headcount expanded by about 60% during the pandemic. \"This is a period that demands more intensity and I expect us to get more done with fewer resources,\" Zuckerberg said. Google parent Alphabet, which grew its workforce by over 30% during the two Covid years, recently told employees that they needed to focus and improve productivity. The company asked for suggestions on how to be more efficient at work.\n\n\"It's clear we are facing a challenging macro environment with more uncertainty ahead,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said in a meeting with employees. \"We should think about how we can minimize distractions and really raise the bar on both product excellence and productivity.\" Few U.S. companies have been hit as hard as Peloton, whose fitness equipment and on-demand classes became an instant gym replacement during lockdowns and which has since suffered from massive oversupply issues and out-of-control costs. After doubling headcount in the 12 months ended June 30, 2021, the company in February announced plans to cut 20% of corporate positions as it named a new CEO.\n\nBanks and Wall Street bracing for a 'hurricane'\n\nSome of the Peloton products that were flying off the shelves in the pandemic were being offered as perks for overworked junior bankers, who were sorely needed to help manage a boom in IPOs, mergers and stock issuance. Activity picked up with such ferocity that junior bankers were complaining about 100-hour workweeks, and banks started scouting for talent in unusual places like consulting and accounting firms. That helps explain why the six biggest U.S. banks added a combined 59,757 employees from the start of 2020 through the middle of 2022, the equivalent of the industry picking up the full population of a Morgan Stanley or a Goldman Sachs in a little over two years. It wasn't just investment banking. The government unleashed trillions of dollars in stimulus payments and small business loans designed to keep the economy moving amid the widespread shutdowns. A feared wave of loan defaults never arrived, and banks instead took in an unprecedented flood of deposits. Their Main Street lending operations had better repayment rates than before the pandemic. Among top banks, Morgan Stanley saw the biggest jump in headcount, with its employee levels expanding 29% to 78,386 from early 2020 to the middle of this year. The growth was fueled in part by CEO James Gorman\u2019s acquisitions of money management firms E-Trade and Eaton Vance. At rival investment bank Goldman Sachs, staffing levels jumped 22% to 47,000 in the same time frame, as CEO David Solomon broke into consumer finance and bolstered wealth management operations, including through the acquisition of fintech lender GreenSky. Citigroup saw a 15% boost in headcount during the pandemic, while JPMorgan Chase added 8.5% to its workforce, becoming the industry's largest employer. But the good times on Wall Street didn\u2019t last. The stock market had its worst first half in 50 years, and IPOs dried up. Investment banking revenue at the major players declined sharply in the second quarter. Goldman Sachs responded by slowing hiring and is considering a return to year-end job reductions, according to a person with knowledge of the bank\u2019s plans. Employees typically make up the single biggest line item when it comes to expenses in banking, so when markets crater, layoffs are usually on the horizon. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in June that an economic \"hurricane\" was on its way, and said the bank was bracing itself for volatile markets.\n\nJamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., during a Bloomberg Television interview in London, U.K., on Wednesday, May 4, 2022. Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nZipRecruiter's Pollak said one area in finance where there will likely be a hemorrhaging of workers is in mortgage lending. She said 60% more people went into real estate in 2020 and 2021 because of record low mortgage rates and rising home prices. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo have reportedly trimmed hundreds of mortgage staffers as volumes collapsed. \"Nobody is refinancing anymore, and sales are slowing,\" Pollak said. \"You're going to have to see employment levels and hiring slow down. That growth was all about that moment.\" The intersection of Silicon Valley and Wall Street is a particularly gloomy place at the moment as rising rates and crumbling stock multiples converge. Crypto trading platform Coinbase in June announced plans to lay off 18% of its workforce in preparation for a \"crypto winter\" and even rescinded job offers to people it had hired. Headcount tripled in 2021 to 3,730 employees. Stock trading app Robinhood said Tuesday it's cutting about 23% of its workforce, a little over three months after eliminating 9% of its full-time staff, which had ballooned from 2,100 to 3,800 in the last nine months of 2021. \"We are at the tail end of that pandemic-era distortion,\" said Aaron Terrazas, chief economist at job search and review site Glassdoor. \"Obviously, it's not going away, but it is changing to a more normalized period, and companies are adapting to this new reality.\"\n\nRetail is whipsawing back and forth\n\nNurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThey hardly could have predicted how quickly the dynamic would shift, as rapid and soaring inflation forced Americans to tighten their belts. Retailers have already started to warn of waning demand, leaving them with bloated inventories. Gap said higher promotions will hurt gross margins in its fiscal second quarter. Kohl's cut its guidance for the second quarter, citing softened consumer spending. Walmart last week slashed its profit forecast and said surging prices for food and gas are squeezing consumers. That pain is filtering into the ad market. Online bulletin board Pinterest on Monday cited \"lower than expected demand from U.S. big box retailers and mid-market advertisers\" as one reason why it missed Wall Street estimates for second-quarter earnings and revenue. Retail giants have so far avoided big layoff announcements, but smaller players are in cut mode. Stitch Fix, 7-Eleven and Game Stop have said they'll be eliminating jobs, and outdoor grill maker Weber warned it's considering layoffs as sales slow.\n\nThe travel industry can't hire fast enough\n\nWith all of the downsizing taking place across wide swaths of the U.S. economy, the applicant pool should be wide open for airlines, restaurants and hospitality companies, which are trying to repopulate their ranks after undergoing mass layoffs when Covid hit. It's not so easy. Even though Amazon has reduced headcount of late, it's still got far more people working in its warehouses than it did two years ago. Last year the company lifted average starting pay to $18 an hour, a level that's difficult to meet for much of the services industry. Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta said on the quarterly earnings call in May that he wasn't satisfied with customer service and that the company needs more workers. At the end of last year, even as travel was rebounding sharply, headcount at Hilton's managed, owned and leased properties as well as corporate locations was down by over 30,000 from two years earlier. It's easy to see why customer service is a challenge. According to a report last week from McKinsey on summer 2022 travel trends, revenue per available room in the U.S. \"is outstripping not just 2020 and 2021 levels, but increasingly 2019 levels too.\"\n\nDelta Airlines passenger jets are pictured outside the newly completed 1.3 million-square foot $4 billion Delta Airlines Terminal C at LaGuardia Airport in New York, June 1, 2022.

        "text": "In this article CMCSA\n\nMark Hoffman, Chairman of CNBC\n\nMark Hoffman, CNBC's president since 2005 and chairman since 2015, announced Tuesday he will step down on Sept. 12. Hoffman is leaving of his own accord. NBCUniversal hired Cesar Conde to oversee NBC News, MSNBC and CNBC in May 2020 to bring more centralized leadership to the group. KC Sullivan will return to replace Hoffman as CNBC's new president. Sullivan has spent the last two years as president and managing director of NBCUniversal's global advertising and partnerships, based in London. Before that, he was president and managing director of CNBC International and CNBC's chief financial officer.\n\nSullivan will return to the U.S. for his new role. Hoffman will stay on as a consultant through the transition, Conde wrote in a note to NBCUniversal employees. \"Mark has overseen the steady continued growth of CNBC as the world's #1 business and money news brand,\" Conde said. \"No business news organization comes close to the reach and influence of CNBC, a true testament to Mark's leadership.\" CNBC is one of NBCUniversal's most consistently profitable assets, even as millions of Americans drop linear cable TV subscriptions each year. Hoffman, 65, has increased profitability at CNBC in 16 of his 17 years running the company. CNBC is set to grow its profitability again in 2022, according to a person familiar with the matter. \"We are in the business of business so it's important to note we've never been more profitable, setting record after record in financial performance, year after year, as we maneuvered through economic cycles, exogenous events and the historic secular change that accompanied the information age,\" Hoffman said in a note to CNBC employees.\n\nHoffman's CNBC tenure\n\nHoffman first joined CNBC in 1997 before leaving in 2001 for a series of leadership positions at local TV stations. He returned to CNBC in 2005 and immediately pushed to acquire 50% equity interests in CNBC Europe and CNBC Asia from Dow Jones, as well as a 25% stake in CNBC World. With financial control over its international properties, Hoffman expanded CNBC's TV reach and turned his attention to growing CNBC's digital business. CNBC.com has grown sixfold in the past six years, with unique monthly readership growing from about 30 million to nearly 200 million.",

        "text": "Both Bullard and Mester are voting members this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. The group last week approved a second consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase to the Fed's benchmark borrowing rate.\n\nThat message of continued rate hikes is consistent with other Fed speakers this week , including regional presidents Loretta Mester of Cleveland, Charles Evans of Chicago and Mary Daly of San Francisco. Each said Tuesday that the inflation fight is far from over and more monetary policy tightening will be needed.\n\n\"I think we'll probably have to be higher for longer in order to get the evidence that we need to see that inflation is actually turning around on all dimensions and in a convincing way coming lower, not just a tick lower here and there,\" Bullard said during a live \" Squawk Box \" interview on CNBC.\n\nThe central bank official said he expects another 1.5 percentage points or so in interest rate increases this year as the Fed continues to battle the highest inflation levels since the early 1980s.\n\nSt. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Wednesday that the central bank will continue raising rates until it sees compelling evidence that inflation is falling.\n\nIf Bullard has his way, the rate will continue rising to a range of 3.75%-4% by the end of the year. After starting 2022 near zero, the rate has now come up to a range of 2.25%-2.5%.\n\nConsumer price inflation is running at a 12-month rate of 9.1%, its highest since November 1981. Even throwing out the highs and lows of inflation, as the Dallas Fed does with its \"trimmed mean\" estimate, inflation is running at 4.3%.\n\n\"We're going to have to see convincing evidence across the board, headline and other measures of core inflation, all coming down convincingly before we'll be able to feel like we're doing our job,\" Bullard said.\n\nThe rate hikes come at a time of slowing growth in the U.S., which has seen consecutive quarters of negative GDP readings, a common definition of recession. However, Bullard said he doesn't think the economy is really in recession.\n\n\"We're not in a recession right now. We do have these two quarters of negative GDP growth. To some extent, a recession is in the eyes of the beholder,\" he said. \"With all the job growth in the first half of the year, it's hard to say there's a recession. With a flat unemployment rate at 3.6%, it's hard to say there's a recession.\"\n\nThe second half of the year should see reasonably strong growth, though job gains probably will slow to their longer-run trend, he added. July's nonfarm payroll growth is expected to be 258,000, according to Dow Jones estimates.\n\nEven with the slowing trend, markets are pricing in another half percentage point rate hike from the Fed in September, though the chances of a third consecutive 0.75 percentage point move are rising. The market then expects future increases in November and December, taking the benchmark fed funds rate to a range of 3.25%-3.5% by the end of the year, below Bullard's target.\n\n\"We're going to follow the data very carefully, and I think we'll get it right,\" Bullard said.",

        "text": "A cooldown in the job market is underway: The number of job openings dropped in June while near-record numbers of people continued to quit and get hired into new roles, according to the Labor Department's latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary. The labor market posted 10.7 million new job openings in June, which is down from 11.3 million in May but also much higher than a year ago and a more than 50% increase from before the pandemic. Despite the drop, there are still roughly 1.8 open jobs for every person who is unemployed. Meanwhile, workers are continuing to leverage the market and make moves: 6.4 million people were hired into new jobs, and 4.2 million voluntarily quit \u2014 leveling off from record highs but still extremely elevated. The job market cooldown is \"far from a plunge,\" says Nick Bunker, director of economic research at Indeed Hiring Lab. \"The labor market is loosening a bit, but by any standard it is still quite tight,\" Bunker adds. \"The outlook for economic growth may not be as rosy as it was a few months ago, but there's no sign of imminent danger in the labor market.\"\n\nPeople are concerned about the future of jobs but are still quitting now\n\nWorkers are growing more concerned about having their pick of jobs in the months to come, but it's not stopping many of them from calling it quits right now. The share of people who left their jobs voluntarily in June make up 2.8% of the workforce. Workers' confidence in the job market decreased slightly in June and July compared with May, according to a ZipRecruiter index measuring sentiment across 1,500 people. The index also showed an uptick in job-seekers who believe there will be fewer jobs six months from now, a decrease in people who say their job search is going well and a slight increase in people who feel financial pressure to accept the first job offer they receive. People may also be spooked by headlines of big-name companies, especially ones across tech and housing sectors that saw Covid-era growth, announcing layoffs, hiring freezes and rescinded job offers in recent months. Bunker recognizes \"there are pockets of the economy and labor market going through turbulence,\" he says, \"but they're for the most part concentrated pockets.\" These workers may also be getting hired into new jobs pretty quickly. The national unemployment rate held steady at 3.6% in June. Looking ahead, Bunker expects to see payroll growth and expanding employment in the jobs report out Friday. \"If you're thinking of switching jobs, it's still a good time,\" he says, adding that job-seekers may focus more on going to an industry, sector or employer with a \"strong economic outlook.\"\n\nA hiring slowdown doesn't indicate an inevitable recession",

        "text": "Mary Daly, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, poses after giving a speech on the U.S. economic outlook, in Idaho Falls, Idaho, U.S., November 12 2018.\n\nThe Federal Reserve still has a lot of work to do before it gets inflation under control, and that means higher interest rates, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Tuesday.\n\n\"People are still struggling with the higher prices they're paying and the rising prices,\" Daly said during a live LinkedIn interview with CNBC's Jon Fortt. \"The number of people who can't afford this week what they paid for with ease six months ago just means our work is far from done.\"\n\nSeparately, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans opened up the possibility of another large rate hike ahead, but said he hopes that can be avoided, with the Fed being able to bring down inflation without having to use harsh policy tightening.\n\nSo far this year, the central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate four times, totaling 2.25 percentage points. That has come in response to inflation running at a 9.1% annual rate, the highest level since November 1981.\n\nThe Fed in July raised its funds rate 0.75 percentage point, the same as it hiked in June. Those were the largest back-to-back increases since the central bank started using the funds rate as its chief monetary policy tool in the early 1990s.\n\nBut Daly cautioned that no one should take those big moves as an indication that the Fed is winding down its rate hikes.\n\n\"Nowhere near almost done,\" she said in assessing the progress. \"We have made a good start and I feel really pleased with where we've gotten to at this point.\"\n\nFutures pricing indicates the markets see the Fed raising rates by 0.5 percentage point in September and another half percentage point through the end of the year, taking the funds rate to a range of 3.25%-3.5%, according to CME Group data. That scenario holds that the economy would slow due to the policy tightening, and the Fed would start cutting rates by next summer.\n\nBut Daly pushed back on that notion.\n\n\"That's a puzzle to me,\" she said. \"I don't know where they find that in the data. To me, that would not be my modal outlook.\"\n\nEvans, her Fed colleague, also spoke Tuesday morning, saying the central bank is likely to keep its foot on the brake until it sees inflation coming down. He expects policymakers to raise rates by half a percentage point at their next meeting in September, but left the door open to a bigger move.\n\n\"Fifty [basis points] is a reasonable assessment, but 75 could also be OK,\" he told reporters. \"I doubt that more would be called for.\" A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.\n\n\"We wanted to get to neutral expeditiously. We want to get a little restrictive expeditiously,\" Evans added. \"We want to see if the real side effects are going to start coming back in line ... or if we have a lot more ahead of us.\"\n\nHowever, he also said he's hopeful that policymakers could soon pause the rate hikes as inflation comes down.\n\nNeither Evans nor Daly are voting members this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, though they do participate in policy sessions.\n\nThe FOMC does not meet in August, when it will hold its annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Its next two-day meeting is next month, Sept. 20-21.",

Viking's second-quarter regulatory filing, released on Monday, shows that the fund initiated a stake of more than $500 million in AIG . Viking also scooped up more than 1.3 million shares of Elevance Health , bringing its stake in the company formerly known as Anthem to more than $700 million. Additionally, Viking added to positions in Chubb and Centene, which were both among its top 10 holdings at the end of June. The fund run by Andreas Halvorsen had roughly $47 billion in assets under management at the end of December, according to its website. The fund's equity exposure shown in Monday's report totaled nearly $22 billion. In addition to AIG, Viking revealed new stakes in McKesson , Lam Research , Disney and Intuit . The fund also more than doubled its position in Facebook-parent Meta to a stake worth $462 million at the end of June. Viking trimmed some of its top holdings, including cutting nearly a third of its top holding T-Mobile and more than 10% of its stake in Microsoft . Viking closed out several major positions, as well. The largest was Comcast , which was worth roughly $660 million at the end of the first quarter. Deere , Match and Shopify were among the other nine-figure positions that were eliminated.

        "text": "A \"For Sale\" sign outside a house in Albany, California, US, on Tuesday, May 31, 2022. Homebuyers are facing a worsening affordability situation with mortgage rates hovering around the highest levels in more than a decade.\n\nMortgage balances rose 1.9% for the quarter, or $207 billion, to about $11.4 trillion, even though the pace of originations moved lower. That annual increase marked a 9.1% gain from a year ago as home prices exploded during the pandemic era.\n\n\"Americans are borrowing more, but a big part of the increased borrowing is attributable to higher prices,\" the New York Fed said in a blog post accompanying the release.\n\nThe collective American IOU totaled $16.15 trillion through the end of June, good for a $312 billion \u2014 or 2% \u2014 increase from the previous quarter. Debt gains were widespread but particularly focused on mortgages and vehicle purchases.\n\nHousehold debt climbed past $16 trillion in the second quarter for the first time, as soaring inflation pushed up housing and auto balances, the New York Federal Reserve reported Tuesday.\n\nCredit card balances surged $46 billion in the three-month period and 13% over the past year, which Fed researchers said was the largest gain in more than 20 years. Non-housing credit balances increased 2.4% from the first quarter, the biggest gain since 2016.\n\nStudent loan debt was little changed at $1.59 trillion.\n\nThe increase in borrowing comes with inflation running at an 8.6% annual rate in the second quarter that included a 9.1% increase in June \u2014 the biggest move since November 1981 \u2014 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Shelter inflation rose at a 5.5% annual rate in June and new and used vehicle prices were up 11.4% and 7.1% respectively.\n\nIn response to the elevated inflation levels, the Fed has raised interest rates four times in 2022, with the increases totaling 2.25 percentage points. Those moves in turn have pushed up 30-year mortgage rates to 5.41%, up more than 2 percentage points from the beginning of the year, according to Freddie Mac.\n\nDespite the rising debt and inflation levels and higher interest rates, delinquency rates remained relatively benign.\n\n\"Although debt balances are growing rapidly, households in general have weathered the pandemic remarkably well, due in no small part to the expansive programs put in place to support them,\" the Fed blog post said. \"Further, household debt is held overwhelmingly by higher-score borrowers, even more so now than it has been in the history of our data.\"\n\nThrough June, some 2.7% of outstanding debt was in delinquency, nearly 2 percentage points lower than the first quarter of 2020 as the nation was entering the Covid pandemic.\n\nFed economists noted that delinquency rates were nudging higher for subprime borrowers at the lower end of the credit scale.",

Separations also edged lower, falling by 1.4% to 5.93 million.\n\nFederal Reserve officials watch the JOLTS numbers closely as they assess the future path of the labor market and how that might influence interest rates. The Fed has enacted four interest rate increases this year totaling 2.25 percentage points in an effort to control inflation that has run at its fastest rate since November 1981.\n\nNonfarm payrolls rose by 372,000 in June and the unemployment rate held at 3.6%. July's numbers will be out Friday, with economists surveyed by Dow Jones are looking for an increase of 258,000.",

        "text": "A sign is posted in front of a home for sale on July 14, 2022 in San Francisco, California. The number of homes for sale in the U.S. increased by 2 percent in June for the first time since 2019.\n\nPrice gains are still strong because of an imbalance between supply and demand. The housing market has had a severe shortage for years. Strong demand during the coronavirus pandemic exacerbated it.\n\nHome prices are still higher than they were a year ago, but the gains slowed at the fastest pace on record in June, according to Black Knight, a mortgage software, data and analytics firm that began tracking this metric in the early 1970s. The annual rate of price appreciation fell two percentage points from 19.3% to 17.3%.\n\nRising mortgage rates and inflation in the wider economy caused housing demand to drop sharply in June, forcing home prices to cool down.\n\nEven when home prices crashed dramatically during the recession of 2007-09, the strongest single-month slowdown was 1.19 percentage points. Prices are not expected to fall nationally, given a stronger overall housing market, but higher mortgage rates are certainly taking their toll.\n\nThe average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage crossed above 6% in June, according to Mortgage News Daily. It has since dropped back into the lower 5% range, but that is still significantly higher than the 3% range rates were in at the start of this year.\n\n\"The slowdown was broad-based among the top 50 markets at the metro level, with some areas experiencing even more pronounced cooling,\" said Ben Graboske, president of Black Knight Data & Analytics. \"In fact, 25% of major U.S. markets saw growth slow by three percentage points in June, with four decelerating by four or more points in that month alone.\"\n\nStill, while this was the sharpest cooling on record nationally, the market would have to see six more months of this kind of deceleration for price growth to return to long-run averages, according to Graboske. He calculates that it takes about five months for interest rate impacts to be fully reflected in home prices.\n\nMarkets seeing the sharpest drops are those that previously had the highest prices in the nation. Average home values in San Jose, California, have fallen 5.1% in the last two months, the biggest drop of any of the top markets. That chopped $75,000 off the price.\n\nIn Seattle, prices are down 3.8% in the past two months, or a $30,000 reduction. San Francisco, San Diego and Denver round out the top five markets with the biggest price reductions.\n\nThe cooling in prices coincides with a sharp jump in the supply of homes for sale, up 22% over the last two months, according to Black Knight. Inventory is still, however, 54% lower than 2017-19 levels.\n\n\"With a national shortage of more than 700,000 listings, it would take more than a year of such record increases for inventory levels to fully normalize,\" said Graboske.\n\nPrice drops will not affect the average homeowner as much as they did during the Great Recession, because homeowners today have considerably more equity. Tight underwriting and several years of strong price appreciation caused home equity levels to hit record highs.\n\nDespite that, the strong demand in the market recently could present a problem for some. About 10% of mortgaged properties were purchased in the last year, so price drops could cause some borrowers to edge much lower in their equity positions.",

It's a buffered ETF using a risk reversal strategy to minimize downside while also putting a cap on gains.\n\n\"You buy TSLH, hedge Tesla, you get basically 10% on the upside, and you have a 10% floor,\" Bond explained on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" last week. \"Now what a floor is \u2013 that's a max loss of 10%. If Tesla goes down 20%, you lose 10%. If it goes down 50%, you lose 10%.\"\n\nTreasury bills make up about 90% of the hedged fund \"to construct a potential floor against significant losses on a quarterly basis,\" Innovator ETFs reported in the ETF launch news release. \"A call option spread on TSLA using FLEX options\" makes up the remainder of the fund's portfolio.\n\n\"The projected upside cap for the balance of the current calendar quarter (through September) is 8.70%,\" the company also said.\n\nIts floor resets each calendar quarter but will never surpass 10%, Bond explained to CNBC, noting the ETF's floor rested at 9.23% when it launched.\n\nThe Innovator Hedged TSLA Strategy ETF is up 5% since its launch on July 26. Meanwhile, Tesla shares are up 12% in the same time period.\n\nIt's not the first time Bond's company launched an ETF using this risk reversal strategy.\n\nInnovator ETFs started the Innovator Defined Wealth Shield ETF (BALT) last year that focusing the S&P 500 index.\n\nBut the strategy is under fire by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler released a statement not long after addressing risks that may stem from \"complex\" exchange-traded products such as leveraged or inverse ETFs, emphasizing potential issues with their short-term nature.\n\n\"These ETPs, however, can pose risks even to sophisticated investors, and can potentially create system-wide risks by operating in unanticipated ways when markets experience volatility or stress conditions,\" Gensler's Oct. 2021 statement said,\n\nGensler proposed \"potential rulemaking\" to help protect individual investors. However, Bond defended Innovator ETFs' products, suggesting buffers offer significant risk control value.\n\nThe SEC declined to provide a statement.",

        "text": "If you're debating whether or not the U.S. is in a recession, you're asking the wrong question, according to a top Federal Reserve official.\n\n\"Whether we are technically in a recession or not doesn't change my analysis,\" Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday. \"I'm focused on the inflation data. I'm focused on the wage data. And so far, inflation continues to surprise us to the upside. Wages continue to grow.\"\n\nLast month, U.S. inflation jumped to a four-decade record high, rising 9.1% from a year ago. At the same time, the labor market remained strong: Nonfarm payrolls increased by 372,000 last month, alongside a low national unemployment rate of 3.6%.\n\nOn Thursday, new Labor Department data showed signs of a job market cooldown, with initial jobless claims hitting their highest level since mid-November. Still, Kashkari said, the labor market is \"very, very strong.\"\n\n\"Typically, recessions demonstrate high job losses, high unemployment, those are terrible for American families. And we're not seeing anything like that,\" he said.\n\nThe problem, Kashkari said, is that even in a strong job market, inflation is outpacing wage growth \u2014 giving many Americans a functional \"wage cut\" as living costs increase nationwide. Solving that problem by reducing inflation is the Federal Reserve's top goal right now, he added.\n\n\"Whether we are technically in a recession or not doesn't change the fact that the Federal Reserve has its own work to do, and we are committed to doing it,\" Kashkari said.\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Thursday that the country's gross domestic product shrunk for the second straight quarter, often a warning sign accompanying economic recessions. For Kashkari, that may actually be a good thing: An economic slowdown could help reduce inflation to the point where it no longer outpaces wage growth.\n\n\"We definitely want to see some slowing [of economic growth],\" he said. \"We don't want to see the economy overheating. We would love it if we could transition to a sustainable economy without tipping the economy into recession.\"\n\nDoing so poses a significant challenge for the Fed. Kashkari acknowledged that economic slowdowns tend to be very difficult to control, \"especially if it's the central bank that's inducing the slowdown.\"\n\nStill, he said, the bank will do whatever is necessary to tame inflation.\n\n\"We're going to do everything we can to avoid a recession, but we are committed to bringing inflation down, and we are going to do what we need to do,\" Kashkari said. \"We are a long way away from achieving an economy that is back at 2% inflation. And that's where we need to get to.\"",
