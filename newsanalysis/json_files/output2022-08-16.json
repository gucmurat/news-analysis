        "text": "Millions of people are being short-changed on savings rates, with banks and building societies failing to pass on this month\u2019s 0.5 percentage point interest rate rise, research has claimed.\n\nWhat\u2019s happened?\n\nOn 4 August, the Bank of England pushed up interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 1.75% as the UK battles to prevent inflation running out of control. It was the sixth successive interest rate hike.\n\nIn theory this is good news for the UK\u2019s army of savers, who were the losers from years of interest rate cuts. Many will have been expecting to see the rates on their savings accounts climb \u2013 but the reality has all too often been very different.\n\nSo what\u2019s the bad news?\n\nResearch issued on Tuesday found that as of 15 August, Britain\u2019s banks and building societies had passed on the full 0.5 percentage point increase to just two out of 233 easy access savings accounts.\n\nAs of that date, the only provider to pass on all of the increase was the West Brom building society, according to the study by the website Investing Reviews.\n\nProviders that had given their accounts some sort of boost \u2013 that is, they had passed on part of the increase \u2013 included Zopa, Tesco Bank, Atom Bank, Tandem Bank, Skipton building society and Gatehouse Bank, it said.\n\nIn all, only 26 easy access accounts (11.2%) had seen any increase at all in the rate paid following the 4 August rise, the study said.\n\nDo banks have to pass on interest rate rises?\n\nAccount providers are at liberty to do what they want with savings rates unfortunately. They might decide to pass on all, some or none of an interest rate rise (or reduction).\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So \u2013 taking a glass-half-full view \u2013 just because your account has not as of today had its rate increased does not mean you will not get an increase.\n\nOne expert said: \u201cTo be fair, it is a little early to see savings changes \u2026 Some brands may only now be catching up to prior base rate rises.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Rachel Springall at the financial data firm Moneyfacts said: \u201cAs we have seen time and time again, there is no guarantee savings providers will boost their rates because of a Bank of England rate rise and, even if they do, it could take a few months to trickle through to customers.\u201d\n\nOn 23 January this year, more than five weeks after the Bank of England lifted the base rate from 0.1% to 0.25%, the Guardian reported that only four financial firms had passed on the full rise to all, or nearly all, of their variable-rate savings account customers.\n\nSo some people have benefited from savings rate increases?\n\nOverall, according to figures issued on Monday by Moneyfacts, the average easy access rate has risen to 0.7% and stands at its highest point in nine years. In August last year the average was 0.18%.\n\nSo why aren\u2019t providers increasing savings rates?\n\nSome experts have previously argued that most of the big banks are uninterested in attracting savers\u2019 deposits.\n\nSome will say the banks are relying on customer apathy. Some customers will quit in search of a better deal, if they can find one, but many others will not notice the change or will not get around to moving their money.\n\nBut rising interest rates are obviously good news for savers?\n\nYes of course, but unfortunately, even if the latest increase is passed on in full, rising inflation \u2013 currently 9.4% and set to go higher \u2013 is eroding the value of people\u2019s nest-egg cash.",

More than one in eight UK households fear they have no further way to make cuts to afford a sharp increase in annual energy bills expected this autumn.\n\nDiscounters Aldi and Lidl both increased sales by double-digit percentages in the three months to 7 August as shoppers sought ways to reduce their bills. Kantar found that together Lidl and Aldi have gained 1.8 percentage points of British grocery sales over this period, representing a \u00a32.3bn annual shift in spending. The homegrown discounter Iceland also increased sales by almost 3%.\n\nAldi is close to overtaking Morrisons to become the UK\u2019s fourth largest supermarket. Its market share rose 0.9 percentage points to 9.1%, a fraction behind Morrisons on 9.3%.\n\nWaitrose, Morrisons and independent stores all saw sales fall back, as the overall grocery market rose 2.2% in the three months.\n\nThe summer weather pushed up sales of mineral water, ice-cream and summer clothing, which rose 23%, 18% and 163% respectively.",

Got straight on the phone and activate,\u201d Mr. Baines rapped in the song, flashing cash and envelopes with preloaded debit cards from the state.\n\n\u201cUnemployment so sweet,\u201d Mr. Baines said.\n\nAll three of those programs are now over. There is no official estimate for the amount of money that was stolen from them \u2014 or from pandemic-relief programs in general. The Justice Department has charged people with about $1 billion in fraud so far, and is investigating other cases involving $6 billion more, investigators said.\n\nBut other reports have suggested the real number could be much higher. One official said the total of \u201cimproper\u201d unemployment payments could be more than $163 billion, as first reported by The Washington Post. In the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, a watchdog found that $58 billion had been paid to companies that shared the same addresses, phone numbers, bank accounts or other data as other applicants \u2014 a sign of potential fraud.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear there\u2019s tens of billions in fraud,\u201d said Michael Horowitz, the chairman of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, which includes 21 agency inspectors general working on fraud cases. \u201cWould it surprise me if it exceeded $100 billion? No.\u201d\n\nThe effort to catch fraudsters began as soon as the money started flowing, and the first person was charged with benefit fraud in May 2020. But investigators were quickly deluged with tips at a scale they\u2019d never dealt with before. The Small Business Administration\u2019s fraud hotline \u2014 which had previously received 800 calls a year \u2014 got 148,000 in the first year of the pandemic. The Small Business Administration sent its inspector general two million loan applications to check for potential identity theft. At the Department of Labor, the inspector general\u2019s office has 39,000 cases of suspected unemployment fraud, a 1,000 percent increase from prepandemic levels.\n\nBut prosecutors face a key disadvantage: While fraud takes minutes, investigations take months and prosecutions take even longer.",

In one it is a case of the glass being half full, in the other half empty.\n\nIf you are a government minister you take the former view. Nadhim Zahawi said the unemployment rate of 3.8% has rarely been lower in decades and the chancellor is right about that.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the economy continued to create net new jobs in the three months to June, with employment rising by 160,000 over the quarter. Flash estimates suggest the pattern continued into July.\n\nWith job vacancies at near-record levels, the labour market looks in good shape to withstand the recession the Bank of England is forecasting for the UK. The economy contracted slightly in the three months to June, but demand for workers remained strong.\n\nThat\u2019s the upbeat way of looking at the latest jobs figures from the Office for National Statistics. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, says \u201cby any metric the labour market is still very tight\u201d.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The increase in the size of the workforce is being driven by immigration, he notes, with the number of non-UK nationals either working or looking for a job rising by almost 250,000 in the past year.\n\nThe domestic labour force is also likely to increase as people try to maintain their living standards at a time when cost of living pressures are intensifying, and this will lead to higher unemployment as a weakening economy leads to fewer job opportunities.\n\nUltimately, the labour market data shows where the economy has been but doesn\u2019t necessarily show where it is heading. Employment growth was healthy as the UK came out of lockdown. Annual regular pay growth has picked up to 4.7% as firms have struggled to find workers.\n\nThe question is whether those days are now in the past, as the Bank of England certainly thinks. Threadneedle Street sees a protracted recession pushing the unemployment rate to above 6% by 2025. Judging by the most up-to-date evidence, that process has started.",

That lifted other retail stocks, which led market gains. Bath & Body Works jumped 6%. Target and Best Buy each added about 5%. Ross Stores, Lowe's and TJX Companies climbed about 3% each.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond \u2014 The home retailer's shares skyrocketed about 64%. At its highest, shares added more than 70% to touch an intraday high of $28.60 Tuesday amid multiple trading halts due to volatility. The rally came as retail traders active on social media piled into the stock, encouraged by news that GameStop chair Ryan Cohen placed another bet on the struggling retailer.\n\nNu Holdings \u2014 Shares of the Warren Buffett-backed digital banking company surged more than 23% after the firm reported quarterly revenue that rose 230% from a year earlier. Berkshire Hathaway owned $400 million of Nu Holdings shares at the end of the second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter.\n\nZipRecruiter \u2014 Shares of ZipRecruiter slipped 5% even though it posted second-quarter results that were better than expected. The company said it sees employers pulling back on job postings. It also expects the labor market's strength may weaken through the end of the year and lowered its full-year revenue outlook to reflect the economic backdrop.\n\nZoom Video \u2014 Shares of the video teleconferencing service fell about 5% after Citi downgraded the company, saying growing competition from Microsoft Teams could push the stock down 20%. The bank said Zoom has too many post-pandemic challenges in addition to rising competition, including macro-related weakness hitting businesses and margin risk.\n\nSnowflake \u2014 The cloud computing company's shares fell 5% after UBS downgraded them to neutral from buy amid mounting macro and competitive pressures. UBS also cited a slowdown in customer spending of cloud computing as well as rising competition.\n\nThredUp \u2014 The apparel reselling platform operator rallied more than 17% after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue, as well as a 29% increase in active buyers.\n\nAlly Financial \u2014 Shares of the home and auto lender jumped over 3% after a regulatory filing showed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway more than tripled its position in the company's last quarter. Berkshire held roughly 30 million shares of Ally, worth about $1 billion, at the end of June. The conglomerate initiated the bet in the first quarter.\n\nMasimo \u2014 Shares of the medical technology developer jumped more than 6% after activist investor Politan Capital Management took a 9% stake in the company. Politan said it's dedicated to improving Masimo's stock price.\n\nBHP Group \u2014 Shares of the Australian mining company rose more than 5% after BHP reported that its total profit for the 2022 fiscal year was $30.9 billion, compared to $11.3 billion in the prior year.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Yun Li, Carmen Reinicke and Jesse Pound contributed reporting.",

Kent Nishimura | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Reserve's path to bringing down runaway inflation while keeping the economy from slipping into a major downturn is still open but is getting narrower, according to Goldman Sachs. As the central bank looks to keep raising interest rates, the economy is teeming with mixed signals: rapidly rising payroll figures against sharply declining housing numbers, falling gasoline prices vs. surging shelter and food costs, and low consumer sentiment against steady spending numbers. Amid it all, the Fed is trying to strike a balance between slowing things down, but not by too much. On that score, Goldman economists think there have been clear wins, some losses and a landscape ahead that poses substantial challenges. \"Our broad conclusion is that there is a feasible but difficult path to a soft landing, though several factors beyond the Fed's control can ease or complicate that path and raise or lower the odds of success,\" Goldman economist David Mericle said in a client note Sunday.\n\nSlow growth, high inflation\n\nOne of the biggest inflation drivers has been outsized growth that has created imbalances between supply and demand. The Fed is using interest rate increases to try to damp down demand so supply can catch up, and supply chain pressures, as measured by a New York Fed index, are at their lowest since January 2021. So on that score, Mericle said the Fed's efforts have \"gone well.\" He said the rate increases \u2014 totaling 2.25 percentage points since March \u2014 have \"achieved a much-need deceleration\" regarding growth and specifically demand. In fact, Goldman expects GDP to grow at just a 1% pace over the next four quarters, and that's coming off consecutive declines of 1.6% and 0.9%. Though most economists expect that the National Bureau of Economic Research will not declare the U.S. in recession for the first half of the year, the slow-growth path makes the Fed's balancing act more difficult. On a similar count, Mericle said the Fed's moves have helped narrow the supply-demand gap in the labor market, where there are still nearly two job openings for every available worker. That effort \"has a long way to go,\" he wrote. However, the biggest problem remains stubbornly high inflation. The consumer price index was flat in July but still rose 8.5% from a year ago. Wages are surging at a strong clip, with average hourly earnings up 5.2% from a year ago. Consequently, the Fed's efforts to halt a spiral in which higher prices feed higher wages and perpetuate inflation have \"shown little convincing progress so far,\" Mericle said. \"The bad news is that high inflation is broad-based, measures of the underlying trend are elevated, and business inflation expectations and pricing intentions remain high,\" he added.\n\nDoubts about the Fed's policy path\n\nFighting inflation might require higher rate hikes than the market currently anticipates. Goldman's projection is that the Fed raises benchmark rates by another percentage point before the end of the year, but Mericle acknowledged that there is \"upside risk\" due to \"the recent easing in financial conditions, the robust pace of hiring, and signs of stickiness in wage growth and inflation.\" Indeed, former New York Fed President William Dudley said Monday he thinks the market is underestimating the future path of rate hikes and, consequently, the risks of a hard landing or recession.",

        "text": "The real value of UK workers\u2019 pay continued to fall at the fastest rate for 20 years in June as wage increases were outstripped by soaring inflation amid the cost of living crisis.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said annual growth in average pay, excluding bonuses, strengthened to 4.7% in the three months to June against a backdrop of low unemployment and high job vacancies.\n\nHowever, the real value of workers\u2019 pay packets dropped by 3% \u2013 the fastest decline since comparable records began in 2001 \u2013 after taking account of its preferred measure of inflation.\n\nGrowth in average earnings including bonuses was 5.1%, although also failed to keep pace with the soaring cost of living.\n\nThe latest snapshot showed early signs of a slowdown in hiring demand among employers despite job vacancies remaining close to a record high. The ONS said unemployment rose slightly to 3.8% in the three months to June, while the number of new job openings fell for the first time since summer 2020.\n\nGrowth in employment slowed to 160,000 in the three months to June, well below analysts\u2019 forecasts, suggesting the jobs market is beginning to cool as Britain\u2019s economic performance falters.\n\nRuth Gregory, a senior UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cJune\u2019s labour market figures revealed further evidence that the weaker economy is leading to a slightly less tight labour market.\u201d\n\nThe chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, said the latest figures showed Britain\u2019s jobs market was in a strong position, with unemployment lower than at almost any point in the past 40 years. \u201c[That is] good news in what I know are difficult times for people,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are delivering a \u00a337bn package of help for households through cash grants and tax cuts so people can keep more of what they earn.\u201d\n\nHowever, the figures underlining the unprecedented hit for workers\u2019 pay are likely to add to the pressure on the government and Conservative leadership candidates amid the cost of living crisis.\n\nLabour said the figures showed the Tories had lost control of the economy. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cThis zombie government is offering no solutions to the cost of living crisis.\u201d\n\nInflation as measured by the consumer price index reached 9.4% in July, the highest rate for 40 years. With a fresh increase in energy bills expected this autumn, the Bank of England forecasts inflation to peak above 13%, alongside a long recession as households rein in their spending.\n\nFrances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the figures showed urgent government action was required to support households ahead of a difficult winter. \u201cThey should cancel the increase to the energy price cap. And they must do far more to get pay rising \u2013 starting with boosting the minimum wage this autumn and giving public sector workers a decent pay rise.\u201d\n\nThe pay data revealed a widening gulf between public and private sector workers, with pay in the private sector rising by 5.9% over the past year, more than three times the 1.8% growth rate in the public sector.\n\nAccording to analysis by the accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, the pay of the richest 1% of workers rose by almost four times the rate of the poorest 10th, highlighting how some households are more insulated from the cost of living crisis than others.\n\nThe Resolution Foundation said the scale of the pay squeeze was deeper than official figures suggest, with the real value of average weekly wages falling by the most since the Queen\u2019s silver jubilee in 1977.\n\nNye Cominetti, a senior economist at the thinktank, said: \u201cThis squeeze has come about despite robust pay growth and a lively jobs market, with pay settlements strengthening slightly, and almost a million people moving jobs in the last three months.\u201d\n\n",

        "text": "\u201cWe just went through a period where millions died, so are you going to spend your time at your job if it doesn\u2019t fulfill you?\u201d Ms. Bettis said, summing up gig work\u2019s appeal. \u201cEverybody loves stability, but if the flexibility isn\u2019t there, I don\u2019t think a lot of people are going to go back.\u201d\n\nLabor advocates have long been concerned about businesses that depend on independent contractors, since those workers aren\u2019t entitled to the rights and benefits that come with employee status, like employer contributions to payroll taxes and unemployment insurance. But while the model has gained traction, it has been difficult to pin down how fast the ranks of gig workers are growing.\n\nThe most accurate measure is Internal Revenue Service data on 1099 tax forms \u2014 the freelancers\u2019 counterpart to the W-2 forms filed for employees \u2014 but that is available only to select researchers and released with a lag of several years. At last count, in 2018, a team of economists found that about 1.2 percent of workers with any earnings had at least some income from online platform work. (A Pew survey from 2021 found that the share of all adults with gig income in a 12-month period was about 9 percent.)\n\nThe closest government metric that is more timely comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which asks people whether they count themselves as self-employed. That number rose significantly as a share of the labor force from early 2020 to early this year. But it generally captures people for whom self-employment is the main source of income \u2014 which, for most gig workers, it isn\u2019t. More likely, the bump represents an increase in the number of people working as home improvement contractors and owner-operator truck drivers \u2014 two longtime means of self-employment that surged during the pandemic \u2014 and some white-collar freelancers.\n\nLess comprehensive but more specific data comes from third-party platforms like Steady, which allows nearly six million workers to track their often-variable sources of income and posts incentives from gig platforms to try working for them. From February 2020 to June 2022, Steady recorded a 31 percent increase in the share of workers on the app with 1099 income. More of those were women than men, with particular growth among single mothers. Freelance income per gig worker increased 13 percent.",

        "text": "Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a \"Morning Meeting\" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Tuesday's key moments: We want growth without inflation WMT, HD earnings beats boost retailers Quick mentions: CTRA, DIS, WFC 1. We want growth without inflation Stocks were mixed Tuesday, with tech names keeping a lid on the Nasdaq as bond yields moved higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up for its fifth straight session. West Texas Intermediate crude, the American oil benchmark, fell 2.5%, which bodes well for inflation. Jim Cramer has repeatedly said that he believes oil's peak in June helped cool down inflation in July. While the market and economy have shown promising signs recently, Jim emphasized Tuesday: \"We want growth without inflation. We don't want oil to be too hot.\" 2. WMT, HD earnings beats boost retailers Home Depot (HD) and Walmart (WMT) reported earnings beats before the bell on Tuesday, pushing other retailers' stocks up, including Club holding Costco (COST). While we held positions in both Walmart and Costco earlier this year, we sold off the former after its warnings of excess inventory and the potential impact to its bottom line. Costco, on the other hand, has not faced the same kind of inventory issues. It's also successfully raised prices for some items and held prices steady for others, all while maintaining strong sales. This week is chock-full of other retailers reporting earnings. See a list here . We'll be watching each one as they reveal their financial results, and in turn, provide insights on consumers spending and inflation. 3. Quick mentions: CTRA, DIS, WFC We also have updates on some other Club names. Natural gas soared roughly 5% on Tuesday, spiking to its highest level since late July. This is good news for Club holding Coterra Energy (CTRA), which Jim calls \"the best natural gas company in the country.\" We have reviewed Dan Loeb's recommendations on Disney (DIS), and we believe there's nothing revelatory there. Cost cutting, for example, is something we're sure the company already has on its radar. As for Loeb's urging that Disney spin off ESPN, we believe that while that could be good for the company's bottom-line in the short-term, having a live sports component to its streaming is crucial, especially since it helps differentiate its product from other services like Netflix (NFLX). Banks have been performing well recently, and we believe that the best ones to own right now are Bank of America (BAC) and Club holding Wells Fargo (WFC) for their large deposit bases. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long CTRA, COST, DIS and WFC. See here for a full list of the stocks.) As a subscriber to the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer, you will receive a trade alert before Jim makes a trade. Jim waits 45 minutes after sending a trade alert before buying or selling a stock in his charitable trust's portfolio. If Jim has talked about a stock on CNBC TV, he waits 72 hours after issuing the trade alert before executing the trade.

After all, the monthly import price drop of 1.4% was just the first this year, and the year-over-year increase is still more than 8.8%.\n\nThat news followed reports earlier in the week that both wholesale and retail price increases abated for the month. Producer prices declined 0.5%, and consumer prices including food and fuel were flat, both numbers owing largely to a sharp slide in most of the energy complex.\n\nPeople are noticing: A New York Federal Reserve survey released Monday showed consumers are expecting inflation to stay high but not by as much as previous months. On Friday, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey \u2014 whose ups and downs tend to ride in tandem with prices at the pump \u2014 was higher than expected, though still just off record-low levels hit in June.",

        "text": "There was an amusing interlude during BP\u2019s announcement of bumper profits earlier this month when the chief executive, Bernard Looney, was asked what he planned to do with the \u00a3400 rebate on his energy bill that would arrive courtesy of the cost of living support package that Rishi Sunak, then chancellor, announced in May. Looney appeared unaware that he, like everybody else in the UK, would get the discount automatically from October. It was only later that BP offered the PR-friendly answer that its \u00a34.4m-a-year boss would make a donation to charity.\n\nLooney\u2019s bafflement was understandable. High earners like him (and, indeed, high earners collecting considerably less) obviously don\u2019t need assistance from the state in paying their energy bills this winter. There was no sound economic reason for Sunak to add a universally applied \u00a3400 element to a package that was otherwise rightly concentrated on vulnerable households, meaning those most affected by higher bills.\n\nThat point, bizarrely, seems to have been lost on Sir Keir Starmer. The Labour leader has opted to back the most untargeted form of support this winter \u2013 a plan to freeze the price of energy for all consumers, rich and poor alike, at its current level for six months.\n\nThe idea is popular, we\u2019re told, because three out of four Tory voters support it. In that sense, it may represent smart politics; the next prime minister will be under pressure to adopt chunks of the proposal, including the increase in the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers. But the economics of freezing energy prices for all households, as opposed to only those least able to afford higher prices, makes little sense.\n\nStarmer\u2019s scheme has the virtue of simplicity, it could be argued \u2013 and, yes, the plan is costed if one accepts the \u00a37bn fiddle with the effect of temporarily reduced inflation-related payments on government debt. But a programme that costs \u00a330bn for six months becomes vastly expensive if it has to be repeated for as long as wholesale prices remain high \u2013 a timeframe that is currently unknowable. If the Looney household and others didn\u2019t need Sunak\u2019s \u00a3400 discount, they definitely don\u2019t require the average \u00a31,000 saving that Labour\u2019s proposal would deliver.\n\nMore to the point, artificially holding down prices for everybody undermines the incentive on wealthier households to reduce their energy consumption, an imperative that ought to be front and centre of any national plan to get through the emergency. Starmer is also talking the language of more insulation in homes, but artificially underpricing a scarce resource does nothing to encourage consumers to turn down their boiler settings in the short term, use their spin dryers less, and so on. \u201cSuppressing the price signal is only going to increase the likelihood that we run out of energy this winter,\u201d says one independent energy analyst, Peter Atherton. Exactly right.\n\nOne can argue all day about how to define a high-earning household that doesn\u2019t need support from the public purse, but a means-tested approach of some form still seems the best way to proceed. It would be fairer, more financially sustainable in the long term and more likely to change behaviour. Labour\u2019s plan has got off on the wrong foot; support should be targeted.\n\nHeathrow seems to have redefined success\n\nThe way the Heathrow chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, tells it, imposing a cap on the number of flights at the airport has been a complete triumph. Limiting the number of departing passengers to 100,000 a day since July has delivered fewer last-minute flight cancellations, better take-off punctuality and shorter waits for bags, the airport was boasting only last week.\n\nSo, having bought time to regroup and focus, is Heathrow now in a position to resume a normal schedule in time for the next surge in demand that will arrive with the October half-term holiday? Actually, no. The airport is extending the cap until 29 October for the same reason: that it needs to support \u201cmore reliable and resilient passenger journeys\u201d.\n\nAn extension is probably sensible if Heathrow \u2013 or the ground-handling firms it usually blames during episodes of chaos \u2013 still haven\u2019t got the necessary resources in place. But let\u2019s not miss the wider picture. Being bounced into capping the number of passengers was a spectacular failure of management that flowed from the under-estimation of the speed of the recovery in demand. Taking even longer to fix the problem is not a success.",

        "text": "A weak yen and higher inflation have also weighed on companies. Over the last year, the Japanese currency has lost more than 20 percent of its value against the dollar. While that has been good for exporters \u2014 whose products have grown cheaper for foreign customers \u2014 it has driven up prices of imports, which have already become more expensive because of shortages and supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nWhile inflation in Japan \u2014 at around 2 percent in June \u2014 is still much lower than in many other countries, it has forced some companies to substantially raise prices for the first time in years, potentially dampening demand from consumers accustomed to paying the same amounts year after year.\n\nThe gradual return to normal economic activity produced strong growth in private investment, Monday\u2019s data showed.\n\nThe growth was driven in part by spending to improve companies\u2019 sustainability and digital infrastructure \u2014 efforts strongly promoted by government policies, said Wakaba Kobayashi, an economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research.\n\nStill, it is not clear how long that growth can continue, she said. Among many businesses, \u201cthere is a sense that the global economy is going to continue to decelerate,\u201d she said. The economies of the United States, China and Europe have slowed more rapidly than expected in recent months because of the Ukraine war, inflation and the pandemic.\n\nJapan faces other challenges both at home and abroad. Small- and medium-size enterprises in particular are likely to struggle as pandemic subsidies come to an end and foot traffic to their businesses remains below prepandemic levels.",

        "text": "A Bed Bath & Beyond store is seen on June 29, 2022 in Miami, Florida.\n\nShares of Bed Bath & Beyond skyrocketed more than 70% to an intraday high of $28.04 in midday trading Tuesday amid multiple halts due to volatility. The stock last traded 35% higher.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond shares soared Tuesday as retail traders active on social media piled into the stock, encouraged by news that GameStop Chairman Ryan Cohen placed another bet on the struggling retailer.\n\nInvestors profit from calls when the underlying securities rise in prices. The strike price is where the security can be bought by the option holder, meaning Cohen is betting that Bed Bath & Beyond can rise as high as $80 a share. The stock closed Monday at $16.\n\nA regulatory filing Monday evening showed that Cohen's venture capital firm RC Ventures bought distant out-of-the-money call options on more than 1.6 million Bed Bath & Beyond shares with strike prices between $60 and $80.\n\nThe new purchase grabbed the attention of retail traders on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum. The ticker BBBY became the most popular mention in the chat room Tuesday, according to alternative data provider Quiver Quantitative.\n\nTrading volumes in Bed Bath & Beyond exploded Tuesday with more than 160 million shares changing hands as of noon ET. The company only has about 80 million shares outstanding, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nCohen first revealed he held a nearly 10% stake in Bed Bath & Beyond through RC Ventures in early March. FactSet says his holdings amounted to 11.82% as of late March.\n\nAt the time, the GameStop chairman wrote a letter to Bed Bath's then CEO, Mark Tritton, saying he believed the home goods chain was struggling to reverse market share declines and navigate supply chain woes. He also urged the retailer to consider selling its Buybuy Baby chain.\n\nLater in March, Bed Bath said it struck a deal with the activist's firm to add three people chosen by Cohen to its board of directors, effective immediately.\n\nJust three months later, Bed Bath abruptly replaced Tritton as CEO in June, naming restructuring expert and independent director Sue Gove as his interim successor. This came after the company suffered another quarter of sluggish sales and heavy losses.\n\nNow under Gove, Bed Bath is trying to turn the ailing business around, but analysts remain unsure it will succeed. The company is discontinuing one of the in-house brands created under Tritton, CNBC reported earlier this month, and there could be more to come.\n\nCreating in-house brands for bedding and kitchen accessories was core to Tritton's turnaround plans, which he took from his experience at Target. But he ended up stripping Bed Bath of items that customers were looking for and investing heavily in things that didn't sell as well.",

        "text": "Wholesale prices fell in July for the first time in two years as a plunge in energy prices slowed the pace of inflation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday.\n\nThe producer price index, which gauges the prices received for final demand products, fell 0.5% from June, the first month-over-month decrease since April 2020, the month after Covid-19 was declared a pandemic. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting an increase of 0.2%.\n\nOn an annual basis, the index rose 9.8%, the lowest rate since October 2021. That compares with an 11.3% increase in June and the record 11.7% gain in March.\n\nMost of the decline came from energy, which dropped 9% at the wholesale level and accounted for 80% of the total decline in goods prices, which fell 1.8%. The index for services rose 0.1%.\n\nStripping out food, energy and trade services, PPI increased 0.2% in July, which was less than the expected 0.4% gain. Core PPI rose 5.8% from a year ago.\n\nThe numbers come a day after the consumer price index showed that inflation was flat in July though up 8.5% from a year ago. The easing in the CPI also reflected the slide in energy prices that has seen prices at the pump fall below $4 a gallon after hitting record nominal levels above $5 earlier in the summer.\n\n\"Cooling prices paid by producers portend a further cooling for consumer prices, as producer prices are further up the inflation pipelines,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. \"We expect producer prices to ease as supply chains improve. It could take up to three months for improved supply chains to affect prices for the end consumer.\"\n\nFederal Reserve officials are watching the inflation data closely for clues about where the economy stands after more than a year of wrestling with high inflation.\n\nBefore July's easing, prices had been running at their highest levels in more than 40 years. Supply chain issues, demand imbalances, and high amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus associated with the pandemic had driven the annual CPI rate past 9%, well above the Fed's 2% long-run target.\n\nThis week's data could give the Fed reason to dial back rate increases that have come in successive 0.75 percentage point increments in June and July. Markets are now pricing in a 0.5 percentage point move in September.\n\nA separate Labor Department report Thursday showed that weekly jobless claims totaled 262,000 for the week ended Aug. 6, an increase of 14,000 from the previous week though 2,000 below the estimate.\n\nClaims have been elevated in recent weeks in a sign that a historically tight labor market is shifting. Continuing claims rose 8,000 to 1.43 million.",

        "text": "Global oil prices have dropped amid concerns over weaker growth in the Chinese economy caused by repeated Covid lockdowns and a downturn in the property sector.\n\nA barrel of Brent crude fell by about 5% to below $94 (\u00a378) on Monday, hitting the joint lowest levels since the Russian invasion of Ukraine as traders reacted to weaker figures from the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nChina\u2019s central bank unexpectedly cut interest rates on its key lending facilities for the second time this year after disappointing official growth figures.\n\nFactory output in the country\u2019s industrial sector grew by 3.8% in July from a year earlier, below analysts\u2019 forecasts for growth of 4.6% in a Reuters poll. Retail sales rose by 2.7% from a year ago, again significantly below expectations, as China\u2019s economic recovery from pandemic lockdowns earlier this year showed signs of fizzling out.\n\nChina\u2019s economy narrowly escaped a contraction in the second quarter, hobbled by the lockdown of the commercial hub of Shanghai and a deepening downturn in the property market, as well as persistently weaker levels of consumer spending.\n\nThe country\u2019s property sector, rocked by a mortgage boycott as thousands of homebuyers refuse to keep up with payments on unfinished flats bought off plan, also weakened in July.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Energy traders are also eyeing the potential for a nuclear deal between Iran and western negotiators that could pave the way for an increase in the supply of oil.\n\nThe global oil price has dropped from a peak close to $140 in March, when concerns over supplies from Russia reached their height. However, prices are still historically high as the war in Ukraine continues, at almost 50% above levels seen at the end of 2019.\n\nSoaring energy prices have been the biggest driver of high inflation in the UK and other advanced economies amid the worsening cost of living crisis.\n\nBjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at the Swedish bank SEB, said it was clear that weakness in Chinese oil demand was one of the main reasons why oil prices had fallen back since early June.\n\n\u201cThere is little hope that China will change its Covid-19 stance anytime soon and there is a high risk that Chinese demand weakness persists amid continued rolling lockdowns from month to month,\u201d he said.",

Workers have complained that the company has made its benefits less generous in recent years, though some benefits have improved more recently.\n\nBut Ms. Ryther said she and her colleagues were also concerned that the store, which is in an area where some residents struggle with drug dependency and mental health challenges, appeared not to have protocols or systems in place to handle certain emergencies. She cited a person who came into the store last fall with what appeared to be a gunshot wound and collapsed into her arms.\n\nPolice officers arrived quickly, Ms. Ryther said, but Trader Joe\u2019s did little to address the aftermath, such as explaining to workers what had happened. Several days passed before she was told that she could collect workers\u2019 compensation while taking time off to deal with the trauma, she said.",

        "text": "In this article CMCSA\n\nMark Hoffman, Chairman of CNBC\n\nMark Hoffman, CNBC's president since 2005 and chairman since 2015, announced Tuesday he will step down on Sept. 12. Hoffman is leaving of his own accord. NBCUniversal hired Cesar Conde to oversee NBC News, MSNBC and CNBC in May 2020 to bring more centralized leadership to the group. KC Sullivan will return to replace Hoffman as CNBC's new president. Sullivan has spent the last two years as president and managing director of NBCUniversal's global advertising and partnerships, based in London. Before that, he was president and managing director of CNBC International and CNBC's chief financial officer.\n\nSullivan will return to the U.S. for his new role. Hoffman will stay on as a consultant through the transition, Conde wrote in a note to NBCUniversal employees. \"Mark has overseen the steady continued growth of CNBC as the world's #1 business and money news brand,\" Conde said. \"No business news organization comes close to the reach and influence of CNBC, a true testament to Mark's leadership.\" CNBC is one of NBCUniversal's most consistently profitable assets, even as millions of Americans drop linear cable TV subscriptions each year. Hoffman, 65, has increased profitability at CNBC in 16 of his 17 years running the company. CNBC is set to grow its profitability again in 2022, according to a person familiar with the matter. \"We are in the business of business so it's important to note we've never been more profitable, setting record after record in financial performance, year after year, as we maneuvered through economic cycles, exogenous events and the historic secular change that accompanied the information age,\" Hoffman said in a note to CNBC employees.\n\nHoffman's CNBC tenure\n\nHoffman first joined CNBC in 1997 before leaving in 2001 for a series of leadership positions at local TV stations. He returned to CNBC in 2005 and immediately pushed to acquire 50% equity interests in CNBC Europe and CNBC Asia from Dow Jones, as well as a 25% stake in CNBC World. With financial control over its international properties, Hoffman expanded CNBC's TV reach and turned his attention to growing CNBC's digital business. CNBC.com has grown sixfold in the past six years, with unique monthly readership growing from about 30 million to nearly 200 million.",

        "text": "A shopping cart is seen in a supermarket as inflation affected consumer prices in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., June 10, 2022. Andrew Kelly | Reuters\n\nIf inflation has been the biggest threat to U.S. economic growth, then July's data should provide signs that there's at least some relief in the pipeline. Prices were flat for the month as gauged by the items that the Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks for its consumer price index. That marked the first time the aggregate measure hadn't posted a month-over-month increase since May 2020, when the widely followed index showed a modest decline. Just a month ago, CPI posted its fastest 12-month gain since November 1982, following a trend that helped send economic growth into contraction for the first half of the year, stirring up talk of a recession. But with at least the short-term trend indicating the rate of price increases is abating, economic optimism is perking up.\n\nNo recession, for now\n\n\"The whole recession narrative really needs to be put on a shelf for now,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies. \"I think it's going to be shifting to a stronger-for-longer narrative, which is really supported by a reversal in inflation.\" Markowska, whose forecasts this year have been accurate, sees solid growth in the near term, including a 3% growth rate in the third quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow gauge, which tracks economic data in real time, pointed to a 2.5% growth rate in a Wednesday update, up 1.1 percentage points from its last one on Aug. 4. However, Markowska also expects pressures to intensify in 2023, with a recession likely in the back part of the year. Indeed, there was a little bit for both arguments in the CPI report. Most of the tempering in inflation came because of a fall in energy prices. Gasoline slid 7.7%, the biggest monthly decline since April 2020. Fuel oil tumbled 11% as energy-related commodity prices were off 7.6%.\n\nTransportation services cost increases also came off the boil, with airline fares tumbling 7.8% to reverse a trend that has seen tickets surge 27.7% over the past year. But there were few other signs of inflation declines in the report, with food costs particularly high. The food index, in fact, rose 1.1% on the month, and its 10.9% pace over the past 12 months is the highest since May 1979. That's causing worries at places such as City Harvest, which helps feed needy New Yorkers who have been hit especially hard by price surge that began last year. \"We're seeing many more children come into food pantries,\" said Jilly Stephens, the organization's CEO. \"Food insecurity had been intractable even before the pandemic hit. Now we're seeing even more people turn to food pantries because of the rising prices.\" Stephens said the number of children seeking food assistance about doubled a year after the Covid pandemic hit, and the organization is struggling to keep up. \"We're always optimistic, because we are supported by incredibly generous New Yorkers,\" she said.\n\nPeople keep spending",

        "text": "From 1d ago 14.25 Oil prices fall to lowest level since before Russia invaded Ukraine The latest dip has pushed Brent crude oil, the North Sea benchmark, to a low of $92.78: that is the joint lowest level since before Vladimir Putin ordered the start of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Monday\u2019s steep oil price decline exactly matched the previous post-invasion low, which was reached on 5 August. Brent prices peaked on 7 March at $139.13 when concerns over supplies from Russia reached their height. They have remained above $100 for most of the time since then \u2013 a level rarely seen in history. Brent crude oil futures prices reached their lowest point since 21 February on Monday. Photograph: Refinitiv It is a similar story for West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, which hit a low of $86.82, the lowest since 3 February.\n\n\n\n1d ago 15.22 Closing summary: Poorer UK households to cut back three times more than rich this winter Oil prices are on track for their biggest one-day decline in a fortnight as investors try to work out whether China\u2019s economic weakness will persist \u2013 and cause a drop in demand. Brent crude oil futures prices reached the joint-lowest level since February, while West Texas Intermediate set a new low. Falling energy prices would be a blessing to economies around the world in the short term as they struggle with the political and financial implications of inflation, but $90 for a barrel of oil is still pretty high in historical terms. It is likely to be the poorest households who bear the most pain when bills rise in the winter. In the UK the energy price cap is expected to rise above \u00a34,200 for an average annual bill in January. New analysis by the Resolution Foundation suggests that the poorest fifth of households will have to cut their discretionary spending by more than a fifth to make up for the energy price increase. Even the richest households will have to tighten their belts. Poorer UK households will have to reduce their spending by more than a fifth to pay for energy bills. Photograph: Resolution Foundation That will mean a lot of products and services that are not bought. Little wonder that economists are bracing for recession in the UK and elsewhere \u2013 and little wonder that it is likely to be the key political issue for the contenders to be UK prime minister. The Resolution Foundation\u2019s Mike Brewer, Karl Handscomb, and Jonathan Marshall wrote: This winter, low-income households will have to reduce their spending by three times as much as high-income households in order to afford their energy bills \u2013 a situation that is particularly concerning now that we know energy bills in January-March 2023 are set to be an annualised \u00a34,266, rather than the \u00a32,800 expected earlier this year.

It appears traders across the Atlantic also have their eye on a possible Chinese slowdown. Here are the opening snaps, via Reuters: S&P 500 DOWN 22.85 POINTS, OR 0.53%, AT 4,257.30 AFTER MARKET OPEN\n\nNASDAQ DOWN 50.98 POINTS, OR 0.39%, AT 12,996.20 AFTER MARKET OPEN\n\nDOW JONES DOWN 171.96 POINTS, OR 0.51%, AT 33,589.09 AFTER MARKET OPEN\n\n\n\n1d ago 14.25 Oil prices fall to lowest level since before Russia invaded Ukraine The latest dip has pushed Brent crude oil, the North Sea benchmark, to a low of $92.78: that is the joint lowest level since before Vladimir Putin ordered the start of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Monday\u2019s steep oil price decline exactly matched the previous post-invasion low, which was reached on 5 August. Brent prices peaked on 7 March at $139.13 when concerns over supplies from Russia reached their height. They have remained above $100 for most of the time since then \u2013 a level rarely seen in history. Brent crude oil futures prices reached their lowest point since 21 February on Monday. Photograph: Refinitiv It is a similar story for West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, which hit a low of $86.82, the lowest since 3 February.\n\n\n\n1d ago 13.37 Oil prices down by $5 after weak Chinese data sparks concerns Chinese industrial production was lower than expected by economists in July. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images The latest check-in on oil prices: prices have dropped by as much as $5. That\u2019s a pretty chunky move for a single day (although things can be magnified in mid-August when a lot of traders are lying on beaches, meaning fewer sellers can have an outsized impact). The new low for the day for Brent crude futures prices is $93.03. That is really not far off the nearly six-month low ($92.78) set just before Russia invaded Ukraine. It is 5.1% down, or $5, for the day. A persistent drop in energy prices would be welcome news for households around the world, who are struggling with inflation. However, it remains to be seen whether a durable decline will be delivered. And it should also be noted that the reason for the decline is not exactly a short-term positive: traders are looking at the global economy and thinking about recessions in several of the biggest economies. That was sparked by weak Chinese data earlier this morning: Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, explains: It is becoming quite clear that weakness in Chinese oil demand is one of the main reasons for the steady decline in oil prices since early June. Chinese crude oil imports were below 9m barrels per day in both June and July and oil demand is no higher today than it was in October 2019. There is little hope that China will change its Covid-19 stance anytime soon and there is a high risk that Chinese demand weakness persists amid continued rolling lock-downs from month to month. A normalisation of Chinese oil demand at some point in time will be extremely bullish for oil prices, but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to happen anytime soon.\n\n\n\n1d ago 12.00 Nationwide to pay \u00a31,200 to lower-paid staff as cost of living bonus Nationwide will pay more than 11,000 a bonus to cover increased living costs. Photograph: Maureen McLean/REX/Shutterstock Nationwide Building Society will pay more than 11,000 of its staff \u00a31,200 to help them cope with Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis. The offer will be made to staff making less than \u00a335,000, or about 61% of Nationwide\u2019s workforce of 18,000 people, said Nationwide, a mutual owned by its customers. The building society has already raised pay by 4% earlier this year, but with inflation expected to reach 13% by the Bank of England that would result in a steep real-terms pay cut. A bonus would address some of this pay rise, but with the advantage for the business of not locking in a higher wage bill. The company\u2019s press release makes it very clear the bonus is a \u201cone off\u201d. HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest and the UK arm of Santander have all announced similar bonuses. Debbie Crosbie, Nationwide\u2019s chief executive, said: The months ahead will be worrying for many people and we\u2019re always considering new ways to help our members. But rising prices affect our colleagues too and that\u2019s why we\u2019re providing this additional support.\n\n\n\n1d ago 11.33 Every time you look at oil prices this morning it seems like they have lost more ground. The new low for Brent crude today is $93.54, down $4.60 today or 4.7%. The post-invasion low is $92.78. That\u2019s still 70 cents away, but after today\u2019s drop that suddenly doesn\u2019t look implausible.\n\n\n\n1d ago 11.15 Today\u2019s commodity price sell-off is giving a good case study of the importance of mining and oil companies to the FTSE 100. London\u2019s benchmark index is the only one of Europe\u2019s main markets to have dipped into the red this morning. Europe may have its fair share of old economy stalwarts (compared to the US\u2019s tech-heavy stock benchmarks), but the FTSE 100 is uniquely exposed to commodities among its peers (and that\u2019s even after a giant steel company, Evraz, was suspended because it was owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, who is under UK sanctions). The FTSE 100 was the only major European index in the red on Monday morning. Photograph: Refinitiv\n\n\n\n1d ago 10.52 Oil isn\u2019t the only commodity under pressure. The benchmark LME nickel contract dropped more than 3% this morning, silver is down 2.3%, platinum has fallen 2.6%. That commodity sell-off has dragged back the FTSE 100. It is just about in the red, with miners Antofagasta, Anglo American and Rio Tinto plus supermajor oil companies Shell and BP among the 10 biggest fallers. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at trading platform OANDA, said: The figures from China really are a concern and the authorities have a big job on their hands arresting flagging domestic demand. That doesn\u2019t bode well for oil demand especially when the country remains so committed to zero-Covid. And with cases continuing to rise, the downward pressure on oil prices could intensify. Throw in a deal between the US and Iran and we may be able to wave goodbye to triple-digit oil prices for a while. Of course, it doesn\u2019t matter how close the two are, a deal can never be assumed to be done until it\u2019s signed. If it does get over the line, we could see oil slip below $90 and perhaps even stay there.\n\n\n\n1d ago 10.35 And just like that Brent crude oil prices have dropped by more than a dollar: as I write it\u2019s at $94.67. That\u2019s a $3.40 drop for today, or 3.6%. Oil prices dropped steeply on Monday morning. Photograph: Refinitiv The most obvious cause appears to be jitters caused by China\u2019s weak economic data. A major slowdown would likely drag back demand for oil.\n\n\n\n1d ago 10.22 And here is a reminder of what an energy crisis can do: Kosovo is starting intermittent power cuts because it is too expensive to import energy. \u201cConsumers will have six hours on and two hours off,\u201d a spokesman for Kosovo\u2019s energy distribution company, KEDS, told Reuters. Kosovo relies almost exclusively on coal (which is also very polluting) but consumption of up to 800 megawatts (MW) is far outstripping supply of 500MW. Reuters reports: In a statement on Sunday, KEDS said that it and the country\u2019s transmission system operator, KOSTT, could not afford to import electricity and must rely on domestic production. About 90% of the country\u2019s electricity production is from coal, and the power utility KEK has said it had shut down almost half of its generators for regular maintenance to prepare them for winter.\n\n\n\n1d ago 10.09 Oil prices have dipped further: the price of a barrel of Brent crude for October delivery is now at $96.07 \u2013 $2 down for the day. Prices are near their lowest level since markets reacted to Russia ratcheting up tension with Ukraine ahead of its invasion. The lowest point this month on 5 August was below $93, a level not seen since 21 February, three days before Vladimir Putin ordered the start of the invasion. Oil prices fell near on Monday following surprise weakness in Chinese economic data, remaining near the lowest levels since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Photograph: Refinitiv The price of West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, has also fallen further: futures prices are down 2.3%, or $2.11, to just under $90 per barrel.\n\n\n\n1d ago 09.36 The then UK chancellor Rishi Sunak (now in the race to be prime minister against Liz Truss) told MPs in February that the government\u2019s aim was to make up for half the cost of energy price increases to households. In May, the government updated the support to be worth \u00a324bn. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) lays out the \u201cfive main strands\u201d: \u00a3400 to all households labelled as an \u201cenergy discount\u201d that will be subtracted from energy bills.\n\n\u00a3150 for all households in council tax bands A-D (around 80% of households).\n\n\u00a3650 for any family on means-tested benefits.\n\n\u00a3300 for pensioners on means-tested benefits.\n\n\u00a3150 for those on a disability benefit. That meant that the government was covering about three-quarters of the \u00a333bn increase in energy bills that was expected then, in May. The problem is that costs have continued to surge since then, to the point that bills are expected to more than double from already elevated levels come the winter. The consultancy Cornwall Insights forecasts that bills could rise to \u00a34,266 in January and \u00a34,426 in April before easing somewhat \u2013 but will remain elevated until we see a proper decline in wholesale prices. Given the cap is currently \u00a31,971, it is easy to see how the price of keeping support at the same level starts to stack up.\n\nUpdated at 09.42 BST\n\n2d ago 08.48 Another \u00a312bn needed to keep UK energy bills support at same level, says IFS Mark Sweney The government needs to spend another \u00a312bn to maintain the scale of support pledged to help families cope with the cost of living crisis as the energy prices continue to soar, according to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). The economics thinktank said that the additional funding will be needed to achieve the \u00a324bn package of aid announced in May, largely because the forecast increase in energy prices over the next year has jumped from 95% to 141%. This means that working age benefit claimants are now on course to see their real income fall by \u00a3620 over the year. The IFS says that the government would need to double the current \u00a3650 grant to those on benefits to protect them, as well as help low income pensioners and families in work, at a cost of \u00a35.5bn. Similarly, the cost of maintaining the \u00a3150 council tax rebate and \u00a3400 energy discount will now cost the government another \u00a37bn if it wants to continue to cover around half the increase in costs a typical family will be hit by over the year. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said: As prices of essentials including food, heating and fuel continues to rise, families on low-incomes are facing more uncertainty and pressures. The government is still playing catch up as inflation and the cost of energy continue to spiral upwards. Just achieving what they wanted to achieve back in May will cost an additional \u00a312bn, and a package on that scale will still leave many households much worse off.\n\n\n\n2d ago 08.25 The FTSE 100 has gained 0.3% in the first minutes of trading in this mid-August week, hitting its highest point since early June. The top gainer is RS Group, formerly known as Electrocomponents, amid speculation that it could be in line for a takeover bid. Pharma group AstraZeneca has gained 2.5% after it said that its breast cancer drug Enhertu had shown positive trial results. Elsewhere in Europe stocks are looking positive.

They have overcome boardroom showdowns, investor power struggles and regulatory land mines.\n\nBut this summer, some of them encountered their most threatening opponent yet: multifamily townhouses.\n\nTheir battle took place in one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most exclusive and wealthiest towns: Atherton, Calif., a 4.9-square-mile enclave just north of Stanford University with a population of 7,500. There, tech chief executives and venture capitalists banded together over the specter that more than one home could exist on a single acre of land in the general vicinity of their estates.",

        "text": "Prices that consumers pay for a variety of goods and services rose 8.5% in July from a year ago, a slowing pace from the previous month due largely to a drop in gasoline prices. On a monthly basis, the consumer price index was flat as energy prices broadly declined 4.6% and gasoline fell 7.7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That offset a 1.1% monthly gain in food prices and a 0.5% increase in shelter costs. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting headline CPI to increase 8.7% on an annual basis and 0.2% monthly.\n\nExcluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core CPI rose 5.9% annually and 0.3% monthly, compared with respective estimates of 6.1% and 0.5%.\n\nEven with the lower-than-expected numbers, inflation pressures remained strong. The jump in the food index put the 12-month increase to 10.9%, the fastest pace since May 1979. Butter is up 26.4% over the past year, eggs have surged 38% and coffee is up more than 20%. Despite the monthly drop in the energy index, electricity prices rose 1.6% and were up 15.2% from a year ago. The energy index rose 32.9% from a year ago. Used vehicle prices posted a 0.4% monthly decline, while apparel prices also fell, easing 0.1%, and transportation services were off 0.5% as airline fares fell 1.8% for the month and 7.8% from a year ago. Markets reacted positively to the report, with futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 400 points and government bond yields down sharply. \"Things are moving in the right direction,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies. \"This is the most encouraging report we've had in quite some time.\" The report was good news for workers, who saw a 0.5% monthly increase in real wages. Inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings were still down 3% from a year ago. Shelter costs, which make up about one-third of the CPI weighting, continued to rise and are up 5.7% over the past 12 months.\n\nPeople shop at a grocery store on June 10, 2022 in New York City.

        "text": "The politics of Labour\u2019s plan to freeze energy bills for all households this winter are simple. With Boris Johnson\u2019s government in its death throes and the two candidates to succeed him at loggerheads over what to do, Sir Keir Starmer has come up with proposals that are big, costed and timely. They will put pressure on Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak to come up with something equally ambitious.\n\nThe economics of the package are less clear cut, and have already been attacked by critics on the left and the right.\n\nBroadly, the plan involves freezing the energy price cap at its current level of just under \u00a32,000 a year rather than allowing it to rise in line with global wholesale gas prices. Left unchecked, it is estimated the price cap will rise to more than \u00a33,500 a year in October and to well over \u00a34,000 a year in January.\n\nLabour says the plan would cost just shy of \u00a330bn, although that\u2019s on the assumption that it would apply only for the next six months. There is, however, no guarantee that the energy crisis will be over by next spring, and some analysts believe prices may stay high for years.\n\nGas prices were already rising before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, but the war has pushed the cost of energy sharply higher, and there is no sign of the conflict ending soon. As with the furlough scheme introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic, \u00a330bn may be simply a downpayment on a much bigger bill.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are two issues here: would an expanded windfall tax actually net \u00a38bn, and if it did, would it only do so by disincentivising investment?\n\nLabour says one advantage of its plan is that it will reduce the annual inflation rate, now 9.4%, but projected by the Bank of England to rise above 13% when the new price cap is introduced in October. As Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, points out, inflation will come down in the short term but will rise again once the six-month scheme ends unless global gas prices fall.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of whether support should be targeted rather than provided to all. Wealthy households who could afford to pay higher prices will be treated the same as poorer households who are facing a choice between eating and heating.\n\nThis has obvious political attractions, but an alternative to Labour\u2019s universal plan would have been to use the benefits system to provide help for those who need it, perhaps by increasing the generosity of universal credit. Instead the scheme encourages better-off people to use more energy, which sits oddly with weaning the UK off fossil fuels and the drive to be a net-zero-carbon economy by 2050.\n\nFinally, the proposals are limited to consumers, despite the fact that businesses face painful \u2013 and in some cases ruinous \u2013 increases in their energy bills from October. Small businesses look especially vulnerable.\n\nGiven that there is no immediate prospect of an election, Starmer will not have to implement his proposals and can say Labour\u2019s plan is a short-term response to the cost of living crisis that is looming this winter. In that sense, politics matters more than economics. But it is conceivable that some of what the opposition is calling for will be picked up. Throughout this crisis, ministers have savaged Labour\u2019s plans \u2013 over a windfall tax, for example \u2013 only to steal them later.",

        "text": "Farmers harvest a wheat field near Melitopol in Ukraine. Wheat, soybean, sugar, and corn futures have fallen from their March highs back to prices seen at the start of 2022. Olga Maltseva | Afp | Getty Images\n\nFood prices dropped significantly in July from the previous month, particularly the costs of wheat and vegetable oil, according to the latest figures from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. But the FAO said that while the drop in food prices \"from very high levels\" is \"welcome,\" there are doubts over whether the good news will last. \"Many uncertainties remain, including high fertilizer prices that can impact future production prospects and farmers' livelihoods, a bleak global economic outlook, and currency movements, all of which pose serious strains for global food security,\" FAO chief economist Maximo Torero said in a press release. The FAO food price index, which tracks the monthly change in the global prices of a basket of food commodities, fell 8.6% in July from the month before. In June, the index fell just 2.3% month on month. However, the index in July was still 13.1% higher than July 2021.\n\nPrices in the short term may fall further, if futures are anything to go by. Wheat, soybean, sugar, and corn futures have fallen from their March highs back to prices seen at the start of 2022. For example, the wheat contracts closed at $775.75 per bushel on Friday, down from a 12-year high of $1,294 in March, and around the $758 price set in January.\n\nWhy prices fell\n\nAnalysts cited a mix of both demand and supply reasons for the slide in food prices: Ukraine and Russia's closely watched agreement to resume exports of grain through the Black Sea after months of blockade; better-than-expected crop harvests; a global economic slowdown; and the strong U.S. dollar. Rob Vos, the director of markets, trade and institutions at the International Food Policy Research Institute, pointed to the news that the United States and Australia are set to deliver bumper wheat harvests this year, which will improve supply since shipment from Ukraine and Russia have been curtailed. The higher U.S. dollar also lowers the price of staples, since commodities are priced in U.S. dollars, Vos said. Traders tend to ask for lower nominal dollar prices of commodities when the greenback is expensive. The widely heralded U.N.-backed deal between Ukraine and Russia also helped to cool the market. Ukraine was the world's sixth-biggest wheat exporter in 2021, accounting for 10% of global wheat market share, according to the United Nations. The first shipment of Ukrainian grain \u2014 26,000 tons of maize \u2014 since the invasion left the country's southwestern port of Odesa last Monday.\n\nSkepticism over Ukraine-Russia deal\n\nGlobal skepticism over whether Russia will keep its end of the bargain hangs in the air. Russia fired a missile onto Odesa just hours after the U.N.-brokered deal in late-July. And freight and insurance companies may still think it's too risky to ship grain out of a war zone, Vos said, adding that food prices remain volatile and any new shock can cause more price surges. \"To make a difference it will not be enough to get a few shipments out, but at least 30 or 40 per month to get the existing grains stored in Ukraine out, as well as the produce of the upcoming harvest,\" said Vos. \"To help stabilize markets, the deal will need to hold in full also during the second half of the year since that is the period where Ukraine does most of its exports.\"\n\nEven with the existing agreement, arable Ukrainian land may continue to be destroyed \"for as long as the war continues,\" which will result in even less crop yield next year, Carlos Mera, the head of agri commodities market research at Rabobank, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Europe\" last week. \"Once this [grain] corridor is over, we might see even more price increases going forward,\" Mera said. Consumers could also see further price increases as there is normally a lag of three to nine months before a movement in commodity prices is reflected on supermarket shelves. Then there is the pressure of exporting enough grain as quickly as possible from a war zone. \"It's time that we're working again. I don't see us exporting two [to] five million tons per month out of these Black Sea ports,\" John Rich, the executive chairman of Ukrainian poultry giant Myronivsky Hliboproduct (MHP), told CNBC's \"Capital Connection\" on Monday. \"Hungry people, at the end of the day, get hungry very quickly after a week.\" In a note published earlier this month, credit rating agency Fitch Ratings' analysts wrote that a possible increase in fertilizer prices, which fell recently \u2014 but which are still double that of 2020 \u2014 could cause grain prices to jump again. Russia's restriction of gas supply has led European natural gas prices to spike. Natural gas is a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers. La Nina weather patterns could disrupt grain harvests later this year as well, they added.\n\nAnd the fall in food prices is not all good news. Part of the reason why staples have become cheaper is that traders and investors are pricing in recessionary fears, the analysts said. The global manufacturing purchasing managers' index has been in decline, while the U.S. Federal Reserve seems bent on raising interest rates to curb inflation even if it triggers a recession, the Fitch team wrote.\n\nFood staples",

        "text": "Either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak will become the next prime minister after Tory MPs put them into the final round of the Conservative leadership election. Here we look at how they differ on key areas of policy.\n\nEconomy and cost of living\n\nLiz Truss has said her \u201cfirst port of call\u201d \u2013 for the economy and help with energy bills \u2013 will be tax cuts. She has pledged to reverse the recent national insurance rate rise, which was designed to fund health and social care, to be paid for by fiscal headroom and a delay to paying off debt accrued during the Covid pandemic.\n\nTruss has not ruled out specific help for energy bills, while refusing to set out what this may involve, beyond a suspension of green levies, costing about \u00a3150 a year on the average bill. She has more generally said she dislikes \u201chandouts\u201d and prefers people to keep more of their own money.\n\nA tax cuts-based economic policy would disproportionately help those who are better off and do nothing for pensioners or those out of work. But Truss has insisted her plan for a low tax, low regulation approach would boost economic growth and help everyone in the longer term.\n\nRishi Sunak has promised \u201ca return to traditional Conservative economic values\u201d, a position seen variously as an appeal to instinctive Tory fiscal prudence, or a desire to return to \u201causterity economics\u201d. When challenged with claims he was a \u201chigh-tax chancellor\u201d, he took aim at other candidates offering \u201ccomforting fairytales\u201d rather than face the hard economic reality. He has said he aims to cut taxes but wants to tackle inflation first.\n\nHowever, later in the race to No 10, he promised to scrap VAT on household fuel bills for a year. The handout would be worth \u00a3160 for every household.\n\nSunak has also promised to lower taxes by 20% by the end of the decade, more specifically that he would cut the basic rate of income tax to 16p if the Conservatives are re-elected in 2024.\n\n00:58 Liz Truss: 'My tax cuts will decrease inflation' \u2013 video\n\nClimate\n\nTruss has committed to maintaining the government\u2019s legally binding goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050, but has said she would suspend green energy levies.\n\nShe is backed by the energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, who is relatively strong on renewable energy, and another backer, Vicky Ford, says she was very supportive of Cop26.\n\nSunak would set a new legal target for the UK to be energy independent by 2045 at the latest and has committed to maintaining the government\u2019s legally binding goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and has assured the Tories\u2019 green wing he would protect the environment.\n\nInsiders say Sunak was resistant to spending money on climate measures when he ran the Treasury. He has, however, previously spoken out in support of net zero and made the case for a greener economy.\n\nEducation\n\nTruss has bemoaned the quality of the state school she attended, which critics swiftly pointed out occurred under Conservative governments, and has promised to give everyone \u201cthe same opportunities\u201d so they are \u201cable to know that the town they are born in has opportunity\u201d.\n\nTruss has also said that every student who achieves three A* grades at A-level should be offered an admissions interview at either Oxford or Cambridge.\n\nSunak supporters Nick Gibb and Damian Hinds, both of whom have served as ministers in the Department for Education, laid out Sunak\u2019s approach to schooling in a column in the Times. The education system will be \u201cfocused on excellence and delivering the skills and knowledge needed for the world of tomorrow\u201d, they wrote. He plans to help the best multi-academy trusts to expand, and fulfil a commitment to establish high-quality post-16 specialist free schools outside London and the south-east.\n\nHome affairs\n\nTruss has reportedly said she would attempt to expand the Rwanda removal scheme to countries such as Turkey, and has called it \u201ccompletely moral\u201d.\n\nShe has pledged to bring back national crime targets \u2013 committing to a 20% reduction in murders, other violence and burglaries within two years if she became prime minister.\n\nTruss has also promised to crack down on violence against women and girls. Under her plans, a standalone offence to criminalise street harassment would be introduced alongside a national domestic abuse register, which would include coercive and controlling behaviour and financial abuse.\n\n01:05 Rishi Sunak says Tories must 'make Rwanda policy work' \u2013 video\n\nSunak supports the Rwanda removal scheme, though sources have briefed that he opposed it as chancellor over the \u00a3120m cost. He has promised a \u201ccrackdown on grooming gangs\u201d and has pledged to create a requirement for all police forces to have a ringfenced child sexual exploitation team.\n\nLevelling up\n\nTruss has also committed to continuing the levelling up agenda but added she would do this in a \u201cConservative way\u201d. Commentators have suggested this means a focus on tax cuts and deregulation, rather than high spending and investment.\n\nSunak picked up the endorsement of the Tory Tees valley mayor, Ben Houchen, as well as a host of \u201cred wall\u201d MPs over his levelling up pledges. He has committed to maintaining a cabinet-level secretary of state for levelling up. Houchen said he was encouraged by Sunak\u2019s interest in the levelling up agenda.\n\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday morning at 7am BST\n\nThe NHS\n\nTruss is expected to give more detailed policy announcements on the NHS, but she has said she is \u201ccompletely committed\u201d to government promises for NHS spending.\n\nOne particular area where she faces questions is how she will find money to pay for and tackle the Covid-related NHS backlog given that she has pledged to reverse the national insurance rise introduced to fund this and other costs.\n\nSunak is pledging to create a \u201cvaccines style\u201d taskforce dedicated to tackling NHS backlogs. He plans to eliminate one-year waiting times six months earlier than planned by September 2024, and to get overall numbers falling by next year.\n\nHe is warning of \u201cprivatisation by the back door\u201d as a result of people who are spending money they can\u2019t afford to go private due to the size of waiting lists.\n\nBrexit\n\nTruss has vowed to review all EU laws retained after Brexit by the end of next year, and to scrap or replace those that are deemed to hinder UK growth.\n\nTruss was a remainer in the referendum campaign but has since become a keen convert to Brexit. She has led negotiations with Brussels over subsequent disagreements and is pushing new legislation that would unilaterally rewrite Britain\u2019s post-Brexit commitments to the EU over Northern Ireland.\n\nSunak came out early for Brexit in the run-up to the referendum. He has reportedly backed proposals on the \u201cNorthern Ireland protocol\u201d and, as chancellor, promoted \u201cfreeports\u201d around Britain as one way of benefiting from Brexit. He has committed to a bonfire of EU laws that are \u201cgetting in the way\u201d of British businesses.\n\nImmigration\n\nTruss\u2019s main pitch is ensuring the removal of some asylum seekers to Rwanda goes ahead, and she has pledged to deliver it by reforming the UK\u2019s relationship with the European convention on human rights. The foreign secretary also wants to increase Border Force capacity by 20%, to increase patrols in the Channel and explore \u201call possible turnaround tactics\u201d. An overhauled bill of rights would be used to enshrine these in law.\n\nSunak, despite having served as chancellor for more than two years, has been scathing of the immigration system \u2013 calling it broken and chaotic.\n\nHe has said the UK does not have control over its borders and so pledged to reduce the number of people granted asylum in the UK by changing the definition of who qualifies for it, allow MPs to set an annual cap on the number of refugees accepted each year and pursue further Rwanda-style removal plans with other countries.\n\nHe would also withhold aid from countries that do not receive refused asylum seekers and criminals.\n\nMedia\n\nTruss is also believed to support privatisation of Channel 4, although she has yet to publicly make her position clear. The sale of Channel 4 is strongly supported by the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, who is a vocal Truss supporter.\n\nSunak will proceed with the sale of Channel 4, saying privatisation would help the broadcaster compete with big streaming firms. Plans for privatisation are expected to be ready when parliament returns \u2013 under a new prime minister \u2013 in the autumn.\n\nForeign policy and defence\n\nBefore the leadership race, Truss set out her vision in May of a more assertive G7, which she wanted to be \u201cmore institutionalised\u201d and turned into an \u201ceconomic Nato\u201d that can defend its members from Chinese economic coercion.\n\nAs foreign secretary, she has been at the forefront of Britain\u2019s more hawkish position on Russia, in comparison with Ukraine\u2019s other western allies. She is promising to spend 3% of GDP on defence.\n\nBoth candidates have yet to set out any big new foreign policy positions during the campaign, although Sunak will be eager to shore up his credentials in this area and emphasise his G7 role brokering a minimum global corporation tax rate.\n\nHaving lived and worked in the US, Sunak is regarded as a committed Atlanticist and Eurosceptic. In terms of defence spending, Sunak has expressed opposition to \u201carbitrary targets\u201d.\n\nScotland\n\nTruss, when asked if she would agree to a request for a second Scottish independence referendum under any circumstances, said this week: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThe last referendum in 2014 was described as a once-in-a-generation referendum. We\u2019re now in 2022 \u2013 that is not a generation ago.\u201d\n\nSunak has said he would try to make an \u201cemotional argument for the United Kingdom from the heart, as well as the practical argument for it and demonstrating it\u201d.\n\nHe has promised to rule out a second referendum on Scottish independence. However, in 2017 he said it would be \u201chard\u201d to block a second vote on Scottish independence, and that it should be pushed back until after Brexit.\n\nStrikes\n\nTruss has promised a further crackdown on trade unions, widening restrictions to a significant new number of industries.\n\nTruss said she would legislate for minimum service levels on critical national infrastructure in the first 30 days of government under her leadership. The pledge would go further than the Tories\u2019 2019 policy, which promised a minimum service should operate during transport strikes.\n\nThe new law proposed by Truss would restrict teachers, postal workers and the energy sector. Tailored minimum thresholds, including staffing levels, would be determined with each industry.\n\nWhitehall\n\nTruss has announced a string of reforms of the civil service, which she claims will cut the \u201cbureaucracy and inefficiency\u201d of Whitehall.\n\nThese reforms include the scrapping of civil service roles that focus on diversity and inclusion, and she will cap the median amount of annual leave public sector workers are entitled to, to 25 days. She also says she will defund the paid time off that public sector trade union officials can take to carry out union duties.\n\nSunak has not officially announced any policies regarding Whitehall yet, but in December it was reported that as chancellor, he was drawing up plans to cut tens of thousands of Whitehall jobs.",

        "text": "Their L.N.G. venture at one point looked like a failure. As it turns out, the millions of dollars and years of frustration meant that when Estonia and Finland agreed in April to share the cost of renting an L.N.G. processing vessel and build floating terminals, the preliminary research and development was already done.\n\nIn the months leading up to Russia\u2019s invasion, Mr. Haal said, soaring gas prices had already begun to change the economics of investing in an L.N.G. terminal. Now, his major concern is ensuring that the Estonian government completes the pipeline connection to the national gas network on time.\n\nOver the years, the question of building more L.N.G. facilities \u2014 in addition to the two dozen or so already in Europe \u2014 has been repeatedly debated in ports and capitals. Opponents argued that shipping the chilled, liquefied natural gas was much more expensive than the flow from Russia. The required new infrastructure of port terminals and pipes aroused local opposition. And there was resistance to investing so much money in a fossil fuel that climate agreements had eventually targeted for extinction.\n\nOne of the countries saying no was Europe\u2019s largest economy, Germany, which was getting 55 percent of its gas from Russia.\n\n\u201cThe general overview was that Europe had more L.N.G. capacity than it needs,\u201d said Nina Howell, a partner at the law firm King and Spalding. After the invasion, projects that had not been considered commercially viable, \u201cand probably wouldn\u2019t have made it, then suddenly got government support.\u201d",

Viking's second-quarter regulatory filing, released on Monday, shows that the fund initiated a stake of more than $500 million in AIG . Viking also scooped up more than 1.3 million shares of Elevance Health , bringing its stake in the company formerly known as Anthem to more than $700 million. Additionally, Viking added to positions in Chubb and Centene, which were both among its top 10 holdings at the end of June. The fund run by Andreas Halvorsen had roughly $47 billion in assets under management at the end of December, according to its website. The fund's equity exposure shown in Monday's report totaled nearly $22 billion. In addition to AIG, Viking revealed new stakes in McKesson , Lam Research , Disney and Intuit . The fund also more than doubled its position in Facebook-parent Meta to a stake worth $462 million at the end of June. Viking trimmed some of its top holdings, including cutting nearly a third of its top holding T-Mobile and more than 10% of its stake in Microsoft . Viking closed out several major positions, as well. The largest was Comcast , which was worth roughly $660 million at the end of the first quarter. Deere , Match and Shopify were among the other nine-figure positions that were eliminated. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which includes CNBC.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nThe consumer outlook for inflation decreased significantly in July amid a sharp drop in gas prices and a growing belief that the rapid surges in food and housing also would ebb in the future. The New York Federal Reserve's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations showed that respondents expect inflation to run at a 6.2% pace over the next year and a 3.2% rate for the next three years. While those numbers are still very high by historical standards, they mark a big drop-off from the respective 6.8% and 3.6% results from the June survey. Through June, food prices rose 10.4% over the past year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They are still expected to climb 6.7% over the next 12 months, but that's a decline from the June survey of 2.5 percentage points, the biggest fall in a data series going back to June 2013.\n\nLikewise, respondents see gas prices, which rose 60% over the past year, increasing at just a 1.5% pace over the next year, a slide of 4.2 percentage points from June, the second-biggest monthly decline in the survey's history. The price of regular gas has come down about 67 cents a gallon over the past month though it remains 87 cents higher than a year ago, according to AAA. Commodity prices overall have been falling significantly as well. Finally, home prices are expected to rise 3.5% from June's 4.4%, the lowest projected gain since November 2020. Five-year inflation expectations also slipped, dropping 0.5 percentage point to 2.3%.",

        "text": "Boris Johnson should intervene urgently to start insulating British homes and introduce fiscal policies to reduce bills, as further delay will mean more people face \u201cextreme suffering\u201d this winter as energy bills soar, a former government chief scientific adviser has warned.\n\nDavid King said: \u201cThis could be the worst possible time for the leadership of this country to be simply sitting back. We\u2019re waiting until what? We have an energy crisis right now and we need good leadership. We need alert leadership, leadership that is thinking about this \u2013 and that is missing.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who has vowed to take no major decisions in his remaining time in office, attended a meeting of energy companies last week that had no conclusive outcome, and is now on his second holiday since resigning last month.\n\nKing told the Guardian: \u201cHe is the prime minster. He wanted to stay on, so he must deliver as prime minister. There is no one else who can do that.\u201d\n\nHe called for higher taxes on energy companies, which he said were riding soaring energy prices since the Ukraine invasion for a bonanza, rather than investing or becoming more efficient. \u201cThey are taking bigger and bigger profits, as the prices are so high. That can only mean that they are tying their profits to the price, not the volume they are delivering,\u201d he said.\n\nKing \u2013 a former government chief scientist and UK climate envoy from 2000 to 2007, and as the government\u2019s special representative on climate from 2013 to 2017 he was an adviser to prime ministers and foreign secretaries including Johnson \u2013 said valuable time had been wasted while the government failed to act.\n\nWaiting several more weeks for a new Conservative leader to take the reins of government would only add to the problem, he said. \u201cThere will be extreme suffering, at the lower-paid end of our society,\u201d King warned. \u201cWe need fiscal policies that help people in the lower-paid bracket, that manage the costs of energy.\u201d\n\nHe said home insulation must also be a priority. \u201cInsulating homes is a massive benefit to individuals and the country at large. Home insulation programmes have always been on the back burner for government for such a long time, though the benefits are enormous.\u201d\n\nEven starting now would help people across the country with bills, he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s never too late \u2013 if you start now, we could see good progress before winter.\u201d\n\nKeir Starmer, the Labour leader, will announce new proposals on Monday for how to deal with the UK\u2019s home insulation problem, while calling for the energy bill cap to be retained at its current \u00a31.971, according to a report in the Observer on Sunday.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rishi Sunak, the other leadership hopeful, proposed to cut VAT on energy bills and offer support to bill payers. \u201cThe big beneficiaries of low tax are people who can already afford higher energy prices,\u201d he said.\n\nKing also criticised the government for turning to increased production of oil and gas in the North Sea to lower energy bills, a move he said would do nothing to alleviate high gas prices and would lock in high greenhouse gas emissions for decades.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely the wrong timescale \u2013 it will take 10 or 20 years for new oil and gas projects [started now] to come online,\u201d he warned.\n\nThe Climate Crisis Advisory Group, an international coalition of scientists chaired by King, will publish a report this week arguing that governments do not need to return to fossil fuels in response to rising gas prices and energy shortages.\n\nInternational cooperation, expanding investment in renewable energy as well as pursuing energy efficiency through home insulation and in industries would be enough to limit the energy crisis, the report says. Interest rate rises should also be avoided as that would risk a damaging recession.\n\n\u201cThe remaining global carbon budget of around 400 gigatonnes of CO 2 simply does not allow new fossil fuel expansion,\u201d the report says. \u201cA fossil-fuel rush is simply an unsustainable position and is a big mistake.\u201d\n\nCritics sometimes argue that renewable energy is variable and intermittent \u2013 but King says overhauling energy grids and diversifying clean sources of power would solve this problem.\n\n\u201cOffshore wind is very reliable, as the wind blows a very large percentage of the time from the North Sea,\u201d he added. Hydropower in some areas could be used to store energy in dams for release when wind was low.\n\nNuclear energy also has a part to play, in the UK and around the world, according to King. He said Germany should return to nuclear power, instead of reviving its coal-fired power stations.\n\n\u201cI worry about the fact that the fossil fuel lobby has been amazingly powerful,\u201d in the UK and other countries, King said. Ministers had delayed again a decision on a potential new coalmine in Cumbria, which King warned could be approved by the next prime minister on the \u201cexcuse\u201d of energy security.\n\nIn the US, important climate legislation was passed last week that will provide hundreds of billions of dollars in funding to key technologies, but owing to pressure from the fossil fuel lobby it still contains sops to gas and oil production. \u201cThe power of the fossil-fuel lobby has been such that the US has never been able to play a leading role in negotiations on the climate,\u201d King said.",

        "text": "\u201cOn the surface, this is good news for the Fed,\u201d said Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights. \u201cThis is the first baby step toward the moderation they want to see on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nInflation F.A.Q. Card 1 of 5 Inflation F.A.Q. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. Inflation F.A.Q. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Inflation F.A.Q. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. Inflation F.A.Q. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Inflation F.A.Q. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFed officials remain committed to wrestling America\u2019s rapid inflation lower, and they have raised interest rates at the quickest pace since the 1980s to try to slow the economy and bring supply and demand into balance \u2014 making supersize rate moves of three-quarters of a percentage point at each of their past two meetings. Another big adjustment will be up for debate at their next meeting in September, policymakers have said.\n\nBut investors interpreted July\u2019s unexpectedly pronounced inflation slowdown as a sign that policymakers could take a gentler route, raising rates a half-point next month. Stocks soared more than 2 percent on Wednesday, as Wall Street bet that the Fed might become less aggressive, which would decrease the chances that it would plunge the economy into a recession.\n\n\u201cIt was as good as the markets and the Fed could have hoped for from this report,\u201d said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies. \u201cI do think it removes the urgency for the Fed.\u201d\n\nStill, officials who spoke on Wednesday remained cautious about inflation. Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, called the report the \u201cfirst hint\u201d of a move in the right direction, while Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that it was \u201cpositive\u201d but that price increases remained \u201cunacceptably high.\u201d\n\nPolicymakers have been hoping for more than a year that price increases will begin to cool, only to have those expectations repeatedly dashed. Supply chain issues have made goods more expensive, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sent commodity prices soaring, a shortage of workers pushed wages and service prices higher and a dearth of housing has fueled rising rents.",

        "text": "Post Office has attributed the record amount for personal cash withdrawals at its 11,500 branches to more staycations in the U.K. and people using cash to manage their budgets. Gannet77 | Getty Images\n\nBritain's Post Office, which offers banking services as well as mail, handled a record \u00a3801 million ($967 million) in personal cash withdrawals in July. In total, more than \u00a33.3 billion in cash was withdrawn and deposited over the Post Office's counters \u2014 the first time the amount has crossed the \u00a33.3 billion threshold in its 360-year history. Personal cash withdrawals were up almost 8% month on month at \u00a3744 in June, and up over 20% from a year ago to \u00a3665 million in July.\n\nStaycations and budgeting\n\nThe spike in cash use is down to several factors. \"Firstly, more people use cash when they go on staycation, secondly, the Post Office helped to hand out support to energy customers in the form of cash, and thirdly, people are using it as a budgeting method,\" said Laura Suter, head of finance at AJ Bell. The Post Office research found that 71% of Brits planning to go on holiday in the U.K. this year intend to take out cash before doing so. Of those who have holidayed in the U.K. in the last five years, almost a third admitted to being caught out by not having cash on them. In July, the Post Office processed more than 600,000 cash payouts for people eligible for energy bill support from the British government. That came to around \u00a390 million and allowed people to pay energy bills, top up gas and electricity meters or use cash for easier budgeting. In total, \u00a33.31 billion in cash deposits and withdrawals were processed at the Post Office in July, \u00a3100 million higher than in June. The data comes as the country continues to grapple with rising inflation. The Bank of England expects headline inflation to peak at 13.3% in October and to remain at elevated levels throughout much of 2023.\n\nIs it here to stay?",

        "text": "Reading and watching the media over the past year, you might be forgiven for thinking that we are facing the collapse of civilisation. We have a shrinking economy, a fuel crisis that may bring on energy rationing and forced blackouts, extreme weather events, the increased chance of nuclear war, and risk of the growth of a new pandemic riding on the back of the last. The Doomsday Clock \u2013 a symbol created by scientists to represent the likelihood of a human-made catastrophe \u2013 places us at just 100 seconds before midnight, the closest we\u2019ve been to Armageddon in the project\u2019s 75-year history.\n\nIn the face of these threats, it may be hard to maintain a rose-tinted view of the future \u2013 unless, that is, you are the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker. In 2018, his book Enlightenment Now argued that our interpretations of news events make us far too gloomy. There has never been a better time to be alive, he said, thanks to the social, economic, political, technological, and medical advances of the past 300 years.\n\nAt the time of its publication, Pinker\u2019s book attracted as much scorn as praise. One common criticism was that he had oversimplified complex subjects and neglected any phenomena that might suggest a lack of progress. Pinker has, however, attempted to address many of the criticisms, and the recent challenges facing the world do not appear to have changed his opinion.\n\nOn Radio 4\u2019s Today programme last week, he revisited the arguments of Enlightenment Now to explain why he believes there are still reasons to remain optimistic in 2022. \u201cWe have to remember that there\u2019s no law of nature that spaces bad things apart,\u201d he said. \u201cBad things happen, and they will appear to come in clusters \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re being punished for our collective sins or that we\u2019re in a uniquely dangerous moment.\u201d He maintains humanity has the tools to deal with the challenges we face.\n\nThere is certainly something comforting about seeing cause for hope in crises. But do we really have good grounds for optimism? To find out, the Observer examines four indices of progress and the ways they have been affected by recent events.\n\nHealth in the time of Covid\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic is the obvious place to start. According to the World Health Organization, more than 6.4 million have so far died of the infection, since the virus emerged. In a sample of 37 countries, the British Medical Journal found all but six had experienced a reduction in life expectancy as a result. That\u2019s not to mention the burden of long Covid, which is thought to affect around two million people in the UK alone.\n\nPinker\u2019s 2018 book Enlightenment Now attracted scorn from some quarters when it was published, but the author continues to defend its message. Photograph: Geoffroy van der Hasselt/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThis is certainly a step backwards for global health. But it is worth noting that Pinker has never claimed that we will see continuous progress without any setbacks. His argument is more concerned with the ways we cope with problems and find potential solutions. Did we deal with the threat better than we would have been able to in years gone by?\n\nThe jury is still out on the UK government\u2019s initial response to the crisis. But the rapid development of Covid vaccines is undoubtedly a triumph of scientific progress. According to a recent study from Imperial College\u2019s Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, the vaccination programme saved at least 14 million people \u2013 and potentially as many as 19.8 million \u2013 in its first year.\n\nThis simply wouldn\u2019t have been possible in years gone by; all previous vaccines had taken at least five years to develop, and at the start of the pandemic many scientists believed the possibility of creating a new one from scratch was naively optimistic. That may be some cause of optimism for our ability to deal with future health threats.\n\nWealth and happiness\n\nOne of Enlightenment Now\u2019s core arguments is that people today are far wealthier than people in previous decades \u2013 and that this has resulted in higher life satisfaction, through greater comfort, more free time and better education. Pinker dismisses the idea that inequality is a driver of unrest \u2013 it is each person\u2019s absolute wealth that matters, he says, which means we do not need to worry too much if much of a country\u2019s gains in GDP go disproportionately to the richest echelons of society.\n\nThe evidence for this is not quite as clearcut as Pinker would claim, however. Recent research by veteran economist Richard Easterlin found that China\u2019s and India\u2019s recent economic growth have done very little for the population\u2019s overall happiness. More comprehensively, a study by Ma\u0142gorzata Mikucka at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium analysed life satisfaction in 46 countries from 1981 to 2012. It found that an increase in GDP only brought about greater happiness if it was accompanied by reduced inequality and increased social capital.\n\nNone of this bodes well for our lives over the next few months and years. The Office for National Statistics has just reported that the UK\u2019s GDP has shrunk in the second quarter of 2022, suggesting that we are on the brink of a recession, while the average salary is set to fall behind inflation by 8% this year \u2013 the biggest drop in real wages in over 100 years. And according to the International Monetary Fund, the cost of living crisis is likely to widen inequality by hitting the poorest homes hardest.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that, by the start of this year, real wages had not fully recovered from the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 suggesting that this is more than a momentary blip in our living standards.\n\nWar and peace\n\nOne of Pinker\u2019s most controversial claims concerns our propensity to kill each other. He first made the case that human violence is at an all-time low in The Better Angels of Our Nature, published in 2011, and then revisited the idea seven years later in Enlightenment Now.\n\nMuch of Pinker\u2019s argument concerns warfare. Using data concerning the sheer number of conflicts, their length, the proportion of lives lost, and the level of military investment, Pinker notes a downward trend across the centuries. Clearly, there are exceptions \u2013 the huge numbers of lives lost in both world wars, for one; you can only reach his conclusion by looking at average numbers across the globe over large time periods.\n\nPinker argues that various forces \u2013 such as the increasing importance of international trade, the rise of democracy, and the actions of institutions such as the UN \u2013 have made war much less desirable for most leaders, pushing us into the period known by some historians as the \u201clong peace\u201d.\n\nThe war in Ukraine challenges Pinker\u2019s view that human society has, historically speaking, entered a \u2018long peace\u2019. Photograph: Anatolii Stepanov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut many other scholars have questioned these conclusions. One analysis by Aaron Clauset at the University of Colorado in Boulder, for example, concluded that the \u201clong peace\u201d may just be a statistical fluke. It is possible for any probabilistic events to cluster in certain periods and to disappear in others. For an analogy, consider how many times you can throw a coin and it lands on tails, despite the probability being 50:50. You might conclude that the coin is biased \u2013 but with more throws the overall frequencies will tend to balance out. According to Clauset\u2019s paper, the \u201clong peace\u201d may be similarly ephemeral.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and growing tensions over Taiwan, have of course placed the thought of global war at the front of everyone\u2019s minds. We can hope that diplomacy will prevent disaster, but optimistic historical analyses provide cold comfort when our fate can depend on the erratic decisions of dictators such as Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe environment\n\nWith the record-breaking heatwaves this year, and the threat of wildfires sweeping across the UK, it feels like we are already witnessing the start of the climate emergency \u2013 and unless we take drastic action, it is only set to worsen.\n\nPinker certainly doesn\u2019t deny climate change, which he acknowledges is a \u201cgargantuan problem\u201d, but he has criticised \u201ceco-pessimism\u201d and the prevalence of what he considers to be alarmist green messaging. In Enlightenment Now, he describes many environmental successes, such as the reduction of water pollution, the elimination of acid rain and a recent deceleration in deforestation. He points to data showing that many countries\u2019 CO 2 emissions are now plateauing. For an escape route from disaster, he points to ideas such as carbon taxing, combined with a reliance on nuclear power and technologies such as carbon capture, which involves scrubbing CO 2 from power stations before it is released and locking it underground.\n\nClimate Change is a gargantuan problem, but the idea it threatens imminent human extinction or destruction of civilization is pernicious. It's not what the science says; it's emotionally destructive; & it discourages action (why bother if we're doomed?) https://t.co/oTybFKUKom \u2014 Steven Pinker (@sapinker) August 23, 2021\n\nNeedless to say, the \u201ceco-pessimists\u201d are unimpressed. Technologies such as carbon capture do offer some promise, but their efficacy is unproven. And we will also require strong political will, which has been far from obvious in the years since Pinker\u2019s book was published. A UN report from 2021 found most governments were \u201cnowhere close to the level of ambition needed to limit climate change to 1.5C and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement\u201d, though it is possible that a drive to reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas could galvanise efforts to switch to renewables.\n\nPinker\u2019s optimism relies on the fact that we \u2013 and our governments \u2013 will act rationally, according to the Enlightenment principles of reason, science and humanism. Our combined brainpower may certainly have the capacity to solve the climate crisis, but to believe that our politicians will take action in time \u2013 that may require a leap of faith.\n\nDavid Robson is the author of The Expectation Effect: How Your Mindset Can Transform Your Life",

Aviation experts said they expect prices to continue to drop into the fall as jet fuel prices and demand ease.\n\nFares peaked in May when many travelers began confirming summer travel plans. After more than two years of exercising caution, many people took longer trips this summer, which is typically the busiest season for air travel. At the same time, many airlines cut the number of flights on their summer schedules to reduce the risk of mass delays and cancellations because of weather and staffing problems especially around holidays and other peak travel days. Fares were also driven up by high labor and fuel costs.",

Those moves were aimed at subduing inflation running at its highest level in more than 40 years.\n\nIn addition to the hikes, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee indicated that \"ongoing increases ... will be appropriate,\" a view Bowman said she endorses.\n\n\"My view is that similarly sized increases should be on the table until we see inflation declining in a consistent, meaningful, and lasting way,\" she added in prepared remarks in Colorado for the Kansas Bankers Association.\n\nBowman's comments are the first from a member of the Board of Governors since the FOMC last week approved the latest rate increase. Over the past week, multiple regional presidents have said they also expect rates to continue to rise aggressively until inflation falls from its current 9.1% annual rate.",

        "text": "In Britain, the year 1976 was marked by three big events \u2013 a summer heatwave, a change of prime minister and a sterling crisis. In 2022, we have had the first and will soon get the second. Few would be entirely surprised if the third arrived by the end of the year.\n\nAs has been the case this year, in the summer of 1976 people enjoyed the sunshine and seemed not to care much about high inflation. According to a 2004 report from the New Economics Foundation thinktank, the UK has never been happier than it was in the year when Denis Howell was made the drought minister, Concorde made its first commercial flight and the Sex Pistols released Anarchy in the UK.\n\nHowever, as the year wore on, the economic problems intensified. James Callaghan, who had taken over as prime minister from Harold Wilson in April, was forced to go to the International Monetary Fund for financial support. An IMF team spent the autumn coming up with a package that involved painful spending cuts. The diaries of Tony Benn, the then energy minister, reveal how split the cabinet was between those who reluctantly supported austerity and those \u2013 such as Benn \u2013 who thought Britain should try to grow its way out of trouble.\n\nThe UK is now less than a month away from getting a new prime minister and for either Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss the challenge looks as daunting as it did for Callaghan. The economy contracted by 0.1% in the second quarter of 2022, which was actually slightly better than expected, but the growth figures do not really capture the fundamental weakness of the economy. A better guide to that are the trade figures, which are truly appalling. As Samuel Tombs, a UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, pointed out, the trade deficit expressed as a percentage of GDP has been bigger in the first six months of 2022 than in any comparable period since quarterly records began in 1955. The position is only going to get worse in the second half of 2022 as the bill for imported gas rises sharply. Sterling looks vulnerable, Tombs says, and he is right.\n\nThe Tory leadership candidate Rishi Sunak campaigns at an event in Bexhill. Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters\n\nThere are plenty of things that might trigger a run on the pound. Inflation could overshoot the Bank of England\u2019s 13% forecast, the recession could arrive sooner and be deeper than expected. Financial markets would react badly to any social unrest that followed October\u2019s increase in the energy price cap. They are also worried about Truss\u2019s hints that she will meddle with the independence of the Bank of England.\n\nIn some ways, the struggle between Truss and Sunak mirrors that between Callaghan and Benn in 1976: one more cautious and the other more radical. With one difference. If the polls are right, this time the radical \u2013 Truss \u2013 is going to win. She aims to revitalise the right in the way Margaret Thatcher did in the 1970s.\n\nTruss\u2019s economic approach seems to owe much to Joseph Schumpeter\n\nThat will prove some task. Thatcher was leader of the opposition in 1976 at a time when postwar social democracy looked to be played out. Her argument that tough action was needed to curb inflation and union power found an echo. The country was ready for a period of austerity, even though in 1976 it had no idea just how tough the austerity would be.\n\nTruss\u2019s economic approach seems to owe much to Joseph Schumpeter, the economist who championed creative destruction as a way of constantly reinvigorating capitalism. To be sure, there is an argument \u2013 strongly made by Edward Chancellor in his new book The Price of Time \u2013 that a prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates has misallocated capital and stifled productivity growth by keeping zombie companies in existence.\n\nBut neither emotionally nor intellectually does Britain seem to be ready for a government that allows \u2013 even encourages \u2013 firms to go bust in their droves. Truss is also swimming against the tide if she thinks this is a country that would prefer cuts in taxation rather than money off their energy bills. The massive package of support provided to sustain the economy through the coronavirus pandemic set a precedent.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nSunak seems more in tune with the public mood but he, too, is an instinctive small-state Conservative trying to come to terms with the fact that this is now big-state Britain. Between 1997 and 2010, when faith in free markets and globalisation was absolute, Britain had a left-of-centre government that struggled to find a way of adapting to the prevailing orthodoxy. Since 2010 it has had a series of rightwing administrations struggling to adapt to a world that \u2013 as far as the economy is concerned \u2013 has been leaning leftwards. In their different ways Theresa May and Boris Johnson understood this, which is why they talked about helping the \u201cjust about managing\u201d and \u201clevelling up\u201d.\n\nDespite the grim outlook for the economy, there is still a possibility that the Conservatives could win a fifth term. Inflation will start to fall rapidly in the second half of next year. Growth and living standards might be rising by 2024. Voters might not be convinced that Labour would be significantly different. The election might be fought on the basis of culture wars rather than the economy.\n\nBut even to get to the stage where it is competitive at the next election, the government has to avoid a full-strength economic crisis. The choice is simple. Provide massive and speedy assistance so people can heat their homes and have a relatively mild recession, or refuse to act and have a monster recession. It is not a question of whether the winter ahead is going to be grim but of just how grim. And, if Truss wins, whether the lady is for turning.",

Mr. Boatwright added that the company had carried out a number of changes to ensure compliance with the law, such as new time-keeping technology, and that Chipotle looked forward to \u201ccontinuing to promote the goals of predictable scheduling and access to work hours for those who want them.\u201d\n\nThe city filed an initial legal complaint in the case, involving a handful of Chipotle stores, in September 2019, then expanded the case last year to include locations across the city. At the time, the city said the company owed workers over $150 million for the scheduling violations alone. Advocates for the workers said civil penalties could far exceed that amount.",

It's a buffered ETF using a risk reversal strategy to minimize downside while also putting a cap on gains.\n\n\"You buy TSLH, hedge Tesla, you get basically 10% on the upside, and you have a 10% floor,\" Bond explained on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" last week. \"Now what a floor is \u2013 that's a max loss of 10%. If Tesla goes down 20%, you lose 10%. If it goes down 50%, you lose 10%.\"\n\nTreasury bills make up about 90% of the hedged fund \"to construct a potential floor against significant losses on a quarterly basis,\" Innovator ETFs reported in the ETF launch news release. \"A call option spread on TSLA using FLEX options\" makes up the remainder of the fund's portfolio.\n\n\"The projected upside cap for the balance of the current calendar quarter (through September) is 8.70%,\" the company also said.\n\nIts floor resets each calendar quarter but will never surpass 10%, Bond explained to CNBC, noting the ETF's floor rested at 9.23% when it launched.\n\nThe Innovator Hedged TSLA Strategy ETF is up 5% since its launch on July 26. Meanwhile, Tesla shares are up 12% in the same time period.\n\nIt's not the first time Bond's company launched an ETF using this risk reversal strategy.\n\nInnovator ETFs started the Innovator Defined Wealth Shield ETF (BALT) last year that focusing the S&P 500 index.\n\nBut the strategy is under fire by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler released a statement not long after addressing risks that may stem from \"complex\" exchange-traded products such as leveraged or inverse ETFs, emphasizing potential issues with their short-term nature.\n\n\"These ETPs, however, can pose risks even to sophisticated investors, and can potentially create system-wide risks by operating in unanticipated ways when markets experience volatility or stress conditions,\" Gensler's Oct. 2021 statement said,\n\nGensler proposed \"potential rulemaking\" to help protect individual investors. However, Bond defended Innovator ETFs' products, suggesting buffers offer significant risk control value.\n\nThe SEC declined to provide a statement.",

        "text": "'We should have an objective definition'\n\nOfficially, the NBER defines a recession as \"a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.\" In fact, the latest quarterly gross domestic product report, which tracks the overall health of the economy, showed a second consecutive contraction this year. Still, if the NBER ultimately declares a recession, it could be months from now, and it will factor in other considerations, as well, such as employment and personal income.\n\nWhat really matters is their paychecks aren't reaching as far. Tomas Philipson former acting chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers\n\nThat puts the country in a gray area, Philipson said. \"Why do we let an academic group decide?\" he said. \"We should have an objective definition, not the opinion of an academic committee.\"\n\nConsumers are behaving like we're in a recession\n\nFor now, consumers should be focusing on energy price shocks and overall inflation, Philipson added. \"That's impacting everyday Americans.\" To that end, the Federal Reserve is making aggressive moves to temper surging inflation, but \"it will take a while for it to work its way through,\" he said.\n\n\"Powell is raising the federal funds rate, and he's leaving himself open to raise it again in September,\" said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, an economics professor at George Washington University and former chief economist at the Labor Department. \"He's saying all the right things.\" However, consumers \"are paying more for gas and food so they have to cut back on other spending,\" Furchtgott-Roth said. \"Negative news continues to mount up,\" she added. \"We are definitely in a recession.\"\n\nWhat comes next: 'The path to a soft landing'\n\nThe direction of the labor market will be key in determining the future state of the economy, both experts said. Decreases in consumption come first, Philipson noted. \"If businesses can't sell as much as they used to because consumers aren't buying as much, then they lay off workers.\"\n\nOn the upside, \"we have twice the number of job openings as unemployed people so employers are not going to be so quick to lay people off,\" according to Furchtgott-Roth. \"That's the path to a soft landing,\" she said.\n\n3 ways to prepare your finances for a recession",

        "text": "Inflation is the top challenge facing small businesses this year, according to a report issued by the National Federation of Independent Businesses this past month, with a whopping 91% admitting that rising prices are having either a \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d impact on their companies.\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce says that nearly seven in 10 small businesses have raised prices to cope with inflation, which is also considered their \u201cdominating challenge\u201d. Sixty-five percent of small business respondents in a Goldman Sachs study said rising input costs have forced them to raise the price of their goods and services this year, with almost 80% saying the economy has gotten worse over the past three months.\n\nIf you\u2019re having inflationary challenges in your business, you\u2019re not alone. However, there is some good news for you. And, unfortunately, some bad news. The good news is that inflation appears to be plateauing.\n\nPrices for core materials such as industrial chemicals, construction supplies, copper, aluminum, plastics, packaging, iron and steel and even agriculture products like fertilizer and processed feeds are either leveling off or not rising quickly. The price of lumber products has dropped significantly from their highs last year. Oil prices are down 30% from earlier this summer.\n\nThis is partly because the world\u2019s supply chain is beginning to show signs of normalcy (port traffic in Long Beach, California, is down to 84 ships off the coast, significantly less than during the pandemic, mass lockdowns in China have ended and the Baltic Dry Index, a key measure of freight costs and shipping demand, has fallen almost 30% since the beginning of the year). There\u2019s also been a general slowdown in the world\u2019s demand for goods which, while not great, has certainly affected prices.\n\nIt\u2019s doubtful whether the Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 regardless of the positive impact it should have on our climate and healthcare problems \u2013 will have much impact on inflation. Penn\u2019s Wharton School says that the bill would actually increase inflation until 2024 and has \u201clow confidence that the legislation will have any impact on inflation\u201d. But the good news is that government spending has significantly decreased and the Fed is no longer pouring fuel on the fire.\n\nThis brings me to the bad news: we are still struggling with rising costs and the situation isn\u2019t going to change any time in the near future. Producer prices \u2013 at 11.3% as of June \u2013 are still up well over historical levels and, because the Producer Price Index is considered a leading indicator, that means that ultimately consumer prices will remain at elevated levels for months to come. It took a year and half for inflation to reach these levels (consumer prices began rising in March 2021 and hit 7% by the end of 2021, well before Russia invaded Ukraine). It\u2019s going to take at least that long for it \u2013 hopefully \u2013 to return to the more sustainable levels we\u2019ve seen in the past. It may take even longer.\n\nThat\u2019s because there are lots of obstacles in the way of significantly taming inflation. Some economists, notably former treasury secretary Larry Summers, believe the Fed\u2019s moves aren\u2019t aggressive enough.\n\nFurther pressure from the Ukraine war could elevate energy and food prices, particularly as we head into the winter months. More Covid cases in China could once again disrupt the supply chain. Even if the world economy begins to grow significantly again in the near future, that growth could put strains on our fragile supply chains and disrupt pricing for many of the core materials we buy.\n\nSo what to do if you\u2019re a small business? You leverage your accounting and customer relationship management systems to stay on top of your product lines, customer profits and margins. You raise prices discriminately and carefully. You communicate frequently with your customers and you expand your relationship with your suppliers. You constantly hunt for other sources of supply. You try to lock in long-term contracts and, like so many big brands, practice \u201cshrink-flation\u201d, where you charge the same price for a little less product. You keep your inventories under control, your overhead low and your cash balances as high as possible.\n\nYou do all of this because, even though it has probably peaked, inflation isn\u2019t going away any time soon. It\u2019s no longer 2012, when rates hovered around 2%. It\u2019s 2022, and you can expect the prices of your core materials to remain significantly elevated for at least the next six to 12 months. My best clients are always planning ahead. So plan for that.",

We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause.

Democrats have faced a bleak outlook heading into the fall, with Mr. Biden suffering from dismal approval numbers amid soaring inflation and painful prices at the pump.\n\nMr. Biden is planning to sign a bill on Wednesday that would expand medical care for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits on military bases, another measure that Congress approved with bipartisan support. And on Friday, the House is expected to pass the climate, health and tax bill that cleared the Senate over the weekend, handing the president a legislative triumph that he and Democratic candidates can highlight in the weeks to come.\n\nThe effort to promote the recent series of victories comes after Mr. Biden was forced to isolate during a bout with Covid-19, followed by a rebound case. He left isolation on Sunday and then traveled on Monday to meet with survivors of the severe flooding in Kentucky, his first work trip since testing positive for the virus on July 21.",

He was 59 years old.\n\nJain, who most recently served as the president of Cantor Fitzgerald, earned an MBA at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and worked at several financial firms, including Merrill Lynch, before moving to Deutsche Bank. He served as co-CEO from 2012 to 2015.\n\nJain stepped down from his role at Deutsche before his contract ended after the bank was beset by a string of regulatory issues.\n\nHis other positions included a role as an advisor at fintech company SoFi from 2016 to 2017 and as a trustee of British charity Chance to Shine.\n\n\"He believed in hard work, meritocracy, operating outside of expectations or conventional boundaries, placing family first, standing by one's roots (having turned away many attempts to Westernize him in an industry that was often homogenous), in speaking 'at the margin' rather than delivering plain facts, in wit and wordplay, in being nonmaterialistic, and in the importance of having broad-bandwidth and being a 'scholar-athlete,'\" his family said in a statement.\n\n\"We are grateful to the many people who cared for Anshu throughout his life. For us, his legacy is tenacity, honour, and love,\" the statement said.\n\nHoward Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, also released a statement about Jain's passing.\n\n\"Anshu was the consummate professional who brought a wealth of experience and wisdom to his role as President. He will be remembered as an extraordinary leader, partner, and dear friend who will be greatly missed by all of us and by all who knew him,\" Lutnick said. \"On behalf of all our partners and employees, we extend our deepest sympathies to Anshu's family and wish them peace and healing during this difficult time.\"\n\nCorrection: This article has been updated to delete a reference to Ajit Jain, who is not related to Anshu Jain.",

Olivier Douliery | AFP | Getty Images\n\nYou'd be hard-pressed now to find a recession in the rearview mirror. What's down the road, though, is another story. There is no historical precedent to indicate that an economy in recession can produce 528,000 jobs in a month, as the U.S. did during July. A 3.5% unemployment rate, tied for the lowest since 1969, is not consistent with contraction. But that doesn't mean there isn't a recession ahead, and, ironically enough, it is the labor market's phenomenal resiliency that could pose the broader economy's biggest long-run danger. The Federal Reserve is trying to ease pressures on a historically tight jobs situation and its rapid wage gains in an effort to control inflation running at its highest level in more than 40 years.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is this gives the Fed additional room to continue to tighten, even if it raises the probability of pushing the economy into recession,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \"It's not going to be an easy task to continue to tighten without negative repercussions for the consumer and the economy.\" Indeed, following the robust job numbers, which included a 5.2% 12-month gain for average hourly earnings, traders accelerated their bets on a more aggressive Fed. As of Friday afternoon, markets were assigning about a 69% chance of the central bank enacting its third straight 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike when it meets again in September, according to CME Group data. So while President Joe Biden celebrated the big jobs number on Friday, a much more unpleasant data point could be on the way next week. The consumer price index, the most widely followed inflation measure, comes out Wednesday, and it's expected to show continued upward pressure even with a sharp drop in gasoline prices in July. That will complicate the central bank's balancing act of using rate increases to temper inflation without tipping the economy into recession. As Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at asset management giant BlackRock, said, the challenge is \"how to execute a 'soft landing' when the economy is coming in hot, and is landing on a runway it has never used before.\" \"Today's print, coming in much stronger than anticipated, complicates the job of a Federal Reserve that seeks to engineer a more temperate employment environment, in keeping with its attempts to moderate current levels of inflation,\" Rieder said in a client note. \"The question though now is how much longer (and higher) will rates have to go before inflation can be brought under control?\"\n\nMore recession signs",

Truss is the insurgent carrying the Thatcherite flame who will put the world to rights.\n\nConsider her six-point plan for growth. It starts, inevitably, with a commitment to cut taxes \u201cnow\u201d. She will \u201cunshackle business from burdensome regulation\u201d buttressed by \u201csupply-side reform\u201d. She will \u201cscrap all EU-derived laws by 2023\u201d and \u201cwork with industry leaders to regulate for British businesses and consumers\u201d. She will \u201ccreate low-tax, low-regulation investment zones\u201d. And she will revisit the Bank of England\u2019s mandate so that it is better at managing inflation. It is ruinous nonsense.\n\nAll the mechanisms to achieve growth are drawn from the evidence-free but prejudice-rich rightwing playbook\n\nReality is not allowed a look-in. There is no recognition that what matters in a decade beset by a pandemic, climate breakdown, fragile energy markets and threats to food supplies is the resilience of a country\u2019s energy, public health, water and farming systems to support business and civil society, in all of which the state has to play a leadership role. There is no comprehension that today\u2019s economy is built on the \u201cintangibles\u201d of knowledge, intellectual property and digitisation for which smart regulation \u2013 not no regulation \u2013 is foundational.\n\nThere is zero acceptance of the role of city regions as growth motors, set out in the government\u2019s own levelling up white paper last December, and the vital institutions and processes that support great cities, again perforce led by the state. As British exports stagnate, there is not a nod to the role of trade as a propellant of growth. The UK, as the second largest exporter of services in the world \u2013 built on intangibles that sit behind sectors as diverse as finance and the creative industries \u2013 is locked out of the country\u2019s largest markets in Europe. It is a growth plan built on sand.\n\nSo, will revoking the remaining national insurance contribution hike (to pay for enlarging public health and social care capacity, recall) and stopping the planned corporation tax rise spur growth, at the same time retaining the four-year freeze on personal allowances, on which Truss is silent?\n\nHere, too, evidence is not allowed a look-in. Successive Tory chancellors \u2013 quasi-socialists in the absurd Truss story \u2013 have cut the UK corporation tax rate from 26% in 2010 to 19% today. Private business investment has remained stubbornly at the bottom of the G7. The key propellant of investment is not the corporation tax rate but the confidence that any investment will pay back, and in strategy-free Britain in the grip of rightwing ideology, cut off from its major market, there is little or no long-term confidence. Truss will forgo much needed tax revenue \u2013 and achieve nothing.\n\nFew directors of British PLCs have a good word for Brexit and the likelihood of trade war over the Northern Ireland protocol in private. The view is shared by the tens of thousands launching startups in an extraordinary entrepreneurial revolution centred around our 100 top universities, ranging from an Oxford that is very different to the one attended by Brexiters in the 1980s to centres of innovation such as Northumbria University.\n\nThe Tory edifice is ignorant about this enterprise revolution. In their terms, these can\u2019t be real entrepreneurs: they vote Labour, Lib Dem and Green, abhor Brexit, worry that the UK is being kicked out of the EU\u2019s Horizon programme, prize universities, want action on climate change and, for the main part, can\u2019t bear the Tory party, its press and freakish leading commentators.\n\nTruss will forgo much needed tax revenue \u2013 and achieve nothing\n\nFor what is shackling them is the lack of a British ecosystem that fosters growing companies \u2013 another deficiency that falls to the state to remedy \u2013 reinforced by trying to put the union jack on regulations and diverge from the regulatory standards in our biggest market. A classic example is the government insisting that the chemical industry should abandon its \u00a3500m-a year membership of the EU chemical regulatory system, which allows it to export to 27 EU countries and become tied to a \u00a32bn UK-only programme, which allows it to trade in one country and not to the highest safety standards. In the 2020s, regulation is a way to guarantee product standards and win market access. Badging regulation British is an expensive means to suppress enterprise.\n\nSupply-side reforms? For Truss, they seem to consist of removing the vestigial remnants of employment protection in the least regulated labour market in the OECD, permitting fracking (a non-starter because Britain\u2019s geology means the risks of damage and subsidence are extraordinarily high) and scrapping incentives to go green. Low-tax, low-regulation zones? As a wealth of evidence shows, these displace economic activity rather than create the new.\n\nDo the Tees Valley or the West Midlands want to become international showcases for industrial injury, tax avoidance and goods that are dangerous or just plain shoddy? As for blaming the Bank of England for inflation of 13%, get a life. If it had acted six to nine months earlier \u2013 which I recall almost no one urging at the time \u2013 inflation might be peaking at 12.5%.\n\nThis is populist bullshit, unless Truss has the chutzpah to raise the inflation target to 4% for a period, an intriguing idea floated by the Bank\u2019s former deputy governor Howard Davies. That is genuine outside-the-box thinking, rather than rehearsing tired Thatcherite nostrums.\n\nAll the while, British households confront energy bills of up to \u00a35,000 next year, unpayable by tens of millions \u2013 another reality ignored by the Truss camp. Truss has become very adept at saying what her audience likes to hear. It is no compass for governing.",

Between those stockpiles and solid wage growth, many have been able to keep spending even as costs climb. But data and anecdotes suggest that lower-income households, despite the resilient job market, are struggling more profoundly with inflation.\n\nThat divergence poses a challenge for the Federal Reserve, which is hoping that higher interest rates will slow consumer spending and ease pressure on prices across the economy. Already, there are signs that poorer families are cutting back. If richer families don\u2019t pull back as much \u2014 if they keep going on vacations, dining out and buying new cars and second homes \u2014 many prices could keep rising. The Fed might need to raise interest rates even more to bring inflation under control, and that could cause a sharper slowdown.\n\nIn that case, poorer families will almost certainly bear the brunt again, because low-wage workers are often the first to lose hours and jobs. The bifurcated economy, and the policy decisions that stem from it, could become a double whammy for them, inflicting higher costs today and unemployment tomorrow.",

        "text": "Luis Alvarez | Digitalvision | Getty Images\n\nEmployers are using signing bonuses at an elevated rate to attract talent \u2014 and there are ways workers can capitalize on the trend. A signing bonus is a financial sweetener \u2014 often a lump sum of cash \u2014 that businesses offer prospective hires. Offers vary widely by company and position, and they can be quite generous. For example, Walgreens is offering a $75,000 signing bonus to pharmacists in some areas to reduce staffing shortages, according to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal. More from Personal Finance:\n\n5 ways to avoid debt collection scams\n\nTop tips to save on back to school shopping\n\nInflation Reduction Act extends $7,500 tax credit for electric cars In July, 5.2% of all job postings advertised a signing bonus, a slightly lesser share than the 5.5% peak in December but still about triple the level in July 2019, according to an analysis of internal data by career site Indeed. That suggests employers are competing to fill open jobs at a time when workers are still \"in the driver's seat,\" according to AnnElizabeth Konkel, an economist at Indeed. \"If employers could find workers a dime a dozen, I don't think they'd be using signing bonuses in this way,\" Konkel said.\n\n8 job sectors advertising the most signing bonuses\n\nThe trend is more prevalent among in-person health-care jobs, like nursing, dental, medical technicians, physicians and surgeons, and home health care, according to Indeed data. More than 10% of jobs ads in these respective categories offered a signing-bonus benefit in July. For example, the share of job listings advertising these bonuses jumped from 6% to 18% in the three years from July 2019 to July 2021, according to Indeed. Here are the top eight occupational sectors that advertised a signing bonus in July 2022, according to Indeed. Nursing: 18.1% of all job listings Driving: 15.1% Dental: 14.7% Veterinary: 13.5% Medical technician: 12.6% Physicians and surgeons: 11.4% Childcare: 11.3% Personal care and home health: 11.3%\n\n'Demand for workers is still going strong'\n\nWorkers have enjoyed the benefits of strong labor market since early 2021, when businesses were ramping up hiring as they re-opened more broadly after a pandemic-era lull. Job openings soared to record highs and wages grew at the fastest pace in decades, incentivizing employees to quit in record numbers and find better-quality or higher-paying work elsewhere.\n\nWorkers have the ability to negotiate whatever they choose to negotiate. AnnElizabeth Konkel economist at Indeed\n\nDespite cooling in recent months, the trend known as the Great Resignation or the Great Reshuffle remains in full swing, according to labor economists. Though surveys suggest some workers later regretted their decision if their new gig didn't live up to expectations, for example. The July jobs report issued last week beat expectations and the U.S. unemployment rate has fallen back to its pre-pandemic level, which had been the lowest since 1969. \"Demand for workers is still going strong, so workers have the ability to negotiate whatever they choose to negotiate,\" Konkel said. \"Maybe that's a signing bonus, maybe that's asking for a higher hourly wage, maybe that's flexibility, maybe that's a particular benefit.\"\n\nNegotiating a signing bonus: 'Make them love you'\n\nLjubaphoto | E+ | Getty Images\n\nThere are a few ways workers can think about negotiating a signing bonus \u2014 or a better offer if one is already on the table. First, think about the money you may be leaving on the table at your current employer, according to Mandi Woodruff-Santos, a career and money coach. She has estimated that negotiating signing bonuses added $160,000 to her income over a 10-year period. That category might include unvested 401(k) match funds or stock options \u2014 money that isn't yet yours but would be if you stayed at your current job. It may also include tuition reimbursement or a signing bonus your current employer paid, but which you'd have to pay back if you don't meet certain contractual obligations such as employment duration. Add this all up, and you can use this sum to negotiate for a signing bonus of that amount with a prospective employer, said Woodruff-Santos, who founded MandiMoney Makers, a group coaching community for women of color.",

        "text": "Rewind to this time last year and the UK economy was accelerating out of the biggest slump in 300 years. The year-on-year growth rate was 8.7% and there was a sense that the worst of the pandemic was over.\n\nChina had reopened its doors to the world and inflation was falling as commodity prices \u2013 from copper and oil to wheat and timber \u2013 began to tumble.\n\nThis week the outlook is very different, reflecting the high cost of the war ravaging Ukraine and the supply chain blockages that can be traced back to China\u2019s return to sporadic lockdowns of industrial centres and ports, blocking global supply chains.\n\nOfficial figures on Friday showed the UK economy contracted by 0.1% in the three months to June, and the Bank of England expects a long recession to begin in October.\n\nPart of the decline was attributed to the two bank holidays that denied employers the usual number of working days in June. The Bank of England believes the jubilee bank holidays were significant and will be offset by a symmetric bounceback in the third quarter, before a downturn gets fully under way.\n\nData on the state of the labour market, inflation and retail sales will appear over the coming days and is expected to confirm the Bank\u2019s view that economic output at the moment is flat, and that a full-blown recession will start later in the year.\n\nThe prospect of energy bills increasing further could prompt some older workers to head back to the office and factory floor\n\nOn Tuesday, job figures are expected to show that a shortage of workers has kept the labour market tight. Unemployment will remain low and vacancies will stay near record highs. Wage growth is forecast by City analysts to have stabilised since May at 6.2%, including bonuses.\n\nThe government will attempt to cast these figures as good news that reveals how government policies have supported employment.\n\nBut the jobs market is still short of about 700,000 workers, many with crucial skills, whom forecasters expected, in assessments made before the pandemic, to be looking for work in 2022.\n\nOlder workers have taken early retirement in droves, while others are still suffering the after-effects of Covid-19. EU workers denied visas have returned home. Younger workers have sought refuge in further and higher education.\n\nThis last group will return \u2013 better qualified \u2013 to seek jobs at some point. What is less clear is how many older workers will want to fill vacancies. Some analysts expect that a jump in the consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation will encourage them to look for work.\n\nWhile the CPI is forecast to remain below double figures in data out on Wednesday, Threadneedle Street officials have predicted that it will soar to 13% in October, eating further into disposable incomes.\n\nThe prospect of energy bills, which underpin the rise in CPI, increasing further in January and April next year, is another factor that could prompt some older workers to head back to the office and factory floor.\n\nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, says a mass return to work is likely to take the pressure off pay. Increases, including bonuses, have already fallen for two consecutive months from 7% to 6.2%.\n\nPay settlements, mostly agreed by large employers, are another indication that wage rises remain subdued. The median settlement held steady at 4% in June, according to XpertHR, while the permanent staff salaries balance \u2013 which offsets those firms offering higher salaries against those offering lower ones \u2013 fell from May to June and then to an 11-month low in July.\n\n\u201cThese developments should reassure the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) that wage growth is unlikely to get out of hand later this year, even as CPI inflation continues to rise. As a result, we continue to expect the MPC to raise the base rate by 0.25 percentage points, rather than 0.5 percentage points, next month,\u201d Tombs said.\n\nHe is one of several analysts to predict that falling living standards will encourage more people who have quit the labour market during the pandemic to take a job.\n\nIf this scenario plays out, there will be less pressure on Bank policymakers to raise interest rates next year. This won\u2019t mean we can recreate last years\u2019 optimism, but the recession could be shallower than expected.",

But it is hard for businesses to know which.\n\n\u201cI think businesses are correct that the current state of the economy can\u2019t really hold \u2014 something has to give,\u201d Mr. Ozimek said.\n\nTo most people, of course, this doesn\u2019t feel like a boom. Measures of consumer confidence are at record lows, and Americans overwhelmingly say they are dissatisfied with the economy. That perception is grounded in reality: High inflation is eroding \u2014 and in some cases erasing \u2014 the benefits of a strong job market for many workers. Hourly earnings, adjusted for inflation, are falling at their fastest pace in decades.\n\n\u201cI know people will hear today\u2019s extraordinary jobs report and say they don\u2019t see it, they don\u2019t feel it in their own lives,\u201d President Biden said Friday. \u201cI know how hard it is. I know it\u2019s hard to feel good about job creation when you already have a job and you\u2019re dealing with rising prices \u2014 food and gas and so much more. I get it.\u201d\n\nTara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University, said the United States wasn\u2019t experiencing a true boom. That would imply a virtuous circle, in which prosperity begets investment, which begets more prosperity and makes the economy more productive in the long term \u2014 a rising tide that lifts all boats.\n\nInstead, the lingering disruptions of the pandemic, uncertainty over what the post-Covid economy will look like and fears of a recession have made businesses reluctant to make bets on the future. Business investment fell in the most recent quarter. Employers are hiring, but they are leaning heavily on one-time bonuses rather than permanent pay increases.",

        "text": "Hiring in July was far better than expected, defying multiple other signs that the economic recovery is losing steam, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.\n\nNonfarm payrolls rose 528,000 for the month and the unemployment rate was 3.5%, easily topping the Dow Jones estimates of 258,000 and 3.6%, respectively. The unemployment rate is now back to its pre-pandemic level and tied for the lowest since 1969, though the rate for Blacks rose 0.2 percentage point to 6%.\n\nWage growth also surged higher, as average hourly earnings jumped 0.5% for the month and 5.2% from the same time a year ago. Those numbers add fuel to an inflation picture that already has consumer prices rising at their fastest rate since the early 1980s. The Dow Jones estimate was for a 0.3% monthly gain and 4.9% annual increase.\n\nMore broadly, though, the report showed the labor market remains strong despite other signs of economic weakness.\n\n\"There's no way to take the other side of this. There's not a lot of, 'Yeah, but,' other than it's not positive from a market or Fed perspective,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. \"For the economy, this is good news.\"\n\nMarkets initially reacted negatively to the report as traders anticipated a strong counter move from a Federal Reserve looking to cool the economy and in particular a heated labor market. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day positive, rising about 74 points following a day of choppy trading.\n\nLeisure and hospitality led the way in job gains with 96,000, though the industry is still 1.2 million workers shy of its pre-pandemic level.\n\nProfessional and business services was next with 89,000. Health care added 70,000 and government payrolls grew 57,000. Goods-producing industries also posted solid gains, with construction up 32,000 and manufacturing adding 30,000.\n\nRetail jobs increased by 22,000, despite repeated warnings from executives at Walmart, Target and elsewhere that consumer demand is shifting.\n\nA more encompassing view of unemployment that includes those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons as well as discouraged workers not looking for jobs was unchanged at 6.7%.",

        "text": "The Bank of England, which has been criticised for underestimating the threat of rising inflation, last year paid out bonuses to its staff amounting to more than \u00a323m, the Observer can reveal.\n\nThis bonus pot was at its highest level for at least two years, with more than 4,260 employees receiving performance awards. Andrew Bailey, the bank\u2019s governor, was widely criticised earlier this year after telling Britain\u2019s workers that they should not be asking for big pay rises because inflation had to be kept under control.\n\nThe bank is tasked by the government with hitting an inflation target of 2%, but the current rate stands at 9.4%. Lord Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at Sheffield University, said: \u201cBonuses should only be paid for extraordinary performance, but there is no evidence the bank has delivered even an ordinary performance. They are unjustified.\u201d\n\nAll employees at the bank, with the exception of Bailey, who was appointed in March 2020, are eligible for a discretionary annual performance award. Bank officials say the vast majority of its employees do not work on monetary policy.\n\nBailey earned a package totalling \u00a3597,592 in the year to the end of February: this included his base salary of \u00a3495,000 and a payment in lieu of pension of \u00a399,000. It was reported earlier this year that he had turned down a 1.5% pay rise.\n\nBonuses should be for extraordinary performance, but there is no evidence the bank has delivered even an ordinary performance Lord Sikka\n\nThe total bonus pot paid to Bank of England staff in 2021/22 was \u00a323,325,265, up from \u00a322,080,732 the previous year.\n\nFigures disclosed to the Observer under freedom of information laws show that 34 members of staff were given awards of between \u00a315,000 and \u00a320,000.\n\nBank officials say the discretionary award budget has been 10% of the total salary bill in the past two financial years, but the number of its employees has increased. Average payouts per person fell from \u00a35,560 in 2020/21 to \u00a35,471 in 2021/22.\n\nThe bank has been criticised by MPs over its handling of inflation. Former Tory Treasury minister Robert Jenrick told the Financial Times in May: \u201cThe BoE missed the opportunity to gain control over inflation last year, arguing that it would be modest and transitory when it was clear to many of us that it would be high and longstanding.\n\n\u201cWe are now in danger of entering a new inflationary era. Having acted too little, too late, there is a risk of overcompensation if it pursues significant further interest rate raises.\u201d\n\nLiz Truss, foreign secretary and frontrunner in the race to become the next prime minister, has said she wants to review the mandate of the Bank of England. Bailey has said it is critically important that central banks maintain their independence.\n\nThe Bank of England declined to comment.",

It is less efficient than simply eliminating deductions or raising the corporate tax rate and could open the door for companies to find new ways to make their income appear lower to reduce their tax bills.\n\nSimilar versions of the idea have been floated by Mr. Biden during his presidential campaign and by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts. They have been promoted as a way to restore fairness to a tax system that has allowed major corporations to dramatically lower their tax bills through deductions and other accounting measures.\n\nAccording to an early estimate from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, the tax would most likely apply to about 150 companies annually, and the bulk of them would be manufacturers. That spurred an outcry from manufacturing companies and Republicans, who have been opposed to any policies that scale back the tax cuts that they enacted five years ago.\n\nAlthough many Democrats acknowledge that the corporate minimum tax was not their first choice of tax hikes, they have embraced it as a political winner. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, shared Joint Committee on Taxation data on Thursday indicating that in 2019, about 100 to 125 corporations reported financial statement income greater than $1 billion, yet their effective tax rates were lower than 5 percent. The average income reported on financial statements to shareholders was nearly $9 billion, but they paid an average effective tax rate of just 1.1 percent.\n\n\u201cCompanies are paying rock-bottom rates while reporting record profits to their shareholders,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.",

        "text": "Despite positive inflation data this week, Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin said Friday that more interest rate increases will be needed to tamp down price pressures.\n\nReleases this week showing that consumer and wholesale price increases softened in July were \"very welcome,\" Barkin told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" in a live interview.\n\n\"So we're happy to see inflation start to move down,\" he added. But he noted that, \"I'd like to see a period of sustained inflation under control, and until we do that I think we're just going to have to continue to move rates into restrictive territory.\"\n\nHeadline consumer prices were flat in July while producer prices declined 0.5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nHowever, that was just one-month's data: CPI still was up 8.5% on a year-over-year basis, and the producer price index climbed 9.8%. Both numbers are still far above the Fed's 2% long-run inflation objective, so Barkin said the central bank needs to keep pushing forward until it achieves its goal.\n\n\"You'd like to see inflation running at our target, which is 2% at the PCE, and I'd like to see it running at our target for a period of time,\" he said. The Fed uses as its preferred gauge the personal consumption expenditures price index; June headline PCE ran at a 6.8% annual rate while core excluding food and energy was at 4.8%.\n\nBarkin's comments reflect those of most Fed officials who have spoken recently about rates.\n\nThe central bank has hiked its benchmark borrowing rate 0.75 percentage point at each of its last two meetings. Markets are divided over whether the Fed will increase by three-quarters of a point in September or scale down to half a point, with traders tilting slightly toward the latter, according to CME Group data Friday morning.\n\nWhichever is the case, Barkin said acting aggressively now is important. He said his constituents are deeply concerned about inflation and want action from the Fed.\n\n\"Consumers really dislike inflation, and one message that I get loud and clear as I wander around my district is, 'we don't like inflation,'\" he said.",

        "text": "LONDON \u2014 The average cost of a pint of beer in the U.K. has soared by 70% since 2008 \u2014 well ahead of inflation \u2014 and some Londoners are parting with as much as \u00a38 ($9.70) for 568ml of the amber nectar. According to figures from consultancy firm CGA, the average cost of a pint has risen from \u00a32.30 in 2008 to \u00a33.95 in 2022, though prices vary drastically across locations. Average prices rose by 15 pence between 2021 and 2022, up almost 4%, one of the largest year-on-year increases since 2008. The average price of a pint at one unnamed pub in London hit an eye-watering \u00a38.06 this year, the highest CGA has ever recorded, while the lowest nationally was a \u00a31.79 average at a pub in Lancashire, in the northwest of England. U.K. inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.4% in June and is expected to rise beyond 13% in October, compounding the country's historic cost-of-living crisis and prompting the Bank of England to implement its largest interest rate hike since 1995 on Thursday. Many pubs and hospitality venues are concerned that consumers will increasingly stay at home. Paul Bolton, client director for GB drinks at CGA, told CNBC that a combination of supply chain issues, staffing shortages, soaring energy costs, lingering pandemic-era debts and generally high inflation are increasing suppliers' cost pressures, which then have to be passed onto the consumer. Raw materials and energy Francois Sonneville, senior beverage analyst at Rabobank, told CNBC that prices are increasing throughout the value chain, starting with barley. \"The barley price has gone up, and has doubled since 2021. There's two reasons for that: one is that the harvest in North America was really poor, driven by a poor climate, so there was not much inventory to start with \u2013 and then, of course, we had the Black Sea region conflict,\" he told CNBC's Arabile Gumede.\n\nA pint of Adnams Ghost Ship Citrus pale Ale. The Suffolk-based brewer says a combination of soaring energy, labor and raw material costs is squeezing businesses and driving up the price of a pint. Geography Photos/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nHistorically, when grain prices increased, farmers would compensate by planting more the following year, but broader agricultural inflation is also putting a squeeze on farms, outpacing even the 40-year high of 9.4% headline inflation in the U.K. \"Where our normal inflation is running at 8, 9%, (agricultural) inflation for our businesses is running somewhere over 22, 23%,\" explained Richard Hirst, owner of Hirst Farms in Suffolk. \"That's a function of obviously oil prices, fuel \u2013 our tractor diesel has gone up more than three times in price, which is a lot more, relatively, than road fuel has gone up.\" Hirst said the farm is also facing substantial labor cost increases, with shortages affecting the farming industry nationwide, along with fertilizer costs. \"Fertilizer costs will have tripled for next year \u2013 we're buying fertilizer now three times what it was last year. Our chemical inputs are going up and just the cost of running machinery, whether it's spare parts or actually just the cost of buying machinery itself. All that has gone up an awful lot more than the 9 or 10% of normal inflation.\"\n\nHowever, barley is not the main cost incurred during the brewing process \u2013 in fact, it only contributes around 5% of the price of beer at the tap. The biggest costs, analysts and business leaders told CNBC, come from labor, packaging and energy. \"I think that if you look at the brewing process itself, it uses a lot of energy \u2013 and the energy price has gone up, as we all know, when we stop at the pump \u2013 but the most important one is probably packaging,\" Sonneville said. \"Packaging makes up about 25 to 30% of the cost price of beer, and glass packaging, glass bottles, use about 25% of their cost in energy, so with gas prices going 10 times higher now than they were two years ago, that has a massive impact on the cost of a brewer.\" Labor of love His comments were echoed by Andy Wood, CEO of Suffolk-based brewery and hospitality business Adnams, who told CNBC that the energy price increases the company is seeing are \"absolutely eye-watering.\" \"Brewing beer or distilling spirits involves a lot of boiling water, so that involves lots of energy to get to that state, although we've put quite a number of innovations in over the years to limit the impact of that,\" he explained. Wood said in the aftermath of Brexit and the pandemic, a tightening of the U.K. labor market is also exerting upward wage pressure, which will likely be exacerbated by the country's escalating cost-of-living crisis. \"The biggest cost that we have is our payroll because the hospitality part of that business is a people-driven business,\" he added. What's more, the geopolitical headwinds facing businesses throughout the supply chain are unlikely to abate any time soon.\n\n\"So we've got Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we've got the energy crisis that that's brought on, we've got the food supply crisis, grain, cooking oils, these types of things, and then \u2026 we hear in the media that China may be looking longingly at Taiwan, so I think the geopolitical situation is getting no easier, so I think these things are here to stay,\" he said. The question for businesses, according to both Wood and Sonneville, is how many of these costs they can absorb, how much should be passed onto consumers, and in the midst of a cost of living crisis, how to sustain margins without forcing the consumer to stay at home and jeopardizing volumes. Brewers tend to have long-term contracts and hedges in place to ensure contingency plans for future price rises, meaning not all of their costs are fully reflected at present, and therefore not immediately passed onto consumers. \"I think if you look at the price of beer that you and I pay, there is a risk that that will go higher, because there is a lagging effect of costs at the brewery because of those long-term contracts,\" Sonneville said on Monday. \"The hope that I think is there at brewers is that prices will come down. We have not seen that in gas \u2014 we've seen more sanctions there and gas prices have actually risen in the last three days \u2014 but we have seen that grain prices have come off a little bit, and the hope is that that will continue.\" Shifting trends Wood noted that consumer sentiment and behavior had already begun to shift in the face of higher prices at the bar. \"We're certainly seeing people come out earlier in the evening, having their drinks, having their dinner, and then they're going back home,\" he said. \"We're seeing people perhaps having two courses rather than three courses, and perhaps having a glass of wine rather than a bottle of wine, so we are seeing some changes in consumer behavior, there is no doubt about that.\" This was reflected in CGA's latest consumer analysis, which found that premium products and venues offering particularly unique experiences were increasing their share of the on-trade.",

        "text": "City bankers are ruining your life again. They just can\u2019t help it. Rescued from collapse in 2008 and force fed a healthy financial diet ever since, the industry is now in fine fettle. And with a deluded display of arrogance only they can muster, bankers have come to see themselves as a force for good, especially in these troubled times.\n\nTheir sizable reserves are largely intact and the hazardous operations that caused so much trouble more than a decade ago are overseen by tough regulators.\n\nUnable to indulge in their usual risky behaviour, they have been allowed to revive one pre-crash habit \u2013 dishing out huge bonuses to their directors, traders, derivatives brokers, marketing executives and pension fund managers.\n\nCity bonuses in February and March this year were the largest in cash terms on record, driving the gap between pay with and without bonuses to its highest-ever level. By the time figures for the year to May came out, total pay including bonuses in finance and insurance was up 13.6%, down only marginally from a peak of 15.4% in the year to March.\n\nThe consultancy CEBR said that a closer look at the figures found that in May, workers in the top 1% of earners, most of them in the financial sector, enjoyed pay packages more than 10% larger than the year before, while those in the bottom 20% received just 1% extra.\n\nThere were some other winners in the race for higher pay, including construction workers, HGV drivers and hospitality workers. But these rises can be attributed to Brexit-related staff shortages, and the increases, while substantial in percentage terms in some cases, are often from a very low base.\n\nBank of England researchers predict average pay growth reaching 5.25% this year, 7.75% points short of its 13% forecast for peak inflation\n\nThe stench of injustice generated by a City bonus culture \u2013 one that shows again how bank profits are considered a private affair while losses are society\u2019s problem \u2013 should trigger a wave of angry protests. However, there is a wider point, and that is the way pay and bonuses in the finance sector have exaggerated average earnings data, apparently tricking policymakers into thinking everyone is enjoying a pay bonanza.\n\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey is guilty of this: he has repeatedly implied that workers are so secure in their jobs now the unemployment rate is down to 3.8% \u2013 its lowest in 40 years \u2013 that they will bid up their wages across the board. He first turned on workers in February when he said there should be \u201cquite clear restraint\u201d in the annual wage-bargaining process between staff and their employers to help prevent an upward spiral in prices. Bailey suffered withering criticism from union leaders, and even a rebuke from an embarrassed No 10, at the time under the Partygate cosh and keen not to upset the electorate any further.\n\nYet that didn\u2019t stop him repeating the message in May, telling MPs that workers should \u201cthink and reflect\u201d before asking for pay rises. He added a plea directed at high earners, who he said should consider the impact of inflation before seeking big increases. He capped his own salary at \u00a3575,000.\n\nUnderstandably, the reference to high pay was laughed at by unions unable to secure higher than a 2% average increase in February \u2013 a figure that has since risen to only 4%. Average pay increases across all industries averaged 4.3% in May, up from 4.2% in April.\n\nBailey defended himself, saying his regional agents had warned of big pay rises coming down the track. Without his calls for restraint, the six consecutive interest rate rises since December might not be enough to head off further rises in inflation, even if energy prices came down.\n\nMaybe the regional agents were focused on some of the UK\u2019s largest employers, who face strikes over pay. Recent ballots by postal workers and railway staff, with nurses to follow, may represent the beginning of a mass pay revolt, but another arm of Bailey\u2019s empire, his research department, predicts average pay growth reaching only 5.25% by the end of this year, 7.75 percentage points short of its 13% forecast for peak inflation.\n\nSo why, when pay growth is low everywhere except the finance industry and businesses affected by Brexit-related staff shortages, are the rest of the population being told their salary increases are so high that borrowing costs must rise?\n\nNot only do higher mortgage costs hit millions of homebuyers, but the effects also bleed into rents, because so many landlords have bought properties with huge loans. Higher borrowing costs will weigh on all household spending and business investment, pushing the economy into a deeper recession than is already on the cards.\n\nDamn those City bankers, and shame on the central bank for ignoring the bad smell under its nose.",
