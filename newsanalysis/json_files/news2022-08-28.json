{"date": ["2022-08-26"], "title": "Here's how Biden's student loan cancellation affects lenders and servicers", "author": ["Jesse Pound"], "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/26/heres-how-bidens-student-loan-cancelation-affects-lenders-and-servicers.html", "content": "The move by President Joe Biden to cancel student debt for millions of Americans has added some wrinkles to the financial businesses that have built up around those loans. The Biden administration announced on Wednesday that up to $10,000 in student debt (or $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients) could be forgiven for borrowers under certain income thresholds. The announcement also said that payments, paused since early 2020, will restart in January. The Department of Education is expected to release more details about the new program in the coming weeks. The exact details will be important to banks, fintech companies and other financial firms that are exposed to the student loan business. Here's an overview of some of the key areas of the market and how the changes could impact the companies and their investors. The refinancing business Because private and refinanced loans are not expected to be subject to forgiveness, and the restart of monthly payments could be a catalyst for many borrowers to explore restructuring their loans, Biden's announcement could be a boon for refinancing businesses. Many fintech companies offer student loan refinancing options. One early winner of the new policy appears to be SoFi . The stock rose 4.5% on Wednesday and got an upgrade to buy at Mizuho . \"Pulling forward the end of the moratorium to [December] can help improve clarity, and may also result in a pull-forward in refi demand in 4Q22, similar to what occurred in late 4Q21. \u2026 With the cap put on income of $125K, those with higher income have little benefit of waiting to re-finance,\" Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev wrote in a note upgrading SoFi. But it is not just fintech companies that benefit from student loan refinancing. Some old-school banks have also reached into that business as well, including Citizens Financial. \"The net pros and cons of [the announcement] actually increases the opportunity for banks on the refi side,\" said Brendan Coughlin, the head of consumer banking at Citizens Financial. \"And so we do expect, in sort of late fourth quarter into the first half of next year, for there to be a decent number of students who have the refi incentive that have recently graduated and are in the money. \u2026 I think there will be a little bit of a burst of activity in the space.\" Other financial institutions can also offer student loan refinancing as part of a personal line of credit. Macro considerations One potential drawback to the refinancing business is rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve's target policy rate was below 2% when the pandemic hit. After being slashed to zero during Covid, the Fed is hiking again, and its benchmark rate is widely expected to be above 3% by the end of the year. That shift means that refinancing may not be as attractive to many borrowers who took out fixed-rate loans when rates and inflation were lower. \"We expect as this new crop of borrowers are going to school and borrowing the Grad PLUS programs at higher interest rates, that as interest rates stabilize and begin to come down, that demand will return. But right now, as I said in my comments, two-thirds of the eligible customer base that we see in the federal loans base, really \u2014 their interest rates on their current loans are below what we can offer,\" Navient CEO John Remondi said on an earnings call last month, according to a FactSet transcript. Navient purchased student loan company Earnest in 2017. BTIG analyst Isaac Boltansky said in a note on Thursday that Biden's move was \"neutral to slightly negative for Navient \u2026 as it marginally reduces the size of the market that can be refinanced in the future\" For Citizens, Coughlin said that the higher rate environment does limit refinancing but should still be an attractive option for borrowers with higher incomes and good credit scores. Additionally, for businesses with other consumer credit businesses beside student loans, the change could affect credit quality for customers. \"Forgiveness could temporarily improve subprime credit quality, but resumption of payments adds to credit deterioration risks in 2023,\" Morgan Stanley economist Sarah Wolfe wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. Coughlin added that the cancellation does raise some questions about borrower behavior going forward now that the government has already trimmed student debt once. \"When you refi to a private student loan, the potential of that [cancellation] benefit doesn't exist anymore, so will students hold back on that hoping the administration does something more aggressive? I think that's highly unlikely, but attitudinally could be something that is in a lot of students' minds,\" Coughlin said. Loan servicers Another piece of the student debt puzzle is the servicing companies. Navient transferred its federal student loan servicing business to Maximus late last year, but does still work with old Family Federal Education Loans. Because many of those loans are privately held, they are not expected to be forgiven, though some borrowers may be able to get those loans reclassified. \"Given the fact that the announcement (at least on its face) appears to be limited to loans owned by the Federal Government (we should get confirmation of this when the details are released over the coming weeks) it has less of an impact on holders of FFELP loans such as Navient or Nelnet ,\" Credit Suisse analyst Moshe Orenbuch said in a note to clients. Nelnet, meanwhile, also services federally held student loans, which generates fee revenue for the firm. Orenbuch said that Biden's announcement could be a \"modest negative\" for Nelnet as borrowers whose full debt is forgiven will be removed from the student loan system. Scott Buchanan, the executive director of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, said that servicers will likely get additional revenue from the government for upgrading their systems to handle the cancellation and other changes to student loan programs, which could help offset the decline of servicing revenue. Nelnet's stock fell roughly 1.2% on Wednesday when Biden's plan was announced, and it is down about 12% for the year. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.", "summary": "The exact details will be important to banks, fintech companies and other financial firms that are exposed to the student loan business.\nMany fintech companies offer student loan refinancing options.\nBut it is not just fintech companies that benefit from student loan refinancing.\nNavient transferred its federal student loan servicing business to Maximus late last year, but does still work with old Family Federal Education Loans.\nScott Buchanan, the executive director of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, said that servicers will likely get additional revenue from the government for upgrading their systems to handle the cancellation and other changes to student loan programs, which could help offset the decline of servicing revenue."},

It\u2019s a Cuban bakery where the loaves are scored with palmetto fronds and reach 36\u201d in custom ovens. Between the longstanding traditions and myths that shape the place, the owners that span four generations have never seen prices rise as they have in the past year.\n\nAcross America, inflation affected the food industry acutely, and in the case of La Segunda, the cost of wheat doubling in just 12 months left a bruise. \u201cThat\u2019s 30% to 40% of our manufacturing,\u201d said Copeland More, a partner alongside his father in the business.\n\nThe jump in cost added nearly $40,000 to overhead each month, and it left More to navigate just how to raise prices, retain customers, and keep the 140 employees across three bakeries above water.\n\nIn Tampa, the cost of living rose at a rate in the past year that dwarfed the rest of the United States, by more than 3%. For Daniel Mitchell, who started working at La Segunda just six months ago as a technician, he felt the pressure.\n\nDaniel Mitchell, a technician for La Segunda Bakery, has felt the pressure of Tampa\u2019s rising cost of living. Photograph: Zack Wittman/The Guardian\n\nHis days just kept stretching. The more time he spent traversing Tampa Bay as a construction contractor, the less troubling the increasing cost of living for his family seemed. But after long days, he\u2019d make it home just in time to tuck his kids into bed and leave before they opened their eyes.\n\nBy the time the pandemic reached Tampa, construction ground to a halt, so he took a second job. Then, he took a third. Twelve hour days bled into fifteen hours. Soon, Mitchell left construction completely to keep pace with the 10% increase in rent and 7% in food alongside childcare.\n\nHis wife, Ciera, who already worked at La Segunda, suggested talking to her manager. She made good on the promise, and Mitchell made good on their faith when they hired him as a maintenance technician. \u201cNow I only have to work one place,\u201d he said and with the regular hours, he gets home in time to see his kids before the sun sets.\n\nStill, although the stress of multiple jobs and long days has ebbed, the cost of living continues to climb, and so the Mitchells have given up eating out and paid careful attention to just how they\u2019re spending their money. \u201cNow it\u2019s more of a necessity, you know what I mean?\u201d Mitchell said, \u201cHolding onto money, saving, because you never know.\u201d\n\nA rise in the cost of living\n\nThe rising cost of everything in Tampa has become as commonplace as the storms that build up on the Gulf\u2019s edge nearly every afternoon in the summer.\n\nAcross the country, the cost of rent, food and housing grew exponentially this past year. Nationally, the cost of inflation hovered around 8% according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nBut along the Gulf of Mexico, Tampa dwarfed the national average, often by three points. While tourism revenues ballooned, low wages stagnated. Insurance rates rose as jobless claims alongside evictions and property taxes edged toward insurmountable for many residents. The region saw some of the fastest growing rents in all of America according to real estate academics \u2013 more than a 30% jump.\n\nCopeland More, owner of La Segunda Bakery, agreed to raise wages when the cost of living began to rise in 2020. Photograph: Zack Wittman/The Guardian\n\nAt La Segunda, when the cost of living began to climb in 2020, More and his managers agreed to raise wages. \u201cWe got ahead of the game,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019ve always had full benefits.\u201d\n\nLike the rest of the country, restaurants shuttered across Tampa Bay, and turnover among employees spread like wildfire. At La Segunda, \u201cWe raised prices on everything,\u201d More said. He feared losing customers, but as the temperature broke 100F (38C) this past month, the line of people waiting outside in Ybor and the humming dining room at their Kennedy location reassured him.\n\nFor La Segunda, bread animates the business, with wholesale to customers around the country making up almost 75% of its revenue. In each shift, the bakers produce between 3,000 and 5,000 loaves by hand.\n\nLa Segunda bakers produce between 3,000 and 5,000 loaves of bread by hand in each shift.

You\u2019re on your feet. It\u2019s hot. It\u2019s manual labor. It\u2019s repetitive labor.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s part of why La Segunda built out a retirement program for its employees that ensured they could retire, take vacation or see a doctor. Many of the bakers are older, and More told them, \u201cYou guys can\u2019t work here forever.\u201d\n\nAt first, everyone was skeptical, but in time they came around to the idea of their wages being set aside. And over the years, More and his family helped employees secure housing or put together the financing to buy a place, but now when he talks to his employees and managers, he said, \u201cHousing costs are outrageous. You basically can\u2019t live unless you\u2019re at this wage. I\u2019m thinking to myself, \u2018It just doesn\u2019t add up.\u2019 You know?\u201d\n\nAll throughout Tampa Bay, the concentration of for sale signs along the road, empty storefronts, and people panhandling at intersections told another story inextricably tied to the city.\n\nLoaves of dough rest in a proofer at La Segunda\u2019s location in Seminole Heights, Florida.

Photograph: Zack Wittman/The Guardian\n\nIn the blue light before the sun even hints at rising, Hernandez and her husband stock the pantry, like playing a careful game of Tetris to make sure everything fits in the limited coolers they have. They started with food, because as Hernandez said, \u201cFood is the door.\u201d She ran through how everybody\u2019s rent in this neighborhood rose in the last year, but wages stayed the same. \u201cYou can only stretch it so much,\u201d she said.\n\nFor some of the families it begins with the inability to afford childcare, a missed day of work, or the sudden jump in rent many saw here. Soon, they\u2019re tiding themselves over in a hotel or a family member\u2019s living room and, as Hernandez explained, people who never imagined themselves standing in line for a food pantry are suddenly there.\n\nIn Tampa Bay, there\u2019s a patchwork of nonprofits devoted to providing aid to families like Hernandez\u2019s, and among the largest is Metropolitan Ministries. For James Dunbar, their senior director of outreach and prevention, he echoed Hernandez\u2019s sentiment when he explained how much broader the spectrum of families affected was.\n\nOf course, the most vulnerable families were still at risk here, but he noted how families that have never needed nor asked for help were standing in line for food or looking for help with rent, diapers, or their mortgage. \u201cNow it\u2019s our neighbors that have never had to ask,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s moving up the chain.\u201d\n\nNancy Hernandez started Pantry Multiplicaci\u00f3n, which just found a storefront in 2021, when she began to see the need in her community.

On Friday, the pantry would open, but it was unclear how many more months they could afford to stay here.\n\nIn June, the landlord, who previously had been extremely flexible and understanding, let Hernandez know that the rent would double come July. The space, previously $1,500, would now cost $3,000 a month. For now, Hernandez focused on finding space for the donations on their way to the pantry, but as the day wore on, she wondered how long they might sustain themselves here, and so, she prayed.\n\nSoraya Aguirre, a volunteer with Pantry Multiplicaci\u00f3n peers out the front door of the pantry.

Brandon Bell | Getty Images\n\nJuly's consumer price index report finally showed a sign of potential relief \u2013 inflation ticked up less than expected from a year ago, and was flat on the month, meaning that a basket of items and services generally stayed the same price. But some items have fallen, on a monthly and weekly basis, potentially signaling that inflation has passed its peak and may be cooling off. This is welcome news to consumers who have been squeezed by higher prices and are looking for any sign of relief. Some of the top items whose prices have come down include eggs, milk and gasoline.\n\n\"Fuel inflation was really big and that's going to have a pretty meaningful impact on consumers and their spending patterns,\" said John Leer, chief economist at Morning Consult. \"I think that's actually a good thing for the economy.\"\n\nGrocery aisle prices down\n\nMany of the items that have declined are tied to food and energy, often the most volatile costs that consumers deal with. Grocery store staples have dipped. Large white eggs cost, on average, $2.14 for a dozen, during the week of Aug. 15-21, according to the USDA. That's a whopping 60 cent drop from the prior week, when the average was $2.74 per dozen.\n\nThe average price for a gallon of milk slipped to $3.16 from $3.24 during the period of Aug. 8-12 from the previous month, and the average price of butter fell to $3.67 from $4.68 in the same timeframe, per USDA data. Chicken breast prices also slipped on a weekly basis during the period of Aug. 8-12, but other parts of the chicken are declining as well \u2013 chicken wing prices have been trending down and are now cost less than they did pre-pandemic, according to data from the Department of Agriculture.\n\nOil pulled down fuel prices\n\nOutside of food, declines can be seen in consumer goods and services related to energy. This is because oil prices are often subject to big price swings as the balance between supply and demand shifts. This year, the war between Russia and Ukraine threw that balance off and the price of oil spiked when countries stopped buying from Russia, a major exporter. However, oil prices have come back down, lowering the cost of energy and particularly gasoline. The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline is $3.918 as of Friday, according to AAA. While that's higher than it was a year ago, it's a solid decline from the $4.495 consumers were paying for gas a month ago, and a sharp drop from the recent high of $5.016 hit in June.\n\nI think consumers increasingly believe that inflation is going to come down. John Leer chief economist at Morning Consult\n\nThat also potentially affected another area of the economy that saw a price dip month over month \u2013 airfares. The average price of a domestic airline ticket has dropped to $295 in August from $332 in July, according to travel site Hopper. That's also back in-line with the average price for a domestic ticket in the same month in 2019. Outside of fuel costs, this dip in ticket prices could be because consumer demand is fading, according to according to Kevin Gordon, a senior investment research manager at Schwab. \"That could be demand destruction,\" he said, adding that the reopening from pandemic lockdowns inflated the price of things as consumers rushed to take vacations again.

But the Fed\u2019s aggressive effort to tame it through steep interest rate hikes \u2013 the fastest series of rate hikes since the early 1980s \u2013 raises the risk of recession. Powell\u2019s remarks signal that the Fed will probably increase rates again in September by another three-quarter of a percent, raising the risk still further.\n\nThe pain is already being felt across the land. Wage gains haven\u2019t kept up with inflation. This means most Americans continue to lose economic ground.\n\nPowell is in effect telling them they\u2019ll lose even more ground. Higher interest rates, he admits, will slow economic growth and result in \u201csofter\u201d labor market conditions \u2013 a euphemism for lower wage increases and fewer jobs. But \u201cthese are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, though, corporate profits continue to soar. Profit margins are at their highest since 1950, according to Commerce Department figures published Thursday.\n\nStop for a moment and let your mind dwell on this: the prices businesses are charging their customers are outpacing whatever increased costs businesses are facing for materials and labor.\n\nIn other words, wages aren\u2019t pushing up inflation. The costs of production aren\u2019t pushing up inflation.\n\nCorporations are pushing up inflation. The biggest single unique source of inflation in the United States is the pricing power of corporations.\n\nSo why is the Fed raising interest rates? Because that\u2019s what the Fed does when prices are rising. That\u2019s the only tool in the Fed\u2019s toolkit. To quote the old saying, when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail \u2013 or, in this case, an interest rate to hike.\n\nThe problem: this mostly burdens working people and the low-income with fighting inflation. They\u2019re the first to lose pay and jobs as the economy slows. They\u2019re already getting hammered.\n\nIf the Fed continues to raise rates to slow inflation, they\u2019ll get hammered even more.\n\nThis might be justifiable if corporations were investing their windfall profits in more productive capacity \u2013 adding factories, materials, warehouses, and jobs \u2013 which would expand their ability to meet future demand and thereby better guarding against inflation.\n\nBut they aren\u2019t. They\u2019re using their profits to buy back their shares of stock so that their share values won\u2019t sag too much further after already sagging due to the anticipated Fed-induced slowdown.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, Goldman Sachs estimated that 2022 would see a record-breaking $1tn in buybacks. That\u2019s unlikely to happen, but buybacks are continuing at a strong pace. In the second quarter, buybacks were up by about 7% over the year before.\n\nSome economists argue that there\u2019s no reason to think corporations would now exert more pricing power than they\u2019ve had all along. Why would they wait for the costs of materials and labor to rise before increasing their profit margins?\n\nThe answer is simple. Inflation gives them cover. They can say \u2013 as many now do \u2013 that they have no choice but to raise prices in light of the rising costs of materials and labor. They\u2019re just not advertising the fact that their profits are rising as they do so.\n\nWhich brings us to the central policy question: why can\u2019t the burden of fighting inflation be placed where it belongs \u2013 on big corporations continuing to raise their prices in pursuit of larger profit margins and higher share prices?\n\nThe simple answer is big corporations have so much political clout that they\u2019d never allow the sorts of policies that would have that effect \u2013 say, a windfall profits tax, price controls, higher taxes on themselves and the wealthy, and bolder and more effective antitrust enforcement.\n\nAlthough the Democrats did pass a 1% percent tax on stock buybacks in the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act, they weren\u2019t able to take these other steps. Not even a Democratic president and Democrats in control of both houses of Congress could overcome vested corporate interests.\n\nSo it\u2019s all on Jerome Powell and the Fed.

The End Fuel Poverty Coalition has warned \"a tsunami of fuel poverty will hit the country this winter.\" Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nLONDON \u2014 Facing soaring energy bills, rising costs and rapidly declining consumer purchasing power, small businesses across the U.K. are struggling to make ends meet. New data on Wednesday showed U.K. inflation jumped to a 40-year high of 10.1% in July as food and energy costs continued to soar, exacerbating the country's cost-of-living crisis. The Bank of England expects consumer price inflation to top out at 13.3% in October, with the country's average energy bills (set via a price cap) expected to rise sharply in the fourth quarter to eventually exceed an annual \u00a34,266 ($5,170) in early 2023. On Wednesday, a director of U.K. energy regulator Ofgem quit over its decision to add hundreds of pounds to household bills, accusing the watchdog of failing to strike the \"right balance between the interests of consumers and the interests of suppliers.\" Real wages in the U.K. fell by an annual 3% in the second quarter of 2022, the sharpest decline on record, as wage increases failed to keep pace with the surging cost of living. A new survey published Friday also showed consumer confidence falling to its lowest level since records began in 1974. 'Absolute madness' \"While the energy price caps do not apply to businesses directly, millions of small business owners are still experiencing increased energy bills at a time when costs are rising in most operational areas,\" said Alan Thomas, U.K. CEO at insurance firm Simply Business. \"Simultaneously, consumer purchasing power is going down as Brits cut back on non-essential spending, harming the books of SME [small and medium-sized enterprise] owners.\" This assessment was echoed by Christopher Gammon, e-commerce manager at Lincs Aquatics \u2014 a Lincolnshire-based store and warehouse providing aquariums, ponds and marine livestock. The business has seen its energy costs rise by 90% so far since the war in Ukraine began, Gammon told CNBC on Thursday, and its owners are provisioning for further increases in the coming months.\n\n\"We are combating the rising cost with switching everything to LED, solar panels, wind turbines (planning in process) and closing down unused systems,\" Gammon said. \"We have also had to increase the price of products \u2014 most of these have been livestock as they are now costing more to look after.\" Customers are increasingly withdrawing from keeping fish and reptiles due to the cost of maintenance, and on Wednesday the store had a customer bring in a snake they could no longer afford to care for. The spiraling costs forced Lincs Aquatics to close a store in East Yorkshire, laying off several workers, while trying to offer pay rises to staff at its two remaining locations in Lincolnshire in order to help them through the crisis. The business is also working to expand its online shop due to rising in-store upkeep costs, as heating water for marine aquariums and purchasing pump equipment become ever more expensive. In early July, a quarterly survey from the British Chambers of Commerce found that 82% of businesses in the U.K. saw inflation as a growing concern for their business, with growth in sales, investment intentions and longer-term turnover confidence all slowing.\n\n\"Businesses face an unprecedented convergence of cost pressures, with the main drivers coming from raw materials, fuel, utilities, taxes, and labor,\" said BCC Head of Research David Bharier. \"The continuing supply chain crisis, exacerbated by conflict in Ukraine and lockdowns in China, has further compounded this.\" BCC Director General Shevaun Haviland added that \"the red lights on our economic dashboard are starting to flash,\" with almost every indicator deteriorating since the March survey. Phil Speed, based in Lincolnshire, England, liaises with brokers to find energy deals for business clients. He told CNBC earlier this week that for the first time in 10 years, he had been unable to obtain a better deal for a client than their out-of-contract rate \u2014 the typically expensive rates paid when a business or individual does not have a contracted deal in place. \"I think the unit rate she was quoting was 60p [pence] a unit for gas, which is just ridiculous. I'd imagine a year ago, we'd have been looking at 5 or 6p. It's just absolute madness,\" Speed said. \"We've got no idea what's going to be presented to us, because we've got no idea what's going to happen. The price is just going ballistic. No-one's going to buy it.\" The cost of gas for both businesses and consumers is only expected to increase through the colder winter months. Speed noted that local cafes cooking on gas will likely struggle, as they have no choice but to continue using it, unless they can replace gas appliances with electric ones. 'Scream very loudly at somebody' Rail strikes have already brought the country to a halt on multiple days throughout the summer and look set to continue, while postal workers, telecoms engineers and dock workers have all voted to strike as inflation erodes real wages. Conservative leadership favorite Liz Truss was earlier this month forced into a dramatic U-turn on a plan to cut public sector pay outside London, which would have axed wages for teachers, nurses, police and the armed forces alike. Local authorities recently offered state school support staff a flat pay rise of \u00a31,925 per year, meaning a 10.5% increase for the lowest-paid staff and just over 4% for the highest earners, after pressure from three of the country's largest unions. One woman in her early fifties \u2013 a member of support staff at a state school in Lincolnshire who asked not to be named due to the sensitive situation and concerns on public reprisals \u2013 told CNBC that years of real-terms pay cuts had left many low-paid public sector workers struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe British government in 2010, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, announced a two-year pay freeze for public sector workers, followed by a 1% average cap on public sector pay awards which was lifted in 2017, with average pay rises increasing to roughly 2% by 2020.

And that\u2019s because much else that underpins economic activity is expected to remain in rude health.\n\nOne of the pillars holding up growth is the property market. House price increases may have slowed in many areas, but they remain positive and continue to drive up values in coastal hotspots and desirable towns and suburbs to record highs.\n\nRents in the residential sector are also growing after a brief dip during the pandemic. Across the country, letting agents are so busy that their soaring commissions threaten to match the growth in mega-bonuses paid to investment bankers and private equity executives.\n\nIn July, while much of the nation was fretting about utility bills, rents in the capital rose 23% year on year\n\nDespite talk of levelling up, London\u2019s rental market has seen monthly rates soar by double digits to cement the capital as the go-to destination for young professionals. In July, while much of the nation was fretting about utility bills crippling their personal finances, rents in the capital rose 23% year on year, according to estate agency Foxtons, which says the number of renters competing for every property increased 27% over the same period.\n\nThe national average rise in rents demanded by landlords was 11.8%, says online agency Rightmove, pushing \u201casking rents\u201d outside London to another new record, of \u00a31,126 a month. In London, that monthly figure rose to \u00a32,257, with annual growth in asking prices now exceeding 15% across the capital, the highest ever annual rate of any region, by Rightmove\u2019s calculation.\n\nRenters regularly say there are 10 or 15 people turning up to view a property, such is the competition to secure a home in London. Much the same is said in other parts of the country, where rents may not be so high, but competition is equally fierce.\n\nOne reason for the sustained rise in rents can be found in figures showing a 40% fall in the number of flats and houses available to rent in the capital. The same fall can be seen in other regions and to an even greater extent in the number of property purchases since a high point last year. House purchases have halved since spring 2021, when Rishi Sunak ended a temporary cut in stamp duty.\n\nProperty owners are in a position to play a sophisticated game to maximise the value of their assets: making them available for rent or purchase when the price is right, and withdrawing them when it falls below their expectations.\n\nThere was a time when property was considered an illiquid market, based on assets that were difficult to buy and sell \u2013 and that is still true when compared with stocks and shares. However, the level of sophistication in the private sector \u2013 and the dominance of private developers now that public and social housing is fixed, adding little extra to the housing stock each year \u2013 means prices can be kept high indefinitely. Only a rise in unemployment can spoil private owners\u2019 plan of maintaining price growth and limiting the potential for rental values to fall.\n\nSo far the jobs market has proved robust. And while a recession is likely to increase the number of people out of work, the current demand for homes both to purchase and to rent will need to tumble to affect prices. The Bank of England believes the rate of unemployment will edge up about two percentage points over the next 18 months, from its current 40-year low of 3.8%.\n\nOfficials at the central bank are among the more pessimistic forecasters, but even this higher level of joblessness, and their own interest rate increases, are unlikely to spook the market.\n\nWhen asked by Rightmove in June, more landlords (34%) said they were planning to expand their portfolios over the next 12 months than said they would reduce them (11%) and it revised its forecast for growth in asking rents from 5% to 8%.\n\nLike the energy market, the property market is now well and truly rigged in favour of the owners and against their customers. Average monthly rents are now 40% higher than they were 10 years ago. After 12 years of Tory rule, it is yet another economic statistic that brings shame on the government.\n\n", "summary": "One of the pillars holding up growth is the property market.\nRenters regularly say there are 10 or 15 people turning up to view a property, such is the competition to secure a home in London.\nThe same fall can be seen in other regions and to an even greater extent in the number of property purchases since a high point last year.\nOnly a rise in unemployment can spoil private owners\u2019 plan of maintaining price growth and limiting the potential for rental values to fall.\nLike the energy market, the property market is now well and truly rigged in favour of the owners and against their customers."},

At last year\u2019s meeting, Powell dismissed rising prices as a \u201ctransitory\u201d phase triggered by supply chain problems related to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBut as prices have risen at rates unseen since the 1980s the Fed has moved to hike interest rates aggressively and is all but guaranteed to do so again when its committee meets again in September.\n\nAt each of its last two meetings the Fed has increased its benchmark federal funds rate by 0.75 percentage points, to a range between 2.25% and 2.5%, the most rapid rate of increase since the early 1990s.\n\nThere are signs that the rate of price rises is slowing in the US. Gas prices have fallen markedly and on Friday the commerce department announced that the central bank\u2019s preferred measure of inflation \u2013 \u200b\u200bthe Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index \u2013 slowed in July to an annual rate of 6.3%, down from 6.8% in June. But the rate of inflation remains far above the Fed\u2019s target rate of 2%.\n\nPowell made clear that the recent good news was unlikely to sway the Fed from its course. \u201cWhile the lower inflation readings for July are welcome, a single month\u2019s improvement falls far short of what the committee will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down,\u201d he said.\n\nCentral bankers across the world are struggling with similar issues. In the UK economists have predicted inflation will hit 18% in 2023 and millions of households face an 80% energy bill rise from 1 October. China could miss its annual growth target for the first time since 2015 as factory activity falls and the property market faces a crisis.\n\nBy comparison, parts of the US economy remain strong, notably consumer spending and the jobs market, where unemployment is at a 50-year low. But Powell emphasized that tackling inflation was now the Fed\u2019s top priority.\n\n\u201cOur responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional,\u201d said Powell. \u201cIt is true that high inflation is a global phenomenon, and that many economies around the world face inflation as high or higher than seen here in the United States,\u201d but said that did not diminish the Fed\u2019s \u201cresponsibility to carry out our assigned task of achieving price stability\u201d.", "summary": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost just over 1,000 points, 3%, the S&P fell 3.3% and the Nasdaq dropped almost 4%.\nSpeaking at the Kansas City Fed\u2019s annual meeting of the world\u2019s central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Powell said the Fed\u2019s \u201coverarching focus right now is to bring inflation back down\u201d.\nPowell said the Fed would continue to use its tools \u201cforcefully\u201d until prices were under control.\nBut a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOur responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional,\u201d said Powell."},

Here's how", "author": ["Greg Iacurci"], "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/25/how-president-biden-linked-a-15-minimum-wage-to-student-loan-reform.html", "content": "Fast-food workers and supporters fight to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. James Leynse | Corbis Historical | Getty Images\n\nThe Biden administration seems to have pegged a student loan policy announced Wednesday to its broader push for a national $15-an-hour minimum wage. The White House detailed a long-awaited plan to forgive up to $20,000 in federal student debt for borrowers, and extended a payment pause through the end of 2022. But tucked into the broader package of policy measures were tweaks to \"income-driven repayment plans.\" These plans help make monthly payments more affordable for low-income borrowers. The administration linked one of those tweaks \u2014 specifically, one relative to a definition of \"non-discretionary\" income \u2014 to a $15 minimum wage.\n\nHow student debt ties to a $15 minimum wage\n\n\"Non-discretionary\" income is basically the income a household funnels into essentials like rent, mortgage payments and food. For borrowers in income-driven plans, the government protects their non-discretionary income by exempting it from repayment. The amount is based on household annual income relative to the federal poverty line.\n\nUnder current rules, a borrower with income of less than 150% of the federal poverty level qualifies for a $0 monthly loan payment. In 2022, that equates to roughly $20,385 before tax for a single individual \u2014 about $9.80 an hour for a full-time worker. President Biden proposed raising that threshold to 225% of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $30,577.50 of annual income, or $14.70 an hour. The policy guarantees that \"no borrower earning under 225% of the federal poverty level \u2014 about the annual equivalent of a $15 minimum wage for a single borrower \u2014 will have to make a monthly payment,\" according to the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nThe policy \u2014 which applies to undergraduate student loans \u2014 means more borrowers in income-driven plans would qualify for a $0 monthly payment or owe a smaller monthly bill, according to student loan experts. \"These changes make things more affordable for borrowers and allow borrowers to avoid default,\" according to Whitney Barkley-Denney, senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending.\n\nOther changes to income-driven repayment plans\n\nThe administration also simultaneously announced other reforms to income-driven plans. None of the measures are final yet. The Education Department is proposing regulations \"in the coming days,\" the agency said Wednesday. The public will have a 30-day window in which it can comment on the proposal, and then the Department would then use those comments to craft a final rule, which could differ from the proposal. In addition to the higher \"non-discretionary\" income threshold, monthly payments for borrowers would be capped at 5% of income; that'd be half the current 10% cap.\n\nIt's another way of continuing to push the idea that $15 should be the minimum wage. Abigail Seldin CEO of the Seldin/Haring-Smith Foundation\n\nBarkley-Denney offered an example of how this would work for a one-person household: Let's say a borrower has an income of $60,000 in 2022. As noted above, the first $30,577.50 would be considered \"non-discretionary\" and therefore protected from repayment. The remaining $29,422.50 would be \"discretionary\" and used to calculate the borrower's monthly payment. The new rules would cap those payments at 5% of discretionary income \u2014 roughly $123 a month versus $245 a month under the current 10% maximum.", "summary": "James Leynse | Corbis Historical | Getty ImagesThe Biden administration seems to have pegged a student loan policy announced Wednesday to its broader push for a national $15-an-hour minimum wage.\nThe administration linked one of those tweaks \u2014 specifically, one relative to a definition of \"non-discretionary\" income \u2014 to a $15 minimum wage.\nHow student debt ties to a $15 minimum wage\"Non-discretionary\" income is basically the income a household funnels into essentials like rent, mortgage payments and food.\nOther changes to income-driven repayment plansThe administration also simultaneously announced other reforms to income-driven plans.\nThe remaining $29,422.50 would be \"discretionary\" and used to calculate the borrower's monthly payment."},

Eccles Federal Reserve Building, photographed on Wednesday, July 27, 2022 in Washington, DC. Kent Nishimura | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Reserve's path to bringing down runaway inflation while keeping the economy from slipping into a major downturn is still open but is getting narrower, according to Goldman Sachs. As the central bank looks to keep raising interest rates, the economy is teeming with mixed signals: rapidly rising payroll figures against sharply declining housing numbers, falling gasoline prices vs. surging shelter and food costs, and low consumer sentiment against steady spending numbers. Amid it all, the Fed is trying to strike a balance between slowing things down, but not by too much. On that score, Goldman economists think there have been clear wins, some losses and a landscape ahead that poses substantial challenges. \"Our broad conclusion is that there is a feasible but difficult path to a soft landing, though several factors beyond the Fed's control can ease or complicate that path and raise or lower the odds of success,\" Goldman economist David Mericle said in a client note Sunday.\n\nSlow growth, high inflation\n\nOne of the biggest inflation drivers has been outsized growth that has created imbalances between supply and demand. The Fed is using interest rate increases to try to damp down demand so supply can catch up, and supply chain pressures, as measured by a New York Fed index, are at their lowest since January 2021. So on that score, Mericle said the Fed's efforts have \"gone well.\" He said the rate increases \u2014 totaling 2.25 percentage points since March \u2014 have \"achieved a much-need deceleration\" regarding growth and specifically demand. In fact, Goldman expects GDP to grow at just a 1% pace over the next four quarters, and that's coming off consecutive declines of 1.6% and 0.9%. Though most economists expect that the National Bureau of Economic Research will not declare the U.S. in recession for the first half of the year, the slow-growth path makes the Fed's balancing act more difficult. On a similar count, Mericle said the Fed's moves have helped narrow the supply-demand gap in the labor market, where there are still nearly two job openings for every available worker. That effort \"has a long way to go,\" he wrote. However, the biggest problem remains stubbornly high inflation. The consumer price index was flat in July but still rose 8.5% from a year ago. Wages are surging at a strong clip, with average hourly earnings up 5.2% from a year ago. Consequently, the Fed's efforts to halt a spiral in which higher prices feed higher wages and perpetuate inflation have \"shown little convincing progress so far,\" Mericle said. \"The bad news is that high inflation is broad-based, measures of the underlying trend are elevated, and business inflation expectations and pricing intentions remain high,\" he added.\n\nDoubts about the Fed's policy path\n\nFighting inflation might require higher rate hikes than the market currently anticipates. Goldman's projection is that the Fed raises benchmark rates by another percentage point before the end of the year, but Mericle acknowledged that there is \"upside risk\" due to \"the recent easing in financial conditions, the robust pace of hiring, and signs of stickiness in wage growth and inflation.\" Indeed, former New York Fed President William Dudley said Monday he thinks the market is underestimating the future path of rate hikes and, consequently, the risks of a hard landing or recession.\n\n\"The market is misunderstanding what the Fed is up to,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in a live interview. \"I think the Fed is going to be higher for longer than what market participants understand at this point.\" In Dudley's view, the Fed will keep hiking until it is sure inflation is heading back to the central bank's 2% target. Even by the most generous inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price index that the Fed follows, inflation is still running at 4.8%. \"The labor market is much tighter than the Fed wants. The wage inflation rate is too high, not consistent with 2% inflation,\" he added. Dudley expects the rates to keep going up until the employment dynamic has shifted enough to get the unemployment rate \"well above 4%,\" compared to its current level of 3.5%.", "summary": "Slow growth, high inflationOne of the biggest inflation drivers has been outsized growth that has created imbalances between supply and demand.\nHowever, the biggest problem remains stubbornly high inflation.\n\"The bad news is that high inflation is broad-based, measures of the underlying trend are elevated, and business inflation expectations and pricing intentions remain high,\" he added.\nEven by the most generous inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price index that the Fed follows, inflation is still running at 4.8%.\nThe wage inflation rate is too high, not consistent with 2% inflation,\" he added."},

That is the brutal reality facing the UK as gas and electricity bills rocket this winter.\n\nFor months it has been clear the energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, would raise its price cap from just under \u00a32,000 a year to about the \u00a33,500 mark and it has duly announced an 80% increase.\n\nUltimately, rocketing prices will have some beneficial effects. Renewable sources of energy will become relatively cheaper and their use will increase. With Whitehall \u201cwar-gaming\u201d a scenario in which there are energy shortages in the months ahead, a higher priority will be given to energy self-sufficiency.\n\nBusinesses found ingenious ways of coping with lockdown and some are being equally creative when it comes to cutting energy usage. The crisis may lead to a long overdue stepping up of investment in home insulation.\n\nBut none of that will really have much impact this winter, which looks likely to be as tough as anything that was seen during the pandemic \u2013 and potentially much tougher.\n\nConsumer and business confidence has weakened in anticipation of the higher bills to come but the economy has been marking time. Activity remained pretty much unchanged in the second quarter of 2022, retail sales were up in July and unemployment is close to its lowest levels in half a century.\n\nHowever, that is all about to change \u2013 unless the government comes up with something big in terms of a support package covering consumers and business. Current support packages anticipated a price cap in October of \u00a32,800, not the \u00a33,549 that Ofgem announced on Friday morning. The idea that prices could carry on rising and stay high for at least the next year was simply not factored into any official economic forecasts.\n\nSoaring energy bills affect the economy in three key ways. First, they push up the cost of living, with the new price figure adding about four percentage points to the annual inflation rate. The Bank of England has already factored the October increase into its forecast for inflation to reach 13.3%.\n\nYet with the still rising global cost of gas now putting the price cap on course to breach the \u00a35,000 a year threshold in January, the increase in price pressures could turn out to be much more significant. Earlier this week the US investment bank Citi predicted inflation would peak at more than 18% next year.\n\nThreadneedle Street has raised interest rates at the last six meetings of its monetary policy committee, and further increases are likely over the coming months.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wage rates have been picking up over the past year as workers have sought to maintain their living standards \u2013 but not nearly as fast as prices have been rising. That gap is growing, and with consumers forced to spend more on energy they have less to spend on other things.\n\nThird, businesses are going to be hurt by increased costs and a reduction in consumer spending.

Andrew Kelly | Reuters\n\nIf inflation has been the biggest threat to U.S. economic growth, then July's data should provide signs that there's at least some relief in the pipeline. Prices were flat for the month as gauged by the items that the Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks for its consumer price index. That marked the first time the aggregate measure hadn't posted a month-over-month increase since May 2020, when the widely followed index showed a modest decline. Just a month ago, CPI posted its fastest 12-month gain since November 1982, following a trend that helped send economic growth into contraction for the first half of the year, stirring up talk of a recession. But with at least the short-term trend indicating the rate of price increases is abating, economic optimism is perking up.\n\nNo recession, for now\n\n\"The whole recession narrative really needs to be put on a shelf for now,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies. \"I think it's going to be shifting to a stronger-for-longer narrative, which is really supported by a reversal in inflation.\" Markowska, whose forecasts this year have been accurate, sees solid growth in the near term, including a 3% growth rate in the third quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow gauge, which tracks economic data in real time, pointed to a 2.5% growth rate in a Wednesday update, up 1.1 percentage points from its last one on Aug. 4. However, Markowska also expects pressures to intensify in 2023, with a recession likely in the back part of the year. Indeed, there was a little bit for both arguments in the CPI report. Most of the tempering in inflation came because of a fall in energy prices. Gasoline slid 7.7%, the biggest monthly decline since April 2020. Fuel oil tumbled 11% as energy-related commodity prices were off 7.6%.\n\nTransportation services cost increases also came off the boil, with airline fares tumbling 7.8% to reverse a trend that has seen tickets surge 27.7% over the past year. But there were few other signs of inflation declines in the report, with food costs particularly high. The food index, in fact, rose 1.1% on the month, and its 10.9% pace over the past 12 months is the highest since May 1979. That's causing worries at places such as City Harvest, which helps feed needy New Yorkers who have been hit especially hard by price surge that began last year. \"We're seeing many more children come into food pantries,\" said Jilly Stephens, the organization's CEO. \"Food insecurity had been intractable even before the pandemic hit. Now we're seeing even more people turn to food pantries because of the rising prices.\" Stephens said the number of children seeking food assistance about doubled a year after the Covid pandemic hit, and the organization is struggling to keep up. \"We're always optimistic, because we are supported by incredibly generous New Yorkers,\" she said.\n\nPeople keep spending\n\nDespite the surging prices, consumers have been resilient, continuing to spend even with inflation-adjusted wages contracting 3% over the past year. Jonathan Silver, CEO of Affinity Solutions, which tracks consumer behavior through credit and debit card transactions, said spending is at a healthy pace, rising about 10.5% over the past year, though inflation is influencing behavior. \"When you start to look at specific categories, there's been a lot of shifting in spending, and as a result, some categories are being impacted more than others by inflation,\" he said. \"People are delaying their spending on discretionary items.\" For instance, he said department store spending has fallen 2.4% over the past year, while discount store spending has risen 17%. Amusement park spending is down 18%, but movie theaters are up 92%. Some of those numbers are influenced by rising prices, but they generally reflect the level of transactions as well. As inflation eases, Silver expects discretionary spending to increase. \"We believe there will be a spike later in the year that will create an upward slope to the spending in key categories where the consumer has been delaying and deferring spending,\" he said. \"Consumers may get a holiday present of some relief on food prices.\"", "summary": "A shopping cart is seen in a supermarket as inflation affected consumer prices in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., June 10, 2022.\nAndrew Kelly | ReutersIf inflation has been the biggest threat to U.S. economic growth, then July's data should provide signs that there's at least some relief in the pipeline.\n\"I think it's going to be shifting to a stronger-for-longer narrative, which is really supported by a reversal in inflation.\"\nHowever, Markowska also expects pressures to intensify in 2023, with a recession likely in the back part of the year.\n\"Consumers may get a holiday present of some relief on food prices.\""},

The White House said it would cancel $10,000 in federal student debt for most borrowers and up to $20,000 for recipients of Pell Grants, which are available to undergraduates based on financial need. The plan may eliminate balances for at least 9 million borrowers, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.\n\nBiden 'should have, and could have, done much more'\n\nAstra Taylor, co-founder of the Debt Collective, a union for debtors, called Wednesday's announcement \"bittersweet.\" \"On the one hand, this is a landmark victory for our movement,\" she said in a statement. \"Yet, President Biden should have, and could have, done much more than cancel $10,000 or [$]20,000 \u2014 and he could have made the relief automatic, instead of imposing unnecessary hurdles.\"\n\nNearly 8 million borrowers may be eligible for automatic relief; however, some borrowers may need to apply if the U.S. Department of Education doesn't have relevant income data, according to the federal student aid website. That application isn't yet available. \"We intend to keep fighting until all student debt is canceled and college is free,\" Taylor said. \"If President Biden can cancel this much debt he can cancel it all.\" Biden paired the debt cancellation and payment pause with a measure to cap undergraduate loan repayments at 5% of monthly income.\n\nWarren, Schumer pledge to 'pursue every available path'\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., hailed the policy announcement Wednesday as \"the single most effective action that the President can take on his own to help working families and the economy.\" The duo had been pushing the White House to cancel up to $50,000 in federal student debt \u2014 and they alluded to an ongoing fight for more relief.\n\n\"Make no mistake, the work \u2014 our work \u2014 will continue as we pursue every available path to address the student debt crisis, help close the racial wealth gap for borrowers, and keep our economy growing,\" Schumer and Warren said.\n\nCanceling $10,000 'hardly achieves anything'\n\nDerrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP, lamented that Biden didn't cancel $50,000 of loans or more per borrower. He called student debt forgiveness a \"racial and economic justice issue\" that could help close the racial wealth gap, which often pushes Black students to borrow more than other students.\n\n\"Canceling just $10,000 of debt is like pouring a bucket of ice water on a forest fire,\" Johnson wrote in an op-ed. \"It hardly achieves anything \u2014 only making a mere dent in the problem.\" Data suggests that doubling the maximum forgiveness amount \u2014 to $20,000 \u2014 for Pell Grant recipients will most benefit Black student borrowers.

However, the leader of Burnley council, Afrasiab Anwar, says there is only so much goodwill they can rely on as more people struggle to get by and local services are stretched. In 2020, the council set up a charity in partnership with other local organisations to support the community during the pandemic.

The price index for agricultural inputs leapt by 33.1% in the year to June, government data shows, led by fertilisers and soil improvers which more than doubled (+128%), energy and lubricants (+66%) and animal food (up around 33%). This forced farmers to lift their own prices by around 25% year-on-year, with the output value of oats soaring by 88%, wheat up 54%, rapeseed up 66% and milk by 41% in the year to June. UK agricultural input and output costs Photograph: UK government This is even before the closure of ammonia production by CF Fertilisers raises fresh worries about rising costs, and even potential livestock culls. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains: Farmers may once again face the difficult decision of having to cull animals if a backlog builds up for abattoirs and if a solution to the looming CO2 shortage isn\u2019t found quickly. Farms have been trying to absorb the eye-watering rise in costs, by finding new ways of working. Although input costs rose by 33.1% the value of agricultural output rose by 24.9% in the year to June. This still represents a horrible rise in prices which has been feeding through to our grocery bills. The value of some agricultural products have soared much higher than the headline rate such as oats, up 88%, oilseed rape up 66% and milk up 41% in the year to June, and only forage plants saw a reduction in output value. Although the rise in farmers input costs have been slowing down a little, they are still on an upwards trajectory and this latest fertiliser production crisis will add fresh impetus to the storm they are facing.\n\nUpdated at 13.36 BST\n\n3d ago 12.55 A shortages of carbon dioxide could leave farmers unable to send animals for processing for food, creating a \u2018serious animal welfare risk\u2019, Farmers Guardian reports. Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association, explained: We knew back in June that the closure of CF Industries\u2019 Cheshire plant would leave UK CO2 supplies vulnerable to anything going wrong with their remaining Billingham plant and that we would be heavily reliant on overseas suppliers to make up the shortfall. Since then, ammonia producers in Italy and Germany have cut production which sent European food and drink companies scrambling to secure tightening supplies of the gas at the end of July. Whilst we are in a much better position now than we were a year ago, if CF Industries follows through on its threat to close Billingham the British meat industry will have serious concerns.

Wheat, soybean, sugar, and corn futures have fallen from their March highs back to prices seen at the start of 2022. Olga Maltseva | Afp | Getty Images\n\nFood prices dropped significantly in July from the previous month, particularly the costs of wheat and vegetable oil, according to the latest figures from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. But the FAO said that while the drop in food prices \"from very high levels\" is \"welcome,\" there are doubts over whether the good news will last. \"Many uncertainties remain, including high fertilizer prices that can impact future production prospects and farmers' livelihoods, a bleak global economic outlook, and currency movements, all of which pose serious strains for global food security,\" FAO chief economist Maximo Torero said in a press release. The FAO food price index, which tracks the monthly change in the global prices of a basket of food commodities, fell 8.6% in July from the month before. In June, the index fell just 2.3% month on month. However, the index in July was still 13.1% higher than July 2021.\n\nPrices in the short term may fall further, if futures are anything to go by. Wheat, soybean, sugar, and corn futures have fallen from their March highs back to prices seen at the start of 2022. For example, the wheat contracts closed at $775.75 per bushel on Friday, down from a 12-year high of $1,294 in March, and around the $758 price set in January.\n\nWhy prices fell\n\nAnalysts cited a mix of both demand and supply reasons for the slide in food prices: Ukraine and Russia's closely watched agreement to resume exports of grain through the Black Sea after months of blockade; better-than-expected crop harvests; a global economic slowdown; and the strong U.S. dollar. Rob Vos, the director of markets, trade and institutions at the International Food Policy Research Institute, pointed to the news that the United States and Australia are set to deliver bumper wheat harvests this year, which will improve supply since shipment from Ukraine and Russia have been curtailed. The higher U.S. dollar also lowers the price of staples, since commodities are priced in U.S. dollars, Vos said. Traders tend to ask for lower nominal dollar prices of commodities when the greenback is expensive.\n\nThe widely heralded U.N.-backed deal between Ukraine and Russia also helped to cool the market. Ukraine was the world's sixth-biggest wheat exporter in 2021, accounting for 10% of global wheat market share, according to the United Nations. The first shipment of Ukrainian grain \u2014 26,000 tons of maize \u2014 since the invasion left the country's southwestern port of Odesa last Monday.\n\nSkepticism over Ukraine-Russia deal\n\nGlobal skepticism over whether Russia will keep its end of the bargain hangs in the air. Russia fired a missile onto Odesa just hours after the U.N.-brokered deal in late-July. And freight and insurance companies may still think it's too risky to ship grain out of a war zone, Vos said, adding that food prices remain volatile and any new shock can cause more price surges. \"To make a difference it will not be enough to get a few shipments out, but at least 30 or 40 per month to get the existing grains stored in Ukraine out, as well as the produce of the upcoming harvest,\" said Vos. \"To help stabilize markets, the deal will need to hold in full also during the second half of the year since that is the period where Ukraine does most of its exports.\"\n\nEven with the existing agreement, arable Ukrainian land may continue to be destroyed \"for as long as the war continues,\" which will result in even less crop yield next year, Carlos Mera, the head of agri commodities market research at Rabobank, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Europe\" last week. \"Once this [grain] corridor is over, we might see even more price increases going forward,\" Mera said. Consumers could also see further price increases as there is normally a lag of three to nine months before a movement in commodity prices is reflected on supermarket shelves. Then there is the pressure of exporting enough grain as quickly as possible from a war zone. \"It's time that we're working again. I don't see us exporting two [to] five million tons per month out of these Black Sea ports,\" John Rich, the executive chairman of Ukrainian poultry giant Myronivsky Hliboproduct (MHP), told CNBC's \"Capital Connection\" on Monday. \"Hungry people, at the end of the day, get hungry very quickly after a week.\" In a note published earlier this month, credit rating agency Fitch Ratings' analysts wrote that a possible increase in fertilizer prices, which fell recently \u2014 but which are still double that of 2020 \u2014 could cause grain prices to jump again. Russia's restriction of gas supply has led European natural gas prices to spike. Natural gas is a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers. La Nina weather patterns could disrupt grain harvests later this year as well, they added.\n\nAnd the fall in food prices is not all good news. Part of the reason why staples have become cheaper is that traders and investors are pricing in recessionary fears, the analysts said. The global manufacturing purchasing managers' index has been in decline, while the U.S. Federal Reserve seems bent on raising interest rates to curb inflation even if it triggers a recession, the Fitch team wrote.\n\nFood staples", "summary": "But the FAO said that while the drop in food prices \"from very high levels\" is \"welcome,\" there are doubts over whether the good news will last.\nThe FAO food price index, which tracks the monthly change in the global prices of a basket of food commodities, fell 8.6% in July from the month before.\nIn June, the index fell just 2.3% month on month.\nUkraine was the world's sixth-biggest wheat exporter in 2021, accounting for 10% of global wheat market share, according to the United Nations.\nAnd the fall in food prices is not all good news."},

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nThe consumer outlook for inflation decreased significantly in July amid a sharp drop in gas prices and a growing belief that the rapid surges in food and housing also would ebb in the future. The New York Federal Reserve's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations showed that respondents expect inflation to run at a 6.2% pace over the next year and a 3.2% rate for the next three years. While those numbers are still very high by historical standards, they mark a big drop-off from the respective 6.8% and 3.6% results from the June survey. Through June, food prices rose 10.4% over the past year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They are still expected to climb 6.7% over the next 12 months, but that's a decline from the June survey of 2.5 percentage points, the biggest fall in a data series going back to June 2013.\n\nLikewise, respondents see gas prices, which rose 60% over the past year, increasing at just a 1.5% pace over the next year, a slide of 4.2 percentage points from June, the second-biggest monthly decline in the survey's history. The price of regular gas has come down about 67 cents a gallon over the past month though it remains 87 cents higher than a year ago, according to AAA. Commodity prices overall have been falling significantly as well. Finally, home prices are expected to rise 3.5% from June's 4.4%, the lowest projected gain since November 2020. Five-year inflation expectations also slipped, dropping 0.5 percentage point to 2.3%.\n\nThe results come as the Fed has been raising interest rates aggressively to bring down inflation running at its highest level in more than 40 years. The central bank in 2022 has hiked benchmark rates four times for a total of 2.25 percentage points, and market pricing indicates a third consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase in September, according to CME Group data. However, the New York Fed results from July might give policymakers reason to pull back if not in September then later in the year if the inflation data cooperates. The Fed targets inflation at 2% over the long run, so the projected levels in the survey remain well above the central bank's comfort level. Over the weekend, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said she doesn't expect inflation to come down anytime soon and sees a need to keep pushing rates higher. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly echoed those sentiments, saying the increases are \"far from done.\" Those comments came after the BLS on Friday reported much higher numbers for payroll growth \u2014 528,000 \u2014 and wages, with average hourly earnings jumping 5.2%.", "summary": "The results come as the Fed has been raising interest rates aggressively to bring down inflation running at its highest level in more than 40 years.\nHowever, the New York Fed results from July might give policymakers reason to pull back if not in September then later in the year if the inflation data cooperates.\nThe Fed targets inflation at 2% over the long run, so the projected levels in the survey remain well above the central bank's comfort level.\nOver the weekend, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said she doesn't expect inflation to come down anytime soon and sees a need to keep pushing rates higher.\nSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly echoed those sentiments, saying the increases are \"far from done.\""},

The country is not expected to reach its economic growth target of 5.5% this year.\n\nHuawei, routinely listed as China\u2019s largest firm, is working to manage big falls in revenue and profit. Revenue declined 14% in the first three months of 2022 and its net profit margin narrowed to 4.3%, from 11.1% a year earlier, in the three months through March.\n\nIt has been a flashpoint of US-China tensions, with Washington and other western counterparts restricting Huawei from their markets over national security concerns. The company has also been barred from buying some foreign technology.\n\n\u201cIn the past, we embraced the ideal of globalisation and aspired to serve all mankind, so what is our ideal now?\u201d wrote Ren.\n\n\u201cSurvive and earn a little money where we can. From this point of view, we need to adjust the market structure and study what can be done and what should be abandoned.\u201d\n\nRen\u2019s memo went viral on Chinese social media, shared and discussed by more than 100 million users, with some expressing fear of what it meant for regular people and small businesses if a company the size of Huawei was sending such warnings.\n\n\u201cThe last person who said such things was Vanke\u2019s Wang Shi and then real estate was in danger,\u201d said one commenter, referring to the chief executive of a state-run property development company.\n\nSeveral blamed the US, with one commenter saying Huawei\u2019s expansion \u201ccame to an abrupt end under the frenzied suppression of the United States\u201d.\n\nLinghao Bao, an analyst at Trivium China, said the global economy was in bad shape and it was not unusual to be cutting costs in a recession. \u201cThe reason why Ren Zhengfei\u2019s words stood out is the way he said it. He sounded like he was in panic mode,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, it\u2019s a politically sensitive time right now. We\u2019re just a couple of months away from the 20th party congress. As you know, economic performance is tied up with the party\u2019s legitimacy.\u201d\n\nProfessor Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute, said Ren enjoyed a status that might allow him to speak more freely than others, and should be taken seriously.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The questions are whether Xi will have the pragmatism and vision of Ren to come up with something that may be as effective as what Ren is putting forth for Huawei.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s government this week announced a further $146bn (\u00a3123bn) in stimulus funding and 19 new measures to address the economic damage wrought by the pandemic and the country\u2019s hardline responses, as well as a crisis in the property development industry.\n\nExtensive and unpredictable lockdowns have disrupted factory production, supply chains and general economic activity, particularly among small businesses. The private sector provides a third of all jobs in China and creates 90% of new urban jobs, according to state media.\n\nYouth unemployment reached an all-time high of 19.9% in July and the general urban jobless rate remained at a relatively high rate of 5.4%. Unemployment insurance payouts also hit a record high in June.\n\n\u201cAmid sporadic Covid-19 outbreaks in some regions since the beginning of this year, job demand in the market has reduced and some recruitment campaigns have been cancelled or delayed,\u201d Zhang Ying, the director of employment promotion at the ministry of human resources and social security, said at a news conference on Thursday.\n\n\u201cSome young job hunters have encountered new difficulties.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Xiaoqian Zhu and agencies", "summary": "The founder of Huawei has delivered a stark warning for the tech company\u2019s future, sparking alarm with the frankness of his assessment and what it signals for smaller businesses amid China\u2019s economic troubles and a global downturn.\nThe country is not expected to reach its economic growth target of 5.5% this year.\nHuawei, routinely listed as China\u2019s largest firm, is working to manage big falls in revenue and profit.\nIt has been a flashpoint of US-China tensions, with Washington and other western counterparts restricting Huawei from their markets over national security concerns.\nThe private sector provides a third of all jobs in China and creates 90% of new urban jobs, according to state media."},

A big one. More than 45 million Americans \u2013 more than the population of California \u2013 now owe a collective $1.7tn in student debt.\n\nThe vast majority of the money is owed to the federal government, which has been backing or directly offering student loans for higher education since 1958. While student loans are not new in the United States, the amount of student debt has more than tripled over the last 16 years.\n\nFor the first time in history, the federal government will cancel a large swath of student debt to address the crisis. On Wednesday, Joe Biden announced borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year will see $10,000 shaved off their debt. Most borrowers will qualify for some cancellation. For at least 15 million, that means complete erasure of their debt.\n\nStudent debt will remain a hot political issue. Understanding the impact of such a dramatic policy requires unpacking the student debt crisis, beginning with its origins.\n\nHow the student debt crisis started\n\nIn 1957 the Soviet Union successfully launching the first earth-orbiting satellite, Sputnik. With the cold war raging the federal government feared the US education system was failing to produce enough scientists and engineers to compete with the Soviets and, in 1958, started handing out student loans through the National Defense Education Act.\n\nNearly a decade later, the Higher Education Act of 1965 allowed more people to take out loans as the federal government promised to pay back banks for any loans that were not repaid.\n\n\u201cIt all started from this choice, which I think was a terrible choice, to decide that as a policy matter we should support higher education \u2026 by giving [students] an opportunity to get a loan,\u201d said Dali\u00e9 Jimenez, professor of law and director of the Student Loan Law Initiative at the University of California at Irvine. \u201cIt was just a terrible mistake.\u201d\n\nStarting in 2010, the federal government started directly lending money to student borrowers. In the wake of the Great Recession, the amount of student debt began to increase rapidly. Colleges were seeing increased enrollment as people left the workforce to go back to school. States slashed their higher education budgets, leading to higher tuition. More students were turning to for-profit colleges, which tend to be more expensive than public colleges.\n\nOver the last few years, the amount of grant aid, which does not need to be paid back, has risen. Yet despite this appearance of more financial support for students to attend college, the cost of attendance has remained the same.\n\nThe cost of attending public college has actually increased at a higher rate than the cost to attend a private college. The net cost of attendance for four-year public colleges, which takes into account any grants students receive, went from $17,500 in 2006 to $20,210 in 2016, according to data from College Board.\n\n\u201cThat era 10 years ago was a really formative moment for producing a lot of debt that\u2019s still out there,\u201d said Kevin Miller, associate director for higher education at the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s Economic Policy Project. \u201cThe cost of college attendance has gone up a lot while household incomes in the United States haven\u2019t \u2026 there\u2019s a real sense that if grant, state or institutional aid isn\u2019t filling the gap, that just leaves debt as the only option.\u201d\n\nWhat student debt looks like today\n\nFor the 2021-2022 school year, the average cost of tuition and fees for a four-year public college is $10,740. The cost is nearly quadrupled for private institutions, at an average of $38,070. Even with grant aid, the cost of attendance is an average of $19,230 for public institutions and $32,720 at private schools.\n\nEstimates put the average debt of those in the class of 2019 who took out student loans at $28,950. The number is close to the maximum $31,000 that students who are dependents of parents or guardians can borrow from the federal government to fund undergraduate education.\n\nContinuing racial wealth disparities are reflected in who has to take out loans to fund college. About half of Black college students take out student loans, compared with 40% of white students. Black Americans owe an average of $25,000 more in debt than their white counterparts and are more likely to be behind on their payments.\n\nDespite the amount of debt many students need to take on to attend college, nearly 20 million Americans still enroll in college every year. While earnings can depend on a person\u2019s industry, those with a bachelor\u2019s degrees earn 75% more in their lifetime than those with just a high school diploma.\n\n\u201cThe message is you have to get a college degree. It\u2019s not just a rhetorical message, it\u2019s an actual truth that if you don\u2019t have a college degree, particularly if you are Black or brown \u2026 you will not be able to get a job that is better than your parents\u2019,\u201d Jimenez said.\n\nThose with graduate and professional degrees earn even more, but the price for an advanced degree is even higher. A good chunk of student debt \u2013 about 40% \u2013 is held by those who took out loans to pay for graduate school.\n\nWhat the government has done to address student debt\n\nAfter over a year of deliberation, the White House announced on Wednesday the largest student debt cancellation in US history. Federal borrowers making under $125,000 will see $10,000 of their debt forgiven. The policy represents a fulfillment of a promise Biden made on the campaign trail to cancel $10,000 of student debt.\n\nUntil Wednesday, the most substantial policy addressing student debt was first implemented by the Trump administration, which paused student loan payments and interest accrual at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Both Trump and Biden extended the pause over the last two years, and it is now set to expire on 31 August.\n\nSince the beginning of this year, Biden has announced a slate of additional policies alongside the pause extension. Those who have defaulted or are delinquent on their federal student loans will be returned to good standing. Biden forgave $415m in student debt for borrowers who attended predatory for-profit schools.\n\nHis administration also announced changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which forgives the student loans of borrowers who are non-profit and government employees after 10 years of debt or after 120 payments are made. Over 113,000 borrowers with a cumulative $6.8bn in debt are now eligible for forgiveness. Over the years, the program has been under much criticism, as relief through the program was rare and borrowers were often deemed not qualified for logistical reasons.\n\nThe debate over debt forgiveness\n\nRepublicans have been using student debt as a talking point against Biden as the midterm elections approach.\n\nSenator Mitt Romney suggested that Democrats canceling student loans is a way of bribing voters. \u201cOther bribe suggestions: Forgive auto loans? Forgive credit card debt? Forgive mortgages?\u201d he wrote on Twitter. JD Vance (who went to Yale Law School) told the Washington Post that \u201cBiden essentially wants blue-collar workers like truck drivers \u2013 who didn\u2019t have the luxury of going to college to get drunk for four years \u2013 to bail out a bunch of upper-middle-class kids.\u201d\n\nThe reality is that the student loans of those in the highest income quartile \u2013 people making more than $97,000 \u2013 do make up a third of all outstanding student debt. But many low-income Americans also have student debt, though the amount of debt they have is smaller. Those making below $27,000 a year make up 17% of all borrowers, but their loans comprise 12% of all the outstanding debt.\n\nAn income threshold could be a way for the government to target forgiveness to those who need it most. But some have pointed out that an income ceiling does not take into consideration a person\u2019s wealth.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at a snapshot of what your income was this year or last year, that tells you very little,\u201d Jimenez said. \u201cIf your family has no wealth, you\u2019re very differently situated from someone who has family wealth or personal wealth from previous careers.\u201d\n\nThose who have been advocating for student debt cancellation say that $10,000 in forgiveness will not be enough to address the breadth of the crisis. Democratic lawmakers, including Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have called on Biden to cancel up to $50,000.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in a cutoff, especially for so many of the frontline workers who are drowning in debt and would likely be excluded from relief,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told the Washington Post. \u201cCanceling $50,000 in debt is where you really make a dent in inequality and the racial gap. $10,000 isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nEnding the student debt crisis for good\n\nEven though millions will now see debt cancellation, future college students will continue to take out loans \u2013 and at higher interest rates. Tackling the price tag of college will come with its own complications, but advocates say it will be necessary to ensure student debt does not get worse.\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s plan for free community college was killed along with the rest of the social and climate spending bill that was making its way through Congress, some efforts for better college funding are happening at the local level.\n\nIn March, the governor of New Mexico signed a bill that would use $75m in state funds to cover tuition and fees for undergraduate students at two- and four-year colleges. Drives for similar government support have been seen in Pennsylvania, California and Maine.\n\n\u201cThe cost of college is too high for a lot of students to manage without debt. Making it so that students can go without debt or take less debt in the first place is the thing that we really need to be focusing on,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWhat about the next generation or the one after that?\u201d", "summary": "More than 45 million Americans \u2013 more than the population of California \u2013 now owe a collective $1.7tn in student debt.\nWhile student loans are not new in the United States, the amount of student debt has more than tripled over the last 16 years.\nUnderstanding the impact of such a dramatic policy requires unpacking the student debt crisis, beginning with its origins.\nHow the student debt crisis startedIn 1957 the Soviet Union successfully launching the first earth-orbiting satellite, Sputnik.\nBut many low-income Americans also have student debt, though the amount of debt they have is smaller."},

Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. Inflation F.A.Q. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Inflation F.A.Q. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. Inflation F.A.Q. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Inflation F.A.Q. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks.

Olivier Douliery | AFP | Getty Images\n\nYou'd be hard-pressed now to find a recession in the rearview mirror. What's down the road, though, is another story. There is no historical precedent to indicate that an economy in recession can produce 528,000 jobs in a month, as the U.S. did during July. A 3.5% unemployment rate, tied for the lowest since 1969, is not consistent with contraction. But that doesn't mean there isn't a recession ahead, and, ironically enough, it is the labor market's phenomenal resiliency that could pose the broader economy's biggest long-run danger. The Federal Reserve is trying to ease pressures on a historically tight jobs situation and its rapid wage gains in an effort to control inflation running at its highest level in more than 40 years.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is this gives the Fed additional room to continue to tighten, even if it raises the probability of pushing the economy into recession,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \"It's not going to be an easy task to continue to tighten without negative repercussions for the consumer and the economy.\" Indeed, following the robust job numbers, which included a 5.2% 12-month gain for average hourly earnings, traders accelerated their bets on a more aggressive Fed. As of Friday afternoon, markets were assigning about a 69% chance of the central bank enacting its third straight 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike when it meets again in September, according to CME Group data. So while President Joe Biden celebrated the big jobs number on Friday, a much more unpleasant data point could be on the way next week. The consumer price index, the most widely followed inflation measure, comes out Wednesday, and it's expected to show continued upward pressure even with a sharp drop in gasoline prices in July. That will complicate the central bank's balancing act of using rate increases to temper inflation without tipping the economy into recession. As Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at asset management giant BlackRock, said, the challenge is \"how to execute a 'soft landing' when the economy is coming in hot, and is landing on a runway it has never used before.\" \"Today's print, coming in much stronger than anticipated, complicates the job of a Federal Reserve that seeks to engineer a more temperate employment environment, in keeping with its attempts to moderate current levels of inflation,\" Rieder said in a client note. \"The question though now is how much longer (and higher) will rates have to go before inflation can be brought under control?\"\n\nMore recession signs\n\nFinancial markets were betting against the Fed in other ways. The 2-year Treasury note yield exceeded that of the 10-year note by the highest margin in about 22 years Friday afternoon. That phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, has been a telltale recession sign particularly when it goes on for an extended period of time. In the present case, the inversion has been in place since early July. But that doesn't mean a recession is imminent, only that one is likely over the next year or two. While that means the central bank has some time on its side, it also could mean it won't have the luxury of slow hikes but rather will have to continue to move quickly \u2014 a situation that policymakers had hoped to avoid. \"This is certainly not my base case, but I think that we may start to hear some chatter of an inter-meeting hike, but only if the next batch of inflation reports is hot,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.", "summary": "There is no historical precedent to indicate that an economy in recession can produce 528,000 jobs in a month, as the U.S. did during July.\nBut that doesn't mean there isn't a recession ahead, and, ironically enough, it is the labor market's phenomenal resiliency that could pose the broader economy's biggest long-run danger.\n\"It's not going to be an easy task to continue to tighten without negative repercussions for the consumer and the economy.\"\nThat will complicate the central bank's balancing act of using rate increases to temper inflation without tipping the economy into recession.\nBut that doesn't mean a recession is imminent, only that one is likely over the next year or two."},

Clive Betts, the Labour MP who chairs the levelling up committee, says that when Greg Clark replaced Michael Gove as levelling up secretary in July, he asked Betts to tell him over the summer what the committee thought of the levelling up and regeneration bill. Not much seems to be the answer. Today Betts has released the letter he has sent to Clark on behalf of his committee giving an assessment of the bill and here is the key paragraph. It is the committee\u2019s view that the main tool to achieve levelling up will be through appropriate funding to those areas that need it most. This funding will help in making progress on the levelling up missions related to public transport and local connectivity; transforming digital connectivity; improving education outcomes; increasing the number of adults who complete high quality skills training; and increasing healthy life expectancy. None of the provisions in the bill will directly contribute to making progress towards achieving these missions \u2013 other than setting them. There is also no funding for levelling up associated with the bill. Like all select committees, this one has a narrow Conservative majority. And in a statement to journalists Betts said: In its current form, the bill does little to reassure that levelling up will prove to be more than just a slogan and that we will have meaningful change in local communities across the country. In key areas, it is unclear how the government intends to drive change and they are yet to commit to the spending that is necessary to level up the country. Our inquiry has focused on the planning provisions in the bill, which can be described as loosely-connected proposals to tinker with the current system, hopefully achieving some improvement.

In a joint letter to the Cabinet Office, Mike Clancy, the Prospect general secretary, and Dave Penman, the FDA general secretary, said: In the context of high and rising inflation, the 2-3% range set in the guidance is clearly not fit for purpose. The latest predictions suggest inflation could reach 18%, far beyond what was envisaged when the guidance was set for this year. In that context it is clear that cost of living pressures cannot in any way be meaningfully addressed for our members within an envelope of 2-3%. A refusal to recognise this across all grades in the service is both unacceptable and damaging. Clancy and Penman also said they were seeking an \u201curgent meeting\u201d with the Cabinet Office\u2019s permanent secretary to discuss pay.\n\nUpdated at 16.26 BST\n\n4d ago 16.13 Burnham backs Sarwar's call for metro mayors in Scotland Local champions are required across Scotland\u2019s communities in order to deliver important change, Scottish Labour has said. As PA Media reports, Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, made the call alongside Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor and former Labour MP, at the launch of a paper on local government reform in Glasgow. Sarwar suggested that Scotland could \u201clearn the lessons\u201d of the use of local and metro mayors elsewhere in the UK, and that by introducing such a system north of the border, communities would become more empowered. Burnham said introducing regional mayors in Scotland could make a \u201creal difference\u201d, adding that cities risked being left behind if they did not have enough power to do things for themselves. He said: As I look at things today, you know, it\u2019s obviously been good that Scotland\u2019s had devolution to the national level. But at the same time, I think cities potentially could get left behind if cities don\u2019t have more power to do more things for themselves. I\u2019ll give you a practical example. A week on Monday, I\u2019m introducing a cap on bus fares in Greater Manchester, so it\u2019d be a \u00a32 cap on an adult journey, \u00a31 on a child journey, and it\u2019s free for 16-18s. And then it\u2019d be \u00a35 cap on fares in a day, no matter how many buses people take. I would say, well, why shouldn\u2019t Glasgow be able to do exactly the same thing to help people through the cost of living crisis?\n\nFor 15 years, the SNP have hollowed out our local communities.\n\n\n\nWe must reset the balance with:\n\n- Fair & secure funding\n\n- Regional partnerships\n\n- Option of Mayors so we get local champions like @AndyBurnhamGM\n\n\n\nRead our plans to push power out of Holyrood: https://t.co/P7sN4mQpqk pic.twitter.com/a0qtUo1zH8 \u2014 Anas Sarwar (@AnasSarwar) August 24, 2022\n\nUpdated at 16.29 BST\n\n4d ago 16.05 Johnson pays tribute to 'incomparable will of Ukrainians to resist' at news conference in Kyiv Boris Johnson told a news conference in Kyiv that Vladimir Putin had been \u201cinsane\u201d to invade Ukraine as he praised the country\u2019s resistance.

Clive Betts, the Labour MP who chairs the levelling up committee, says that when Greg Clark replaced Michael Gove as levelling up secretary in July, he asked Betts to tell him over the summer what the committee thought of the levelling up and regeneration bill. Not much seems to be the answer. Today Betts has released the letter he has sent to Clark on behalf of his committee giving an assessment of the bill and here is the key paragraph. It is the committee\u2019s view that the main tool to achieve levelling up will be through appropriate funding to those areas that need it most. This funding will help in making progress on the levelling up missions related to public transport and local connectivity; transforming digital connectivity; improving education outcomes; increasing the number of adults who complete high quality skills training; and increasing healthy life expectancy. None of the provisions in the bill will directly contribute to making progress towards achieving these missions \u2013 other than setting them. There is also no funding for levelling up associated with the bill. Like all select committees, this one has a narrow Conservative majority. And in a statement to journalists Betts said: In its current form, the bill does little to reassure that levelling up will prove to be more than just a slogan and that we will have meaningful change in local communities across the country. In key areas, it is unclear how the government intends to drive change and they are yet to commit to the spending that is necessary to level up the country. Our inquiry has focused on the planning provisions in the bill, which can be described as loosely-connected proposals to tinker with the current system, hopefully achieving some improvement.

In a research note dated Sunday, the U.S. banking giant updated its forecasts for the consumer price index and retail price index to 18% and 21%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2023. This is based on the assumption of a \u00a3300 policy offset applied to household energy bills from October through to 2024. Energy regulator Ofgem will this week announce the scale of the next price cap increase from Oct. 1, and Citi expects a rise to \u00a33,717 per year ($4,389) from the current \u00a31,971 for an average household. The price cap essentially limits the amount a supplier can charge for their tariffs, but this limit has surged higher recently due to the rise in wholesale prices \u2014 meaning Brits have seen bills skyrocket. Market research firm Cornwall Insight recently predicted that the cap would rise to \u00a34,266 in January, while consultancy firm Auxilione forecast last week that it would exceed \u00a36,000 by the spring. Benjamin Nabarro, senior associate in the global strategy and macro group at Citi, said guidance on future increases would be the most notable aspect of this week's announcement.\n\n\"We expect further increases to \u00a34,567 in January and then \u00a35,816 in April. The risks here remain skewed to the upside,\" Nabarro said. The key question now is how government policy might impact both inflation and the real economy after a new prime minister takes office on Sept. 5. Comments so far from Conservative leadership favorite Liz Truss point to only a \"limited offset\" for headline inflation, he suggested. \"We already account for a \u00a3300 reduction in bills associated with the suspension of the Green Levy and a cut to VAT on household energy bills,\" Nabarro said. \"However, in reality any government response to this is likely to involve substantially more fiscal firepower (around \u00a340bn in our view). Offsetting the energy increase in full would cost around \u00a330bn for the coming six months (1.4% GDP).\"\n\nThe issue for inflation, he added, is that any fiscal space deployed is likely to be squeezed between weaker medium-term forecasts and the new government's desire to cut taxes, meaning disinflationary measures are \"likely somewhat further down the pecking order.\" The Bank of England earlier this month hiked interest rates by 50 basis points, its largest single increase since 1995, and projected the U.K.'s longest recession since the global financial crisis. It also forecast that inflation would peak at 13.3% in October. Citi now expects a further 125 basis points of monetary tightening at the coming three meetings of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee. U.K. inflation hit 10.1% annually in July and is increasingly expected to exceed the MPC's latest projections.", "summary": "Jim Dyson | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesLONDON \u2014 U.K. inflation is on course to exceed 18% in January as the country's energy price cap enters the stratosphere, Citi economists are projecting.\nThis is based on the assumption of a \u00a3300 policy offset applied to household energy bills from October through to 2024.\n\"We already account for a \u00a3300 reduction in bills associated with the suspension of the Green Levy and a cut to VAT on household energy bills,\" Nabarro said.\nCiti now expects a further 125 basis points of monetary tightening at the coming three meetings of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee.\nU.K. inflation hit 10.1% annually in July and is increasingly expected to exceed the MPC's latest projections."},

Now the Sun Belt Is an Inflation Vanguard.", "author": ["Jeanna Smialek"], "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/18/business/economy/sun-belt-inflation.html", "content": "That\u2019s because a less-intense version of the rent surge that is pushing inflation higher across cities in the American south is beginning to play out in bigger cities in the Northeast and on the West Coast. Real-time market rent trackers that reported prices shooting up in Sun Belt cities last year are now showing bigger increases in places like New York, San Jose and Seattle.\n\nInflation F.A.Q. Card 1 of 5 Inflation F.A.Q. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. Inflation F.A.Q. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Inflation F.A.Q. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. Inflation F.A.Q. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Inflation F.A.Q. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose market rent increases take time to trickle into official inflation figures because of the way the government calculates its data. Much as Phoenix\u2019s official inflation numbers are surging now partly because of the run-up in market rents in 2021, nascent increases in big coastal cities could keep pressure on inflation in months to come.

Nadhim Zahawi looks like being in the second category.\n\nAppointed by Boris Johnson on 5 July as he struggled in vain to remain prime minister, Zahawi is likely to be the shortest-serving chancellor since Iain Macleod died in office in 1970. Macleod was in charge of the Treasury for a month; Zahawi\u2019s tenure will probably last only twice as long.\n\nGreat things were expected of Iain Macleod when he became chancellor. Photograph: Central Press/Getty Images\n\nFunny things happen in politics. Despite all the polling evidence to the contrary, Liz Truss might not end up becoming prime minister. And even if, as expected, she sees off the challenge from Rishi Sunak, she could surprise everybody by keeping Zahawi in place.\n\nThe chancellor\u2019s aides say he is enjoying the challenge of the job and was pleased with the way a speech on financial services at the Mansion House was received.\n\nBut there is no getting away from the fact that he feels like an interim appointment, the equivalent of the caretaker football manager given the job for a few weeks while a permanent replacement is found. Even the Mansion House speech was a recommitment to a policy stance agreed under Sunak.\n\nTruss is already thinking about who she wants in her cabinet, and there have been strong rumours that she will move Kwasi Kwarteng from the business department into 11 Downing Street once she replaces Johnson. In February, the last time the energy price cap was lifted, Sunak was ready with measures to ease the burden on consumers that he could announce within hours.\n\nLiz Truss, who is in pole position to become the next UK prime minister, is already considering who she wants in her cabinet.

Zahawi\u2019s lame-duck status meant he could offer no reassurance about what extra assistance might be provided in coming months.\n\nOn average, the 26 chancellors since the second world war have lasted three years in the job but if the predictions are correct, Kwarteng will be the fourth since the 2019 general election, a high attrition rate by Treasury standards.\n\nJohn and Norma Major.

Photograph: Tony Harris/PA Archive/PA Photos\n\nThe only comparable period was 1989-93, also a time when there were four chancellors in quick succession: Nigel Lawson, John Major, Norman Lamont and Ken Clarke. Lawson resigned after a disagreement with Margaret Thatcher over economic policy; Major became prime minister after Thatcher\u2019s fall in December 1990; Lamont was made the fall guy for the pound\u2019s ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday.\n\nLamont\u2019s replacement, Clarke, ushered in a period of stability at the Treasury in which there were only four chancellors in 23 years. Clarke lost his job when Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government came to power in 1997; Brown served 10 years before taking over as prime minister just before the financial crisis began in 2007. Alistair Darling lasted just short of three years, and lost office at the 2010 general election. His successor, George Osborne, was at the Treasury until the summer of 2016, when he was fired by Theresa May.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Peter Summers/Getty Images\n\nMacleod\u2019s successor was Tony Barber who, in a competitive field, is a contender to be the worst chancellor since 1945. Under Heath\u2019s direction, Barber stoked the fires of inflation with tax cuts, spending increases and reforms of the credit system that unleashed an explosion in lending.\n\nThe tax cuts in the giveaway budget of 1972 would not, Barber insisted, lead to higher inflation but would put downward pressure on the cost of living by boosting productivity and profits.\n\nRishi Sunak, the chancellor from 2020 to 2022, published his resignation letter minutes after Sajid Javid. Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Getty Images\n\nSimilar arguments are made by Truss to justify the package of tax cuts expected in an emergency mini-budget next month, as Sunak\u2019s team has pointed out. Sunak has tried to win support for his more cautious proposals by pointing out the historical parallels between now and 50 years ago: an underlying inflationary problem, a war-induced energy crisis, and a dash for growth.\n\nThe Barber boom quickly turned to bust and, if history repeats itself, the next chancellor will face a monumental challenge.

Here\u2019s why UK beer costs are far outpacing inflation", "author": ["Elliot Smith"], "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/05/why-the-price-of-a-pint-of-beer-in-the-uk-is-going-through-the-roof.html", "content": "LONDON \u2014 The average cost of a pint of beer in the U.K. has soared by 70% since 2008 \u2014 well ahead of inflation \u2014 and some Londoners are parting with as much as \u00a38 ($9.70) for 568ml of the amber nectar. According to figures from consultancy firm CGA, the average cost of a pint has risen from \u00a32.30 in 2008 to \u00a33.95 in 2022, though prices vary drastically across locations. Average prices rose by 15 pence between 2021 and 2022, up almost 4%, one of the largest year-on-year increases since 2008. The average price of a pint at one unnamed pub in London hit an eye-watering \u00a38.06 this year, the highest CGA has ever recorded, while the lowest nationally was a \u00a31.79 average at a pub in Lancashire, in the northwest of England. U.K. inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.4% in June and is expected to rise beyond 13% in October, compounding the country's historic cost-of-living crisis and prompting the Bank of England to implement its largest interest rate hike since 1995 on Thursday. Many pubs and hospitality venues are concerned that consumers will increasingly stay at home. Paul Bolton, client director for GB drinks at CGA, told CNBC that a combination of supply chain issues, staffing shortages, soaring energy costs, lingering pandemic-era debts and generally high inflation are increasing suppliers' cost pressures, which then have to be passed onto the consumer. Raw materials and energy Francois Sonneville, senior beverage analyst at Rabobank, told CNBC that prices are increasing throughout the value chain, starting with barley. \"The barley price has gone up, and has doubled since 2021. There's two reasons for that: one is that the harvest in North America was really poor, driven by a poor climate, so there was not much inventory to start with \u2013 and then, of course, we had the Black Sea region conflict,\" he told CNBC's Arabile Gumede.\n\nA pint of Adnams Ghost Ship Citrus pale Ale. The Suffolk-based brewer says a combination of soaring energy, labor and raw material costs is squeezing businesses and driving up the price of a pint. Geography Photos/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nHistorically, when grain prices increased, farmers would compensate by planting more the following year, but broader agricultural inflation is also putting a squeeze on farms, outpacing even the 40-year high of 9.4% headline inflation in the U.K. \"Where our normal inflation is running at 8, 9%, (agricultural) inflation for our businesses is running somewhere over 22, 23%,\" explained Richard Hirst, owner of Hirst Farms in Suffolk. \"That's a function of obviously oil prices, fuel \u2013 our tractor diesel has gone up more than three times in price, which is a lot more, relatively, than road fuel has gone up.\" Hirst said the farm is also facing substantial labor cost increases, with shortages affecting the farming industry nationwide, along with fertilizer costs. \"Fertilizer costs will have tripled for next year \u2013 we're buying fertilizer now three times what it was last year. Our chemical inputs are going up and just the cost of running machinery, whether it's spare parts or actually just the cost of buying machinery itself. All that has gone up an awful lot more than the 9 or 10% of normal inflation.\"\n\nHowever, barley is not the main cost incurred during the brewing process \u2013 in fact, it only contributes around 5% of the price of beer at the tap. The biggest costs, analysts and business leaders told CNBC, come from labor, packaging and energy. \"I think that if you look at the brewing process itself, it uses a lot of energy \u2013 and the energy price has gone up, as we all know, when we stop at the pump \u2013 but the most important one is probably packaging,\" Sonneville said. \"Packaging makes up about 25 to 30% of the cost price of beer, and glass packaging, glass bottles, use about 25% of their cost in energy, so with gas prices going 10 times higher now than they were two years ago, that has a massive impact on the cost of a brewer.\" Labor of love His comments were echoed by Andy Wood, CEO of Suffolk-based brewery and hospitality business Adnams, who told CNBC that the energy price increases the company is seeing are \"absolutely eye-watering.\" \"Brewing beer or distilling spirits involves a lot of boiling water, so that involves lots of energy to get to that state, although we've put quite a number of innovations in over the years to limit the impact of that,\" he explained. Wood said in the aftermath of Brexit and the pandemic, a tightening of the U.K. labor market is also exerting upward wage pressure, which will likely be exacerbated by the country's escalating cost-of-living crisis. \"The biggest cost that we have is our payroll because the hospitality part of that business is a people-driven business,\" he added. What's more, the geopolitical headwinds facing businesses throughout the supply chain are unlikely to abate any time soon.\n\n\"So we've got Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we've got the energy crisis that that's brought on, we've got the food supply crisis, grain, cooking oils, these types of things, and then \u2026 we hear in the media that China may be looking longingly at Taiwan, so I think the geopolitical situation is getting no easier, so I think these things are here to stay,\" he said. The question for businesses, according to both Wood and Sonneville, is how many of these costs they can absorb, how much should be passed onto consumers, and in the midst of a cost of living crisis, how to sustain margins without forcing the consumer to stay at home and jeopardizing volumes. Brewers tend to have long-term contracts and hedges in place to ensure contingency plans for future price rises, meaning not all of their costs are fully reflected at present, and therefore not immediately passed onto consumers. \"I think if you look at the price of beer that you and I pay, there is a risk that that will go higher, because there is a lagging effect of costs at the brewery because of those long-term contracts,\" Sonneville said on Monday. \"The hope that I think is there at brewers is that prices will come down. We have not seen that in gas \u2014 we've seen more sanctions there and gas prices have actually risen in the last three days \u2014 but we have seen that grain prices have come off a little bit, and the hope is that that will continue.\" Shifting trends Wood noted that consumer sentiment and behavior had already begun to shift in the face of higher prices at the bar. \"We're certainly seeing people come out earlier in the evening, having their drinks, having their dinner, and then they're going back home,\" he said. \"We're seeing people perhaps having two courses rather than three courses, and perhaps having a glass of wine rather than a bottle of wine, so we are seeing some changes in consumer behavior, there is no doubt about that.\" This was reflected in CGA's latest consumer analysis, which found that premium products and venues offering particularly unique experiences were increasing their share of the on-trade.", "summary": "Average prices rose by 15 pence between 2021 and 2022, up almost 4%, one of the largest year-on-year increases since 2008.\nThe Suffolk-based brewer says a combination of soaring energy, labor and raw material costs is squeezing businesses and driving up the price of a pint.\nHirst said the farm is also facing substantial labor cost increases, with shortages affecting the farming industry nationwide, along with fertilizer costs.\n\"Fertilizer costs will have tripled for next year \u2013 we're buying fertilizer now three times what it was last year.\nLabor of love His comments were echoed by Andy Wood, CEO of Suffolk-based brewery and hospitality business Adnams, who told CNBC that the energy price increases the company is seeing are \"absolutely eye-watering.\""},

Scott Mlyn | CNBC\n\nIt wasn't long ago that Amazon, Shopify and Peloton doubled their workforces to manage through the pandemic surge, while Morgan Stanley staffed up to handle a record level of IPOs, and mortgage lenders added headcount as rock-bottom rates led to a refinancing boom. On the flipside, Delta Air Lines, Hilton Worldwide and legions of restaurants slashed headcount because of lockdowns that rolled through much of the country and other parts of the world. Now, they're scrambling to reverse course. Companies that hired like crazy in 2020 and 2021 to meet customer demand are being forced to make sweeping cuts or impose hiring freezes with a possible recession on the horizon. In a matter of months, CEOs have gone from hypergrowth mode to concerns over \"macroeconomic uncertainty,\" a phrase investors have heard many times on second-quarter earnings calls. Stock trading app Robinhood and crypto exchange Coinbase both recently slashed more than 1,000 jobs after their splashy market debuts in 2021. Meanwhile, airlines, hotels and eateries face the opposite problem as their businesses continue to pick up following the era of Covid-induced shutdowns. After instituting mass layoffs early in the pandemic, they can't hire quickly enough to satisfy demand and are dealing with a labor market radically different from the one they experienced over two years ago, before the cutbacks. \"The pandemic created very unique, once-in-a-lifetime conditions in many different industries that caused a dramatic reallocation of capital,\" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at job recruiting site ZipRecruiter. \"Many of those conditions no longer apply so you're seeing a reallocation of capital back to more normal patterns.\"\n\nFor employers, those patterns are particularly challenging to navigate, because inflation levels have jumped to a 40-year high, and the Fed has lifted its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point on consecutive occasions for the first time since the early 1990s. The central bank's efforts to tamp down inflation have raised concerns that the U.S. economy is headed for recession. Gross domestic product has fallen for two straight quarters, hitting a widely accepted rule of thumb for recession, though the National Bureau of Economic Research hasn't yet made that declaration. The downward trend was bound to happen eventually, and market experts lamented the frothiness in stock prices and absurdity of valuations as late as the fourth quarter of last year, when the major indexes hit record highs led by the riskiest assets. That was never more evident than in November, when electric vehicle maker Rivian went public on almost no revenue and quickly reached a market cap of over $150 billion. Bitcoin hit a record the same day, touching close to $69,000. Since then, bitcoin is off by two-thirds, and Rivian has lost about 80% of its value. In July, the car company started layoffs of about 6% of its workforce. Rivian's headcount almost quintupled to around 14,000 between late 2020 and mid-2022.\n\nTech layoffs and an air of caution\n\nJob cuts and hiring slowdowns were big talking points on tech earnings calls last week. Amazon reduced its headcount by 99,000 people to 1.52 million employees at the end of the second quarter after almost doubling in size during the pandemic, when it needed to beef up its warehouse capabilities. Shopify, whose cloud technology helps retailers build and manage online stores, cut about 1,000 workers, or around 10% of its global workforce. The company doubled its headcount over a two-year period starting at the beginning of 2020, as the business boomed from the number or stores and restaurants that had to suddenly go digital. Shopify CEO Tobias Lutke said in a memo to employees that the company had wagered that the pandemic surge would cause the transition from physical retail to ecommerce to \"permanently leap ahead by 5 or even 10 years.\" \"It's now clear that bet didn't pay off,\" Lutke wrote, adding that the picture was starting to look more like it did before Covid. \"Ultimately, placing this bet was my call to make and I got this wrong. Now, we have to adjust.\" After Facebook parent Meta missed on its results and forecast a second straight quarter of declining revenue, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will be reducing job growth over the next year. Headcount expanded by about 60% during the pandemic. \"This is a period that demands more intensity and I expect us to get more done with fewer resources,\" Zuckerberg said. Google parent Alphabet, which grew its workforce by over 30% during the two Covid years, recently told employees that they needed to focus and improve productivity. The company asked for suggestions on how to be more efficient at work.\n\n\"It's clear we are facing a challenging macro environment with more uncertainty ahead,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said in a meeting with employees. \"We should think about how we can minimize distractions and really raise the bar on both product excellence and productivity.\" Few U.S. companies have been hit as hard as Peloton, whose fitness equipment and on-demand classes became an instant gym replacement during lockdowns and which has since suffered from massive oversupply issues and out-of-control costs. After doubling headcount in the 12 months ended June 30, 2021, the company in February announced plans to cut 20% of corporate positions as it named a new CEO.\n\nBanks and Wall Street bracing for a 'hurricane'\n\nSome of the Peloton products that were flying off the shelves in the pandemic were being offered as perks for overworked junior bankers, who were sorely needed to help manage a boom in IPOs, mergers and stock issuance. Activity picked up with such ferocity that junior bankers were complaining about 100-hour workweeks, and banks started scouting for talent in unusual places like consulting and accounting firms. That helps explain why the six biggest U.S. banks added a combined 59,757 employees from the start of 2020 through the middle of 2022, the equivalent of the industry picking up the full population of a Morgan Stanley or a Goldman Sachs in a little over two years. It wasn't just investment banking. The government unleashed trillions of dollars in stimulus payments and small business loans designed to keep the economy moving amid the widespread shutdowns. A feared wave of loan defaults never arrived, and banks instead took in an unprecedented flood of deposits. Their Main Street lending operations had better repayment rates than before the pandemic. Among top banks, Morgan Stanley saw the biggest jump in headcount, with its employee levels expanding 29% to 78,386 from early 2020 to the middle of this year. The growth was fueled in part by CEO James Gorman\u2019s acquisitions of money management firms E-Trade and Eaton Vance. At rival investment bank Goldman Sachs, staffing levels jumped 22% to 47,000 in the same time frame, as CEO David Solomon broke into consumer finance and bolstered wealth management operations, including through the acquisition of fintech lender GreenSky. Citigroup saw a 15% boost in headcount during the pandemic, while JPMorgan Chase added 8.5% to its workforce, becoming the industry's largest employer. But the good times on Wall Street didn\u2019t last. The stock market had its worst first half in 50 years, and IPOs dried up. Investment banking revenue at the major players declined sharply in the second quarter. Goldman Sachs responded by slowing hiring and is considering a return to year-end job reductions, according to a person with knowledge of the bank\u2019s plans. Employees typically make up the single biggest line item when it comes to expenses in banking, so when markets crater, layoffs are usually on the horizon. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in June that an economic \"hurricane\" was on its way, and said the bank was bracing itself for volatile markets.\n\nJamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., during a Bloomberg Television interview in London, U.K., on Wednesday, May 4, 2022. Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nZipRecruiter's Pollak said one area in finance where there will likely be a hemorrhaging of workers is in mortgage lending. She said 60% more people went into real estate in 2020 and 2021 because of record low mortgage rates and rising home prices. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo have reportedly trimmed hundreds of mortgage staffers as volumes collapsed. \"Nobody is refinancing anymore, and sales are slowing,\" Pollak said. \"You're going to have to see employment levels and hiring slow down. That growth was all about that moment.\" The intersection of Silicon Valley and Wall Street is a particularly gloomy place at the moment as rising rates and crumbling stock multiples converge. Crypto trading platform Coinbase in June announced plans to lay off 18% of its workforce in preparation for a \"crypto winter\" and even rescinded job offers to people it had hired. Headcount tripled in 2021 to 3,730 employees. Stock trading app Robinhood said Tuesday it's cutting about 23% of its workforce, a little over three months after eliminating 9% of its full-time staff, which had ballooned from 2,100 to 3,800 in the last nine months of 2021. \"We are at the tail end of that pandemic-era distortion,\" said Aaron Terrazas, chief economist at job search and review site Glassdoor. \"Obviously, it's not going away, but it is changing to a more normalized period, and companies are adapting to this new reality.\"\n\nRetail is whipsawing back and forth\n\nNurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThey hardly could have predicted how quickly the dynamic would shift, as rapid and soaring inflation forced Americans to tighten their belts. Retailers have already started to warn of waning demand, leaving them with bloated inventories. Gap said higher promotions will hurt gross margins in its fiscal second quarter. Kohl's cut its guidance for the second quarter, citing softened consumer spending. Walmart last week slashed its profit forecast and said surging prices for food and gas are squeezing consumers. That pain is filtering into the ad market. Online bulletin board Pinterest on Monday cited \"lower than expected demand from U.S. big box retailers and mid-market advertisers\" as one reason why it missed Wall Street estimates for second-quarter earnings and revenue. Retail giants have so far avoided big layoff announcements, but smaller players are in cut mode. Stitch Fix, 7-Eleven and Game Stop have said they'll be eliminating jobs, and outdoor grill maker Weber warned it's considering layoffs as sales slow.\n\nThe travel industry can't hire fast enough\n\nWith all of the downsizing taking place across wide swaths of the U.S. economy, the applicant pool should be wide open for airlines, restaurants and hospitality companies, which are trying to repopulate their ranks after undergoing mass layoffs when Covid hit. It's not so easy. Even though Amazon has reduced headcount of late, it's still got far more people working in its warehouses than it did two years ago. Last year the company lifted average starting pay to $18 an hour, a level that's difficult to meet for much of the services industry. Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta said on the quarterly earnings call in May that he wasn't satisfied with customer service and that the company needs more workers. At the end of last year, even as travel was rebounding sharply, headcount at Hilton's managed, owned and leased properties as well as corporate locations was down by over 30,000 from two years earlier. It's easy to see why customer service is a challenge. According to a report last week from McKinsey on summer 2022 travel trends, revenue per available room in the U.S. \"is outstripping not just 2020 and 2021 levels, but increasingly 2019 levels too.\"\n\nDelta Airlines passenger jets are pictured outside the newly completed 1.3 million-square foot $4 billion Delta Airlines Terminal C at LaGuardia Airport in New York, June 1, 2022.

Rather than raking in fixed fees, Kraus' $3.8 billion firm operates on a fee structure linked to performance, charging 30 percent of alpha. That's higher than the industry standard but since inception, about half of Aperture's funds have delivered alpha above their benchmarks. Kraus sat down with CNBC's Delivering Alpha newsletter to explain why he's focused on a pay-for-performance set-up and how he's putting capital to work in the current environment.\n\n(The below has been edited for length and clarity. See above for full video.)\n\nLeslie Picker: What do you see as the key problem with the traditional model? And what do you think is the best way to fix it?\n\nPeter Kraus: The key problem is very simple. The existing model in almost all cases, rewards people whether or not they perform. So, it's a fixed fee and as assets grow, you earn more money. Well, clients don't actually hire us to grow our assets, they hire us to perform. So, you would think the performance fee or the actual fee would be connected to the performance as opposed to the asset growth. We also know that asset growth is the enemy of performance. It's harder and harder to perform, the more assets that you manage. So, the fee doesn't help you - that traditional fee doesn't help in that regard, because the manager is incentivized to continue to grow assets, and that makes it harder and harder to perform.\n\nOf course, there are performance fees in the marketplace and hedge funds and private equity, but they also have rather large management fees. So, they too have some incentive to grow their assets. Basically Aperture is the anathema to that - it's the opposite. We charge a very low base fee that's equal to the ETF and then we only charge if we beat the index. So, you pay for performance. If we don't have any performance, you pay what you pay to buy the ETF.\n\nPicker: So, then how do you choose which index is relevant for the specific strategies?. I mean, do you invest in certain ways that would mirror or would be comparable to certain indexes that you're able to then outperform?\n\nKraus: Exactly. So, we're very, very thoughtful about the index because we're actually charging people to beat the index. So, for example, in global equities, we would use the MSCI global equity index. For U.S. small cap, we would use the Russell 2000. For European equities, we would use the Euro Stoxx Index. Very simple indices, not complex, no real question about whether the manager is actually creating a portfolio that is following that index. In fact, we actually test the correlation of the portfolio to the index to make sure the index continues to be relevant.\n\nPicker: People who advocate for their management fee will say that it's necessary, essentially, to keep the lights on - that it basically ensures that the operations of the fund can meet all of their fixed costs and cover their expenses. How are you able to do so with a lower management fee?\n\nKraus: People say, well, I need to keep the lights on. Well, okay, how many assets do you need to keep the lights on? And once you have the lights on, then do you need to keep charging the fixed fee? Because your incentive is just to continue to gather assets. So, it's really a function of how many assets we have and we've created a company where we think that assets scale pretty much speaks for revenues to cover the fixed expenses. And then the rest is only earned if we perform. One of the things that I like about Aperture is that I'm incentivized, as the owner of the business identically with the client. I don't make much money, if any money, unless we actually perform.\n\nPicker: What about your ability to recruit and pay employees? Does it have any bearing on compensation?\n\nKraus: Sure does. The portfolio managers are paid a strict percentage of the performance fee. So, portfolio managers are usually paid 35% of the 30% that we charge. We charge a 30% performance fee and we pay the management, to the portfolio managers and their team, 35% of that. And we've selected that percentage because we think that that is highly competitive with both the hedge fund industry as well as the long-only industry. And if managers perform on the amount of capital that they have, their compensation can be quite attractive. And that's, in effect, how we believe we can attract some of the best talent in the marketplace.\n\nPicker: It doesn't appear though, at least in the current environment, that LPs are too dissuaded by the traditional model. I mean, there were nearly 200 hedge fund launches in Q1 outpacing the number of liquidations. AUM stands around $4 trillion for the hedge fund industry overall. So, it doesn't appear that LPS have really been pushing back, at least in terms of new launches and total AUM size. So, I'm just curious kind of what your conversations have been like on that front?\n\nKraus: Well, there's $4 trillion in the hedge fund community but there's $32 trillion in the long-only community. And I don't think that it's a question that is hard to answer. If you look at the trend between the active management industry and the passive industry, money's been moving to the passive industry at a rapid pace - unchanged for 10 years. And the hedge fund space, the $4 trillion - we're talking about all sorts of different types of hedge funds, for sure, it's not a monolithic industry. But essentially, most managers or most allocators that I speak to would rather not pay a performance fee times the beta that their money is exposed to. They would like to pay a performance fee for actually the performance. And so, we offer that clarity, which many hedge funds do not. And in the long-only space, there's virtually no payment for performance. It's almost all fixed.\n\nPicker: Since there's so much on the line with regard to performance, I have to ask you, what's your strategy? What's your what's your thinking right now? How are you putting capital to work in the current environment in a way that you believe will outperform the benchmarks?\n\nKraus: It depends upon the strategy, whether it's an equity strategy or fixed income strategy. But in the equity strategies, we are what you would expect - highly research dependent, looking for specific opportunities with companies that we think have long term growth, or undervalue and will accelerate their value over time. And that timeframe is usually 18 months to three years. In the credit space, again, it's fundamental research to find credits and obviously being careful about the market because credit markets tend to be more macro driven. But it's all of the above and that's what we spend our time doing. We think that if we do that consistently over time, we can perform.\n\nPicker: Are you net long or net short in the current environment?\n\nKraus: Interestingly enough, in the one hedge fund that we do run, we're pretty close to flat. So, I would say a very low net position. In the other funds that we run, we run 100% long. So, in other words, we are what I call beta one, exposed to the index by 100%. But we do have shorts, so we're gross more than 100% in those funds. But I would say in general, right now, our risk positions are low.\n\nPicker: So, not much leverage then?\n\nKraus: Not much leverage, but more importantly, the actual stocks and bonds that we are choosing and the positions we're taking, we're on, I would say, the low end of our risk scale.", "summary": "And we've selected that percentage because we think that that is highly competitive with both the hedge fund industry as well as the long-only industry.\nI mean, there were nearly 200 hedge fund launches in Q1 outpacing the number of liquidations.\nAUM stands around $4 trillion for the hedge fund industry overall.\nKraus: Well, there's $4 trillion in the hedge fund community but there's $32 trillion in the long-only community.\nKraus: Interestingly enough, in the one hedge fund that we do run, we're pretty close to flat."},

The group last week approved a second consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase to the Fed's benchmark borrowing rate.\n\nThat message of continued rate hikes is consistent with other Fed speakers this week , including regional presidents Loretta Mester of Cleveland, Charles Evans of Chicago and Mary Daly of San Francisco. Each said Tuesday that the inflation fight is far from over and more monetary policy tightening will be needed.\n\n\"I think we'll probably have to be higher for longer in order to get the evidence that we need to see that inflation is actually turning around on all dimensions and in a convincing way coming lower, not just a tick lower here and there,\" Bullard said during a live \" Squawk Box \" interview on CNBC.\n\nThe central bank official said he expects another 1.5 percentage points or so in interest rate increases this year as the Fed continues to battle the highest inflation levels since the early 1980s.\n\nSt. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Wednesday that the central bank will continue raising rates until it sees compelling evidence that inflation is falling.\n\nIf Bullard has his way, the rate will continue rising to a range of 3.75%-4% by the end of the year. After starting 2022 near zero, the rate has now come up to a range of 2.25%-2.5%.\n\nConsumer price inflation is running at a 12-month rate of 9.1%, its highest since November 1981. Even throwing out the highs and lows of inflation, as the Dallas Fed does with its \"trimmed mean\" estimate, inflation is running at 4.3%.\n\n\"We're going to have to see convincing evidence across the board, headline and other measures of core inflation, all coming down convincingly before we'll be able to feel like we're doing our job,\" Bullard said.\n\nThe rate hikes come at a time of slowing growth in the U.S., which has seen consecutive quarters of negative GDP readings, a common definition of recession. However, Bullard said he doesn't think the economy is really in recession.\n\n\"We're not in a recession right now. We do have these two quarters of negative GDP growth. To some extent, a recession is in the eyes of the beholder,\" he said. \"With all the job growth in the first half of the year, it's hard to say there's a recession.
