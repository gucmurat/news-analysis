German power prices surged +18.60% to another record as well, closing at \u20ac663 and breaching \u20ac700/MWH intraday for the first time ever.\n\nThis summer\u2019s heatwaves have already strained Europe\u2019s energy supplies. Such high prices will hurt households badly, while disruption during the winter months could be devastating for business activity.\n\nTapas Strickland, a director of economics at National Australia Bank, says:\n\n\u201cEurope\u2019s dire energy situation suggests the peak of inflation is not here yet and the risk remains that high inflation is sticky for longer without further aggressive central bank action. \u201cNo surprise then to see the dollar at near multi-decade highs against a falling euro and British pound.\u201d\n\nthis is looking exponential now: pic.twitter.com/5eGpdCC6Ac \u2014 BionicBanker (@BrokenBanker) August 22, 2022\n\nWhile energy shortage fears hit the euro, the dollar is in demand.

Earlier this month the Bank of England said it expected inflation to reach 13% by the end of the year, while the Resolution Foundation thinktank has forecast it could reach as high as 15% by early 2023.\n\nThe last time UK inflation reached 18% was in 1976 when an oil supply shock ripped through the global economy and left the UK seeking a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe climbing forecasts have put pressure on the Conservative leadership candidates to say how they would tackle inflation. Liz Truss released a plan to \u201cput the West Midlands at the heart of our economic revival\u201d on Monday night, without mentioning inflation. Rishi Sunak set out his own plans to make the UK a science superpower and to replace the Horizon research programme, from which Britain has been frozen out after Brexit. But his campaign had earlier warned that Truss\u2019s plans for tax cuts could create an \u201cinflation spiral\u201d.\n\nLabour said inflation was a global problem but \u201cworse in the UK than elsewhere due to Conservative mismanagement over the past 12 years\u201d.\n\nPat McFadden, the shadow Treasury minister, said: \u201cWith each passing day there is a new survey saying energy prices will rise even higher than expected and with them, inflation too. People simply cannot afford the rises projected to hit them in the coming months. That is why Labour has proposed freezing energy bills over the coming winter, saving households \u00a31,000 and protecting them from rocketing prices.\u201d\n\nCiti is highly regarded for its economic forecasting, working with the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank on its regular \u201cgreen budget\u201d analysis.\n\nBenjamin Nabarro, the chief UK economist at Citi, said its forecasts had been updated after a 25% and 7% rise in UK gas and electricity prices respectively last week.\n\nConditions in the gas market worsened on Monday in response to Russian state-owned operator Gazprom announcing unscheduled maintenance on the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline into Europe.\n\nThe price of gas for next-day delivery to the UK shot up 37% to 495p a therm at one point, the highest since March. The month-ahead gas price touched record highs, up 16% to 540p a therm.\n\nIn Europe, the gas price according to the TTF benchmark rose more than 10% to a high of \u20ac290 (\u00a3245) a megawatt hour, and in France the year-ahead electricity price surged to more than \u20ac800 a megawatt hour, up from just over \u20ac100 at the start of the year.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ofgem, the energy regulator for Great Britain, will announce the level of the next price cap on Friday.\n\nThe US bank predicted that the cap would rise to \u00a34,567 in January \u2013 about \u00a3300 higher than some forecasts \u2013 before reaching \u00a35,816 in April.\n\nEnergy bills have rocketed this year as high wholesale gas prices, in part down to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, have fed through into bills.\n\nThe government is examining options to tackle the crisis, including ramping up an existing support package, which gives \u00a3400 to every household from October, and a \u201ctariff deficit scheme\u201d pushed by suppliers.\n\nBill Bullen, the chief executive of Utilita, on Monday called for the Conservative party to end its leadership contest early so that the energy crisis could be tackled immediately.\n\nCiti said it expected at least a \u00a3300 reduction in bills as a result of an anticipated cut to VAT on household energy bills and a suspending of green levies on bills.\n\nHowever, it added: \u201cIn reality, any government response to this is likely to involve substantially more fiscal firepower (around \u00a340bn in our view).\u201d\n\nCiti analysts said offsetting the energy increase in full would cost \u00a330bn, equivalent to 1.4% GDP, for the next six months. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has presented a \u00a329bn plan to freeze bills for six months.\n\nAnalysts at RBC said global gas traders including Shell would benefit from higher prices, as well as the power station owner Drax and the energy group SSE.\n\nOn Monday, Europe was due to receive its first cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Australia in six years, arriving at the Isle of Grain terminal in Kent. The Attalos gas tanker was poised to bring in LNG for use immediately in the UK as well as export to Europe.\n\nAsked about the possibility of blackouts this winter, Downing Street downplayed concerns. A No 10 spokesperson said: \u201cHouseholds, businesses and industry can be confident they will get the electricity and gas that they need over the winter. That\u2019s because we have one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems in the world.\u201d\n\nShe said consumers should not panic or feel they should cut down on energy use. \u201cThese decisions, in terms of energy consumption, remain decisions for individuals.

The investment firm prefers mainland China stocks to those listed offshore, equity strategist Laura Wang said in an Aug. 15 report about the bank's positioning in Chinese equities in the third quarter. Mainland China's CSI 300 index has outperformed the MSCI China stock index by 20 percentage points since mid-November, she said. MSCI China's top holdings are Chinese stocks listed mostly in Hong Kong, such as Tencent and Alibaba . Wang noted how the MSCI China index is most sensitive to sectors affected by regulatory uncertainty, and is experiencing its longest bear market in its 20-year history. She expects the property market slump , downward earnings revisions, potential Covid outbreaks and uncertainty around U.S.-China tensions to likely keep market volatility elevated. In the interim, she said the firm recommends remaining overweight on materials companies. \"We also like information technology, which enjoys a continuous policy tailwind, and Utilities for defensiveness,\" Wang said.

Brandon Bell | Getty Images\n\nJuly's consumer price index report finally showed a sign of potential relief \u2013 inflation ticked up less than expected from a year ago, and was flat on the month, meaning that a basket of items and services generally stayed the same price. But some items have fallen, on a monthly and weekly basis, potentially signaling that inflation has passed its peak and may be cooling off. This is welcome news to consumers who have been squeezed by higher prices and are looking for any sign of relief. Some of the top items whose prices have come down include eggs, milk and gasoline.\n\n\"Fuel inflation was really big and that's going to have a pretty meaningful impact on consumers and their spending patterns,\" said John Leer, chief economist at Morning Consult. \"I think that's actually a good thing for the economy.\"\n\nGrocery aisle prices down\n\nMany of the items that have declined are tied to food and energy, often the most volatile costs that consumers deal with. Grocery store staples have dipped. Large white eggs cost, on average, $2.14 for a dozen, during the week of Aug. 15-21, according to the USDA. That's a whopping 60 cent drop from the prior week, when the average was $2.74 per dozen.\n\nThe average price for a gallon of milk slipped to $3.16 from $3.24 during the period of Aug. 8-12 from the previous month, and the average price of butter fell to $3.67 from $4.68 in the same timeframe, per USDA data. Chicken breast prices also slipped on a weekly basis during the period of Aug. 8-12, but other parts of the chicken are declining as well \u2013 chicken wing prices have been trending down and are now cost less than they did pre-pandemic, according to data from the Department of Agriculture.\n\nOil pulled down fuel prices\n\nOutside of food, declines can be seen in consumer goods and services related to energy. This is because oil prices are often subject to big price swings as the balance between supply and demand shifts. This year, the war between Russia and Ukraine threw that balance off and the price of oil spiked when countries stopped buying from Russia, a major exporter. However, oil prices have come back down, lowering the cost of energy and particularly gasoline. The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline is $3.918 as of Friday, according to AAA. While that's higher than it was a year ago, it's a solid decline from the $4.495 consumers were paying for gas a month ago, and a sharp drop from the recent high of $5.016 hit in June.\n\nI think consumers increasingly believe that inflation is going to come down. John Leer chief economist at Morning Consult\n\nThat also potentially affected another area of the economy that saw a price dip month over month \u2013 airfares. The average price of a domestic airline ticket has dropped to $295 in August from $332 in July, according to travel site Hopper. That's also back in-line with the average price for a domestic ticket in the same month in 2019. Outside of fuel costs, this dip in ticket prices could be because consumer demand is fading, according to according to Kevin Gordon, a senior investment research manager at Schwab. \"That could be demand destruction,\" he said, adding that the reopening from pandemic lockdowns inflated the price of things as consumers rushed to take vacations again. Now, as vacation season is winding down, that demand has fallen off.\n\nOne month doesn't make a trend", "summary": "But some items have fallen, on a monthly and weekly basis, potentially signaling that inflation has passed its peak and may be cooling off.\nThis is welcome news to consumers who have been squeezed by higher prices and are looking for any sign of relief.\nSome of the top items whose prices have come down include eggs, milk and gasoline.\nThe average price of a domestic airline ticket has dropped to $295 in August from $332 in July, according to travel site Hopper.\nThat's also back in-line with the average price for a domestic ticket in the same month in 2019."},

Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. Inflation F.A.Q. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Inflation F.A.Q. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. Inflation F.A.Q. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Inflation F.A.Q. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe last two years was great for retailers because consumers were buying everything they had to offer,\u201d Liza Amlani, founder of Retail Strategy Group, which works with brands on their merchandising and planning strategies. \u201cThey just can\u2019t do that anymore.

The End Fuel Poverty Coalition has warned \"a tsunami of fuel poverty will hit the country this winter.\" Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nLONDON \u2014 Facing soaring energy bills, rising costs and rapidly declining consumer purchasing power, small businesses across the U.K. are struggling to make ends meet. New data on Wednesday showed U.K. inflation jumped to a 40-year high of 10.1% in July as food and energy costs continued to soar, exacerbating the country's cost-of-living crisis. The Bank of England expects consumer price inflation to top out at 13.3% in October, with the country's average energy bills (set via a price cap) expected to rise sharply in the fourth quarter to eventually exceed an annual \u00a34,266 ($5,170) in early 2023. On Wednesday, a director of U.K. energy regulator Ofgem quit over its decision to add hundreds of pounds to household bills, accusing the watchdog of failing to strike the \"right balance between the interests of consumers and the interests of suppliers.\" Real wages in the U.K. fell by an annual 3% in the second quarter of 2022, the sharpest decline on record, as wage increases failed to keep pace with the surging cost of living. A new survey published Friday also showed consumer confidence falling to its lowest level since records began in 1974. 'Absolute madness' \"While the energy price caps do not apply to businesses directly, millions of small business owners are still experiencing increased energy bills at a time when costs are rising in most operational areas,\" said Alan Thomas, U.K. CEO at insurance firm Simply Business. \"Simultaneously, consumer purchasing power is going down as Brits cut back on non-essential spending, harming the books of SME [small and medium-sized enterprise] owners.\" This assessment was echoed by Christopher Gammon, e-commerce manager at Lincs Aquatics \u2014 a Lincolnshire-based store and warehouse providing aquariums, ponds and marine livestock. The business has seen its energy costs rise by 90% so far since the war in Ukraine began, Gammon told CNBC on Thursday, and its owners are provisioning for further increases in the coming months.\n\n\"We are combating the rising cost with switching everything to LED, solar panels, wind turbines (planning in process) and closing down unused systems,\" Gammon said. \"We have also had to increase the price of products \u2014 most of these have been livestock as they are now costing more to look after.\" Customers are increasingly withdrawing from keeping fish and reptiles due to the cost of maintenance, and on Wednesday the store had a customer bring in a snake they could no longer afford to care for. The spiraling costs forced Lincs Aquatics to close a store in East Yorkshire, laying off several workers, while trying to offer pay rises to staff at its two remaining locations in Lincolnshire in order to help them through the crisis. The business is also working to expand its online shop due to rising in-store upkeep costs, as heating water for marine aquariums and purchasing pump equipment become ever more expensive. In early July, a quarterly survey from the British Chambers of Commerce found that 82% of businesses in the U.K. saw inflation as a growing concern for their business, with growth in sales, investment intentions and longer-term turnover confidence all slowing.\n\n\"Businesses face an unprecedented convergence of cost pressures, with the main drivers coming from raw materials, fuel, utilities, taxes, and labor,\" said BCC Head of Research David Bharier. \"The continuing supply chain crisis, exacerbated by conflict in Ukraine and lockdowns in China, has further compounded this.\" BCC Director General Shevaun Haviland added that \"the red lights on our economic dashboard are starting to flash,\" with almost every indicator deteriorating since the March survey. Phil Speed, an independent distributor for multiservice company Utility Warehouse, based in Skegness, England, liaises with brokers to find energy deals for business clients. He told CNBC earlier this week that for the first time in 10 years, he had been unable to obtain a better deal for a client than their out-of-contract rate \u2014 the typically expensive rates paid when a business or individual does not have a contracted deal in place. \"I think the unit rate she was quoting was 60p [pence] a unit for gas, which is just ridiculous. I'd imagine a year ago, we'd have been looking at 5 or 6p. It's just absolute madness,\" Speed said. \"We've got no idea what's going to be presented to us, because we've got no idea what's going to happen. The price is just going ballistic. No-one's going to buy it.\" The cost of gas for both businesses and consumers are only expected to increase through the colder winter months. Speed noted that local cafes cooking on gas will likely struggle, as they have no choice but to continue using it, unless they can replace gas appliances with electric ones. 'Scream very loudly at somebody' Rail strikes have already brought the country to a halt on multiple days throughout the summer and look set to continue, while postal workers, telecoms engineers and dock workers have all voted to strike as inflation erodes real wages. Conservative leadership favorite Liz Truss was earlier this month forced into a dramatic U-turn on a plan to cut public sector pay outside London, which would have axed wages for teachers, nurses, police and the armed forces alike. Local authorities recently offered state school support staff a flat pay rise of \u00a31,925 per year, meaning a 10.5% increase for the lowest-paid staff and just over 4% for the highest earners, after pressure from three of the country's largest unions. One woman in her early fifties \u2013 a member of support staff at a state school in Lincolnshire who asked not to be named due to the sensitive situation and concerns on public reprisals \u2013 told CNBC that years of real-terms pay cuts had left many low-paid public sector workers struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe British government in 2010, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, announced a two-year pay freeze for public sector workers, followed by a 1% average cap on public sector pay awards which was lifted in 2017, with average pay rises increasing to roughly 2% by 2020. While the 10.5% rise for the lowest-paid school support staff will ease the pressure, the woman said her energy costs had doubled and her private landlord had attempted to increase her rent by \u00a340 per month, which she had not agreed to and which may mean she would need to sell her car to cover basic living expenses. She called on the government to temporarily reduce the \"standing charge,\" a fixed daily amount households have to pay on most gas and electricity bills no matter how much they actually use, and to up its efforts to recoup one-off \"windfall taxes\" from energy companies such as BP, Shell and Centrica, which are reporting record profits.. \"I think this is an even bigger crisis than [the Covid-19 pandemic], because this is going to affect not just lower earners, but maybe even middle earners as well, because I don't see how anybody can absorb those kinds of energy costs,\" she said.", "summary": "Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLONDON \u2014 Facing soaring energy bills, rising costs and rapidly declining consumer purchasing power, small businesses across the U.K. are struggling to make ends meet.\nNew data on Wednesday showed U.K. inflation jumped to a 40-year high of 10.1% in July as food and energy costs continued to soar, exacerbating the country's cost-of-living crisis.\nOn Wednesday, a director of U.K. energy regulator Ofgem quit over its decision to add hundreds of pounds to household bills, accusing the watchdog of failing to strike the \"right balance between the interests of consumers and the interests of suppliers.\"\n'Absolute madness' \"While the energy price caps do not apply to businesses directly, millions of small business owners are still experiencing increased energy bills at a time when costs are rising in most operational areas,\" said Alan Thomas, U.K. CEO at insurance firm Simply Business.\nThe business has seen its energy costs rise by 90% so far since the war in Ukraine began, Gammon told CNBC on Thursday, and its owners are provisioning for further increases in the coming months."},

Big spending decisions are being delayed until his successor as prime minister is in post. However, the result of the Conservative leadership election will not be announced until 5 September.\n\nIn the meantime, a major increase in the regulated energy price cap, which puts a ceiling on gas and electricity bills, is due to be announced this Friday. It is forecast to rise from just under \u00a32,000, to \u00a33,600 a year for the average household.\n\nWhile the nation waits to hear whether any further help is coming, the Treasury is working on a menu of options. Here we outline the main ideas, and assess the political and economic impact of each one.\n\nTargeted help for the most vulnerable\n\nThe most limited option for the Treasury is to direct additional help for households to those on the lowest incomes, many of whom are already in fuel poverty and struggling even before the bill increases come in this winter. More than half of British households, 54%, will be in fuel poverty by October and more still in January.\n\nThe most targeted way of getting money to the most vulnerable is via increases in universal credit and pension credit. Liz Truss has also promised to reverse the national insurance rise \u2013 though many poorer households were not affected by that because the last cost of living intervention by Rishi Sunak as chancellor.\n\nJessica Elgot, chief political correspondent: This is the most likely level of support Truss is prepared to offer, citing the cost of the package from Sunak announced earlier this year and with the need to fund her promised tax cuts. She has called it \u201cGordon Brown economics\u201d to have a high tax burden and then high amounts of state help. But such a route would mean starting her premiership with tax cuts that benefit the wealthy and some additional aid for the poorest \u2013 meaning the majority of working people get very little. MPs are worried that is not a sound electoral strategy.\n\nRichard Partington, economics correspondent: Charities are calling for the existing \u00a31,200 energy support payment for 8 million households on means-tested benefits to be doubled. There is a strong economic case for such targeted support because poor families spend more of their budget on essentials \u2013 such as energy and food \u2013 than richer households, leaving them the most exposed to the inflation shock. The Resolution Foundation estimates a \u201ccost of living\u201d inflation rate for the poorest of 1.5 percentage points higher than for the richest.\n\nDouble the fuel discount from \u00a3400 to \u00a3800\n\nSunak announced earlier this year that eligible UK households would receive a \u00a3400 discount to help with energy bills from October. Officials have been looking at the potential for people to receive additional support, perhaps up to \u00a3800, because forecasts for price rises are now considerably higher.\n\nThe discount is easier to administer but somewhat of a blunt instrument because more well-off households will benefit from the discount.\n\nJessica Elgot: This looks more like the kind of package Sunak would back but Truss has said that she favours giving targeted support rather than increasing the \u00a3400 grant for every household, and her allies including the chief secretary to the Treasury, Simon Clarke, have been disparaging about the entire \u00a3400 scheme \u2013 though have said they would not cancel it.\n\nRichard Partington: The case against universal support is that many wealthier households saved money during the pandemic while working from home, with the Bank of England estimating about \u00a3180bn of \u201cexcess savings\u201d. With inflation the result of demand outstripping supply, some economists say putting more money in the pockets of those who can afford to keep spending will pour fuel on the inflationary fire. However, others say the scale of the energy shock requires more people than usual to receive support.\n\nScrapping VAT on energy bills\n\nThis measure, which was first proposed by Labour, is another option being worked on to reduce bills. VAT on domestic energy is charged at a rate of 5% and it would save a typical consumer \u00a3154 over the year, and cost the exchequer about \u00a34.3bn initially. Removing VAT would help those who face the biggest rise in their energy bills \u2013 those who consume the most.\n\nJessica Elgot: Sunak rejected this as chancellor but has made it a key part of his policy offer as a Conservative leadership candidate. This was widely pilloried by the Truss campaign as a screeching U-turn, making it difficult for her to adopt it in No 10 without losing face. But it has the advantage of enabling a new PM to talk up the measure as a \u201cBrexit freedom\u201d.\n\nRichard Partington: One consequence of higher energy bills is that the Treasury will rake in more than expected from the VAT charged on them. Giving some of this back to struggling families therefore makes sense. However, Sunak had previously worried that it would be difficult to put the tax back on again in future, which could cause trouble for the government\u2019s budget deficit amid weaker economic growth and rising spending pressures.\n\nSign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Start the day with the top stories from the US, plus the day\u2019s must-reads from across the Guardian Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA\n\nA new windfall tax\n\nNadhim Zahawi as chancellor has been candid with energy firms about the option for an expansion of the windfall tax on oil and gas companies announced by Sunak in May. Truss has said she is opposed to windfall taxes though Sunak has not ruled it out if he wins \u2013 though that seems unlikely.\n\nExtending the levy could raise \u00a34bn, providing some much needed leeway for the government to help with energy bills. Labour has said the existing windfall tax could be tightened to remove the option for energy firms to claim tax relief on more than 90% of the levy if the money is reinvested.\n\nJessica Elgot: There were raised eyebrows in both leadership camps when Zahawi started talking up the potential for a windfall tax. Truss and her likely future chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, are staunchly opposed to the tax, believing it makes Britain an unpredictable place for investment. Truss has also said profit is \u201cnot a dirty word\u201d. But there is mass public anger about extraordinary profits, which Zahawi has alluded to, so it may be an unpopular stance to defend them.\n\nRichard Partington: Continued high energy prices have helped the world\u2019s five biggest oil companies to bumper profits of nearly \u00a350bn, lining shareholders\u2019 pockets at the expense of consumers. This shows a clear case for a bigger windfall tax. However, chopping and changing the plan could undermine the argument that the policy is a one-off, potentially leading firms to reassess their investment plans.\n\nScrapping the price rise and absorbing the costs\n\nThis is the plan that is gaining momentum, backed by Labour and the Lib Dems, so it would be unusual if the Treasury was not beginning some preliminary work on the possibility. It would involve freezing the energy price cap at its current level of just under \u00a32,000 a year rather than allowing it to rise in line with global wholesale gas prices.\n\nLabour says the plan would cost just under \u00a330bn, although that\u2019s on the assumption that it would apply only for the next six months \u2013 so it may cost much more in the long term.\n\nJessica Elgot: Both candidates have ruled this out, despite overwhelming public support for the measure, which is backed by 85% of Tory voters. However, given past experience of the Tories dismissing and then adopting popular cost of living policies, it is not impossible this one could seem appealing in the cold light of day in September.\n\nRichard Partington: There are clear pros and cons. A universal cap could halt headline inflation from rising further, potentially saving the government money on inflation-linked borrowing. However, it would have a hefty price tag and need to be in place for a year (inflation is based on the 12-month change in consumer prices). Free-market economists argue it would destroy price signals; incentivising energy use, rather than lower consumption and investment in insulation. It would also benefit rich and poor alike.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\n\n\nDeficit fund for suppliers to cover fuel price rise\n\nThe idea has been suggested by the boss of ScottishPower that the government could set up a deficit fund to cover the difference between what people pay and how much it costs to supply their homes with gas and electricity.\n\nThe fund could be underwritten by the government, or a willing financial institution, and repaid over a 10 to 15 year period to smooth out the costs. Suppliers would be expected to use the period the scheme was in place to focus on investments in green energy while policymakers delink electricity prices from gas.\n\nJessica Elgot: This could be a way for Truss to U-turn on freezing prices while claiming it is a way to boost investment and get better value for taxpayers\u2019 money. But it would still require vast sums which she has said she is not prepared to spend \u2013 and that would be on top of additional billions of spending commitment she has made on tax cuts and defence.\n\nRichard Partington: Spreading energy bills over a longer time frame would ease some of the pain today, helping the economic outlook in the short-term. However, it would build up costs for the future, and would ultimately be a cost ultimately borne by consumers rather than the state. If prices stay high, it would mean higher bills for households in future. However, it could help smooth the transition, rather than having cliff-edge moments each time the Ofgem price cap is updated.", "summary": "Boris Johnson has said he will not introduce any new measures to deal with the cost of living crisis.\nRichard Partington: One consequence of higher energy bills is that the Treasury will rake in more than expected from the VAT charged on them.\nExtending the levy could raise \u00a34bn, providing some much needed leeway for the government to help with energy bills.\nJessica Elgot: There were raised eyebrows in both leadership camps when Zahawi started talking up the potential for a windfall tax.\nRichard Partington: Spreading energy bills over a longer time frame would ease some of the pain today, helping the economic outlook in the short-term."},

In a research note dated Sunday, the U.S. banking giant updated its forecasts for the consumer price index and retail price index to 18% and 21%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2023. This is based on the assumption of a \u00a3300 policy offset applied to household energy bills from October through to 2024. Energy regulator Ofgem will this week announce the scale of the next price cap increase from Oct. 1, and Citi expects a rise to \u00a33,717 per year ($4,389) from the current \u00a31,971 for an average household. The price cap essentially limits the amount a supplier can charge for their tariffs, but this limit has surged higher recently due to the rise in wholesale prices \u2014 meaning Brits have seen bills skyrocket. Market research firm Cornwall Insight recently predicted that the cap would rise to \u00a34,266 in January, while consultancy firm Auxilione forecast last week that it would exceed \u00a36,000 by the spring. Benjamin Nabarro, senior associate in the global strategy and macro group at Citi, said guidance on future increases would be the most notable aspect of this week's announcement.\n\n\"We expect further increases to \u00a34,567 in January and then \u00a35,816 in April. The risks here remain skewed to the upside,\" Nabarro said. The key question now is how government policy might impact both inflation and the real economy after a new prime minister takes office on Sept. 5. Comments so far from Conservative leadership favorite Liz Truss point to only a \"limited offset\" for headline inflation, he suggested. \"We already account for a \u00a3300 reduction in bills associated with the suspension of the Green Levy and a cut to VAT on household energy bills,\" Nabarro said. \"However, in reality any government response to this is likely to involve substantially more fiscal firepower (around \u00a340bn in our view). Offsetting the energy increase in full would cost around \u00a330bn for the coming six months (1.4% GDP).\"\n\nThe issue for inflation, he added, is that any fiscal space deployed is likely to be squeezed between weaker medium-term forecasts and the new government's desire to cut taxes, meaning disinflationary measures are \"likely somewhat further down the pecking order.\" The Bank of England earlier this month hiked interest rates by 50 basis points, its largest single increase since 1995, and projected the U.K.'s longest recession since the global financial crisis. It also forecast that inflation would peak at 13.3% in October. Citi now expects a further 125 basis points of monetary tightening at the coming three meetings of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee. U.K. inflation hit 10.1% annually in July and is increasingly expected to exceed the MPC's latest projections.", "summary": "Jim Dyson | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesLONDON \u2014 U.K. inflation is on course to exceed 18% in January as the country's energy price cap enters the stratosphere, Citi economists are projecting.\nThis is based on the assumption of a \u00a3300 policy offset applied to household energy bills from October through to 2024.\n\"We already account for a \u00a3300 reduction in bills associated with the suspension of the Green Levy and a cut to VAT on household energy bills,\" Nabarro said.\nCiti now expects a further 125 basis points of monetary tightening at the coming three meetings of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee.\nU.K. inflation hit 10.1% annually in July and is increasingly expected to exceed the MPC's latest projections."},

Real-time market rent trackers that reported prices shooting up in Sun Belt cities last year are now showing bigger increases in places like New York, San Jose and Seattle.\n\nInflation F.A.Q. Card 1 of 5 Inflation F.A.Q. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. Inflation F.A.Q. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Inflation F.A.Q. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. Inflation F.A.Q. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Inflation F.A.Q. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose market rent increases take time to trickle into official inflation figures because of the way the government calculates its data. Much as Phoenix\u2019s official inflation numbers are surging now partly because of the run-up in market rents in 2021, nascent increases in big coastal cities could keep pressure on inflation in months to come. And the effect could be palpable at a national level: New York and its suburbs account for about 11 percent of the nation\u2019s rental housing-related costs in the Consumer Price Index, compared to about 1 percent for Phoenix.\n\n\u201cEven if we get a slowdown in the Sun Belt, it may not be enough to offset what we\u2019re seeing in other markets,\u201d said Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights.\n\nFederal Reserve officials noted that risk at their July meeting, according to minutes released Wednesday, observing that \u201cin some product categories, the rate of price increase could well pick up further in the short run, with sizable additional increases in residential rental expenses being especially likely.\u201d\n\nThe Fed has been raising interest rates since March to try to slow consumer and business demand and cool inflation and is expected to lift them again at its meeting in September.\n\nTo date, much of the regional divide in price increases \u2014 from rents to consumer goods and services \u2014 has traced back to migration. People have been flocking to less expensive cities from big coastal ones for years, but that trend accelerated sharply with the onset of the pandemic.

Why? | Larry Elliott", "author": ["Larry Elliott"], "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/21/uk-shoppers-are-keeping-calm-and-carrying-on-why", "content": "The UK economy is a puzzle. Inflation has burst above 10% for the first time since Argentina was gearing up to invade the Falklands in early 1982. Prices are rising far more quickly than wages. Consumer confidence has plumbed depths not seen during any of the many misfortunes of the past half century.\n\nAnd yet, the official data shows the British public is carrying on shopping regardless. Retail sales were higher in July than they were in June despite the progressively tighter squeeze on living standards. Airports are busy with holidaymakers, house prices keep on rising. Odd sort of crisis, you might think.\n\nOne possibility is that the gloom surrounding the economy has been overdone. Unemployment is low and job vacancies are high. People are not fearful of losing their jobs and if they are laid off they can hope to find another one relatively quickly.\n\nDemand for foreign holidays is strong because many households built up savings during the pandemic when spending opportunities were restricted. Those cash buffers are now being drawn down, bridging the cost of living gap left by rising inflation.\n\nYes, the Bank of England has raised interest rates at the last six meetings of its monetary policy committee, but in real terms \u2013 adjusted for inflation \u2013 borrowing costs are still low. Put together all these factors and there is a case for saying the UK will experience a relatively mild downturn this winter.\n\nEven the dire state of consumer confidence can be explained away, because a breakdown of the latest snapshot of sentiment shows people are much gloomier about the state of the economy than they are about their personal finances. The wall-to-wall negative reports about a looming cost of living crisis has been registered but, so far at least, households think they are managing.\n\nIt is curious, to say the least, that confidence as measured by GfK is reported to be lower than it was during the three-day week of early 1974, the deep manufacturing recession of the early 1980s and the period in 2008 when it looked as if the banking system would collapse. That may reflect the ubiquitous nature of modern media, and particularly social media, rather than objective economic conditions.\n\nThat is the upbeat view. There is an alternative, with consumers in denial about the horrors to come and having a last splurge of spending before they tighten their belts during autumn\u2019s perfect storm.\n\nThe gloomy view of the economy goes something like this. Growth has pretty much ground to a standstill in the first six months of 2022, with output rising a bit in the first quarter and falling marginally in the second quarter. The labour market has reached a turning point: employment growth is stalling and the number of job vacancies is coming down.\n\nFor now, this is a relatively slow process and many businesses are able to pay more than they would like to attract and retain staff. For the moment, they feel they can pass on the cost of higher wages to their customers by raising prices. The pickup in retail sales growth will do little to discourage them from doing so. This will feed through into core inflation \u2013 the cost of living excluding food, fuel, alcohol and tobacco \u2013 which is closely watched by the Bank of England and which rose above 6% last month.\n\nA double-digit inflation rate and signs that consumer demand is holding up make it more likely the Bank will raise rates by 0.5 percentage points next month, after a similar increase in August.\n\nThis will add to the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses just as higher domestic fuel prices bite. October\u2019s increase in the energy price cap will push up the annual inflation rate still further, intensifying the squeeze on real incomes and massively adding to the fixed costs for millions of businesses.\n\nThere has been plenty of attention paid to what the successor to Boris Johnson will do to alleviate the pain about to be inflicted on households, but less focus on what they ought to be doing to help businesses. In the short term, restaurants, hotels and high street shops will try to pass on their higher costs but they will be less able to do so as consumer demand weakens in the autumn than they have been in the summer. Many will throw in the towel.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\n\n\nIndustrial unrest will provide another dimension. Figures from the Office for National Statistics last week showed total annual pay growth in the private sector running at 5.9% and 1.8% for the public sector.\n\nWith inflation running at 10.1%, that represents a cut in living standards of more than 4% in the private sector and more than 8% in the much more heavily unionised public sector. Inevitably, there will be more strikes as workers \u2013 who can justifiably say they are not responsible for the cost of living crisis \u2013 seek to prevent themselves from getting even poorer.\n\nThe Bank of England leans towards the gloomier of these two scenarios, which is why it is forecasting a protracted recession for the UK in which unemployment rises by more than a million. Threadneedle Street thinks the good news (such as strong retail sales) is unlikely to persist, and that looks like a reasonable call.\n\nWhile that won\u2019t stop the Bank from continuing to raise interest rates in the short-term, by this time next year the monetary policy committee will be under pressure to cut them.

Eccles Federal Reserve Building, photographed on Wednesday, July 27, 2022 in Washington, DC. Kent Nishimura | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Reserve's path to bringing down runaway inflation while keeping the economy from slipping into a major downturn is still open but is getting narrower, according to Goldman Sachs. As the central bank looks to keep raising interest rates, the economy is teeming with mixed signals: rapidly rising payroll figures against sharply declining housing numbers, falling gasoline prices vs. surging shelter and food costs, and low consumer sentiment against steady spending numbers. Amid it all, the Fed is trying to strike a balance between slowing things down, but not by too much. On that score, Goldman economists think there have been clear wins, some losses and a landscape ahead that poses substantial challenges. \"Our broad conclusion is that there is a feasible but difficult path to a soft landing, though several factors beyond the Fed's control can ease or complicate that path and raise or lower the odds of success,\" Goldman economist David Mericle said in a client note Sunday.\n\nSlow growth, high inflation\n\nOne of the biggest inflation drivers has been outsized growth that has created imbalances between supply and demand. The Fed is using interest rate increases to try to damp down demand so supply can catch up, and supply chain pressures, as measured by a New York Fed index, are at their lowest since January 2021. So on that score, Mericle said the Fed's efforts have \"gone well.\" He said the rate increases \u2014 totaling 2.25 percentage points since March \u2014 have \"achieved a much-need deceleration\" regarding growth and specifically demand. In fact, Goldman expects GDP to grow at just a 1% pace over the next four quarters, and that's coming off consecutive declines of 1.6% and 0.9%. Though most economists expect that the National Bureau of Economic Research will not declare the U.S. in recession for the first half of the year, the slow-growth path makes the Fed's balancing act more difficult. On a similar count, Mericle said the Fed's moves have helped narrow the supply-demand gap in the labor market, where there are still nearly two job openings for every available worker. That effort \"has a long way to go,\" he wrote. However, the biggest problem remains stubbornly high inflation. The consumer price index was flat in July but still rose 8.5% from a year ago. Wages are surging at a strong clip, with average hourly earnings up 5.2% from a year ago. Consequently, the Fed's efforts to halt a spiral in which higher prices feed higher wages and perpetuate inflation have \"shown little convincing progress so far,\" Mericle said. \"The bad news is that high inflation is broad-based, measures of the underlying trend are elevated, and business inflation expectations and pricing intentions remain high,\" he added.\n\nDoubts about the Fed's policy path\n\nFighting inflation might require higher rate hikes than the market currently anticipates. Goldman's projection is that the Fed raises benchmark rates by another percentage point before the end of the year, but Mericle acknowledged that there is \"upside risk\" due to \"the recent easing in financial conditions, the robust pace of hiring, and signs of stickiness in wage growth and inflation.\" Indeed, former New York Fed President William Dudley said Monday he thinks the market is underestimating the future path of rate hikes and, consequently, the risks of a hard landing or recession.\n\n\"The market is misunderstanding what the Fed is up to,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in a live interview. \"I think the Fed is going to be higher for longer than what market participants understand at this point.\" In Dudley's view, the Fed will keep hiking until it is sure inflation is heading back to the central bank's 2% target. Even by the most generous inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price index that the Fed follows, inflation is still running at 4.8%. \"The labor market is much tighter than the Fed wants. The wage inflation rate is too high, not consistent with 2% inflation,\" he added. Dudley expects the rates to keep going up until the employment dynamic has shifted enough to get the unemployment rate \"well above 4%,\" compared to its current level of 3.5%.", "summary": "Slow growth, high inflationOne of the biggest inflation drivers has been outsized growth that has created imbalances between supply and demand.\nHowever, the biggest problem remains stubbornly high inflation.\n\"The bad news is that high inflation is broad-based, measures of the underlying trend are elevated, and business inflation expectations and pricing intentions remain high,\" he added.\nEven by the most generous inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price index that the Fed follows, inflation is still running at 4.8%.\nThe wage inflation rate is too high, not consistent with 2% inflation,\" he added."},

The party can no longer take these voters for granted, especially those of working age.

As the country\u2019s economic position worsens in the autumn, many of these voters will be looking for the government to intervene. Tax cuts will be low on the agenda for most voters, and if expectations about tackling regional inequalities end in disappointment, there is a risk that many of the people who lent their vote to the Tories in 2019 will return to Labour at the next election.

When Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979, the top rate of income tax was 83%. In his first budget Sir Geoffrey Howe reduced it to 60%, and the basic rate from 33% to 30%. They decided it would look bad to lower the top rate alone, even though it was absurdly high. But to balance the books they were forced to raise VAT. They had committed themselves not to double VAT \u2013 in those days campaign commitments were serious \u2013 so they raised it from 8% to 15%.\n\nIn his budget of 1988, my old friend Nigel Lawson brought the top rate down to 40% and the basic to 25%. These days the basic rate is 20% and the higher rate remains at Lawson\u2019s level, except for the additional rate on incomes above \u00a3150,000, which is 45%.

CNBC\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway on Friday received regulatory approval to purchase up to 50% of oil giant Occidental Petroleum. Shares of Occidental jumped 10% on the news to close at $71.29 apiece, pushing their 2022 gains to more than 145%. On July 11, Berkshire filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to buy more of the oil company's common stock in secondary market transactions. The conglomerate argued that a maximum 50% stake wouldn't hurt competition or diminish regulatory authority. Carlos Clay, acting director of division of electric power regulation, granted the permission Friday, saying authorization was \"consistent with the public interest.\" The conglomerate has already increased its Occidental stake drastically this year. Berkshire currently owns 188.5 million shares of Occidental, equal to a 20.2% position. It surpassed a key threshold where Berkshire could record some of the oil company's earnings with its own, potentially adding billions of dollars in profit.\n\nBerkshire also owns $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock, and has warrants to buy another 83.9 million common shares for $5 billion, or $59.62 each. The warrants were obtained as part of the company's 2019 deal that helped finance Occidental's purchase of Anadarko. The stake would rise to nearly 27% if Berkshire exercises those warrants. Acquiring the whole company? Friday's news fueled speculation that Buffett will be interested in acquiring the whole company eventually after ramping up his stake at low prices. \"He will likely continue to buy as much as he can get below $70 or $75.

Andrew Kelly | Reuters\n\nIf inflation has been the biggest threat to U.S. economic growth, then July's data should provide signs that there's at least some relief in the pipeline. Prices were flat for the month as gauged by the items that the Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks for its consumer price index. That marked the first time the aggregate measure hadn't posted a month-over-month increase since May 2020, when the widely followed index showed a modest decline. Just a month ago, CPI posted its fastest 12-month gain since November 1982, following a trend that helped send economic growth into contraction for the first half of the year, stirring up talk of a recession. But with at least the short-term trend indicating the rate of price increases is abating, economic optimism is perking up.\n\nNo recession, for now\n\n\"The whole recession narrative really needs to be put on a shelf for now,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies. \"I think it's going to be shifting to a stronger-for-longer narrative, which is really supported by a reversal in inflation.\" Markowska, whose forecasts this year have been accurate, sees solid growth in the near term, including a 3% growth rate in the third quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow gauge, which tracks economic data in real time, pointed to a 2.5% growth rate in a Wednesday update, up 1.1 percentage points from its last one on Aug. 4. However, Markowska also expects pressures to intensify in 2023, with a recession likely in the back part of the year. Indeed, there was a little bit for both arguments in the CPI report. Most of the tempering in inflation came because of a fall in energy prices. Gasoline slid 7.7%, the biggest monthly decline since April 2020. Fuel oil tumbled 11% as energy-related commodity prices were off 7.6%.\n\nTransportation services cost increases also came off the boil, with airline fares tumbling 7.8% to reverse a trend that has seen tickets surge 27.7% over the past year. But there were few other signs of inflation declines in the report, with food costs particularly high. The food index, in fact, rose 1.1% on the month, and its 10.9% pace over the past 12 months is the highest since May 1979. That's causing worries at places such as City Harvest, which helps feed needy New Yorkers who have been hit especially hard by price surge that began last year. \"We're seeing many more children come into food pantries,\" said Jilly Stephens, the organization's CEO. \"Food insecurity had been intractable even before the pandemic hit. Now we're seeing even more people turn to food pantries because of the rising prices.\" Stephens said the number of children seeking food assistance about doubled a year after the Covid pandemic hit, and the organization is struggling to keep up. \"We're always optimistic, because we are supported by incredibly generous New Yorkers,\" she said.\n\nPeople keep spending\n\nDespite the surging prices, consumers have been resilient, continuing to spend even with inflation-adjusted wages contracting 3% over the past year. Jonathan Silver, CEO of Affinity Solutions, which tracks consumer behavior through credit and debit card transactions, said spending is at a healthy pace, rising about 10.5% over the past year, though inflation is influencing behavior. \"When you start to look at specific categories, there's been a lot of shifting in spending, and as a result, some categories are being impacted more than others by inflation,\" he said. \"People are delaying their spending on discretionary items.\" For instance, he said department store spending has fallen 2.4% over the past year, while discount store spending has risen 17%. Amusement park spending is down 18%, but movie theaters are up 92%. Some of those numbers are influenced by rising prices, but they generally reflect the level of transactions as well. As inflation eases, Silver expects discretionary spending to increase. \"We believe there will be a spike later in the year that will create an upward slope to the spending in key categories where the consumer has been delaying and deferring spending,\" he said. \"Consumers may get a holiday present of some relief on food prices.\"", "summary": "A shopping cart is seen in a supermarket as inflation affected consumer prices in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., June 10, 2022.\nAndrew Kelly | ReutersIf inflation has been the biggest threat to U.S. economic growth, then July's data should provide signs that there's at least some relief in the pipeline.\n\"I think it's going to be shifting to a stronger-for-longer narrative, which is really supported by a reversal in inflation.\"\nHowever, Markowska also expects pressures to intensify in 2023, with a recession likely in the back part of the year.\n\"Consumers may get a holiday present of some relief on food prices.\""},

The Yellow river and the Yangtze river will not flow backward,\u201d Li said, striking an upbeat tone while visiting Yantian Port, a gateway to Europe and North America, two of China\u2019s biggest markets.\n\n\u201cThe waters of Yantian Port will also flow incessantly, and not only will continue to maintain your advantages, but also expand your advantages,\u201d Li added. Yet last year, the traffic was far from incessant: Covid rules shut the port, delaying deliveries over Christmas. This spring, similar restrictions forced vessels to queue to enter.\n\nSince the start of this year, China\u2019s insistence on a zero-Covid policy has caused much inconvenience and uncertainty for its people and the struggling economy, prompting grave concerns inside the country about what comes next.\n\n\u201cThe property sector is ailing, investments are all falling, and people are saving rather than spending,\u201d says Hong Hao, a prominent market analyst whose social media account was censored this year after downbeat remarks about the economic outlook.\n\nHong highlights three big headaches for Beijing policymakers: Covid, property and troubling relations with major western countries. \u201cBut there are obstacles all over the place really, and it\u2019s hard to discern which one is the biggest.\u201d\n\nThese stumbling blocks will almost certainly lead to China missing its own economic growth target of \u201caround 5.5%\u201d this year, which Li set in March. In another worrying development, the July unemployment rate among 16- to 24-year-olds reached a record 19.9%, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nSo much so, a recent politburo meeting chaired by the president, Xi Jinping, omitted any mention of a GDP goal, instead suggesting the country should \u201cstabilise employment and prices, maintain economic operations within a reasonable range, and strive to achieve the best possible results\u201d.\n\nThe worries expressed inside China are palpable, though there is also consensus that if its growth model does not reform, the economy will soon run out of the steam. But any change \u2013 for example through Beijing\u2019s tough policies for the property sector announced in 2020 \u2013 would result in major disruption, at least in the short-to-near term. In other words, Beijing is facing a real policy dilemma.\n\n\u201cThe two fundamental problems for China are a natural growth slowdown and improving its regulatory environment,\u201d says Nancy Qian, an economics professor at Northwestern University in Chicago. \u201cBoth are standard growing pains as the economy grows from a low-income to a higher-middle-income one.\u201d\n\nQian says China\u2019s growth is slowing and will plateau because it has reached limits set by its fundamentals. \u201cOne cannot reduce unemployment without creating new jobs. But how can there be new jobs if existing firms don\u2019t make more money? And many firms, like the real-estate firms and construction industry in trouble today, have been doing much worse than we thought.\u201d\n\nThe bad economic performance may be unavoidable, but it has real social \u2013 and potentially political \u2013 consequences. This is particularly the case for a system without the safety valve of elections.\n\nLast month, it emerged that hundreds of homebuyers across the country were huddling together to refuse payments on mortgages on homes left unfinished by developers. On social media, angry buyers discussed ways to attract the government\u2019s attention in order to put pressure on \u201cgreedy and dishonest developers\u201d.\n\nSensing a social crisis in the making, Beijing quickly came up with measures to smooth out the tensions and aid the property sector \u2013 which accounts for 25% of the Chinese economy. Some local officials produced novel ideas, such as encouraging party members to lead the buying spree.\n\n\u201cI hope that today all comrades will take the lead in buying property,\u201d Deng Bibo, a county party secretary in Hunan province, urged in a viral video this week. \u201cBuy one property, then buy a second one. If you purchased a second one already, then buy a third. Bought a third? Then buy your fourth.\u201d\n\nDeng Bibo, a county party secretary of China\u2019s Hunan province, encouraged everyone to buy several homes during his opening speech for a real estate exhibition fair in Shimen, a county of Hunan.\n\nQian says the real-estate crisis is one example of the difficulty of maturing the regulatory system for a rapidly growing economy. Chinese watchdogs and policymakers have known for a while that huge property firms such as Evergrande were borrowing a lot. It worked as long as the economy was growing. But at some point the music stops.\n\nNow China is stuck in a vicious circle. \u201cThe faster the slowdown, the bigger the problem,\u201d says Qian. \u201cThe less trust consumers have in the economy, the less willing they are to keep paying for incomplete housing, and the bigger the problem. The faster the slowdown, the less trust consumers have.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s domestic trouble also has an international dimension. What was once \u201cthe world\u2019s factory\u201d is now entangled in geopolitical battles with many western markets. Last month, Tony Danker, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said UK companies were already rethinking their operations in anticipation of the UK\u2019s decoupling with China.\n\nBut, perhaps the biggest elephant in the room in China\u2019s economy today is politics, analysts say. In one of Li\u2019s videos during his Shenzhen tour, he was heard likening reforming and opening China to \u201cblazing a trail of blood\u201d. But soon after it was uploaded to Chinese social media, users began to report they were no longer able to view it.\n\n\u201cAfter users\u2019 complaints and following the platform\u2019s examination, this video touched on political and current affairs content that was not qualified to publish,\u201d the error message read.", "summary": "\u201cBoth are standard growing pains as the economy grows from a low-income to a higher-middle-income one.\u201dQian says China\u2019s growth is slowing and will plateau because it has reached limits set by its fundamentals.\n\u201cBuy one property, then buy a second one.\nQian says the real-estate crisis is one example of the difficulty of maturing the regulatory system for a rapidly growing economy.\nChinese watchdogs and policymakers have known for a while that huge property firms such as Evergrande were borrowing a lot.\nBut, perhaps the biggest elephant in the room in China\u2019s economy today is politics, analysts say."},

The red lights of recession are flashing.\n\nThe eurozone\u2019s big four economies \u2013 Germany, France, Italy and Spain \u2013 have all had their growth forecasts for 2023 downgraded by the International Monetary Fund, as a combination of the war and higher interest rates put a brake on activity.\n\nIn the UK, inflation is above 10% for the first time in 40 years as households struggle with rising energy bills. The Bank of England forecasts inflation will peak above 13% in autumn after a fresh increase in energy costs, while the economy will fall into a lengthy recession.\n\nWhile Britain is contending with additional pressures from Brexit, the impact of soaring energy prices, supply chain disruption, shortages of workers and drought are also hitting the rest of Europe. Analysts at the Economist Intelligence Unit say the pain could go on for some time, because countries must wean themselves off Russian hydrocarbons, and building up renewables as an alternative will take time.\n\n\u201cIn the near term we expect a recession in Europe in the winter of 2022-23 as a result of energy shortages and sustained elevated inflation\u201d, the EIU said. \u201cThe winter of 2023-24 will also be challenging, and so we expect high inflation and sluggish growth until at least 2024.\u201d\n\nHere we assess the chances of recession in the EU \u2013 and Russia.\n\nGermany\n\nEurope\u2019s largest economy is in the centre of the storm, as the energy crisis, months without rainfall, and a breakdown in global trade batter its manufacturing base. Economic growth slowed to stall speed in the second quarter and is likely to turn negative in the coming months.\n\n\u201cIt will need an economic miracle for Germany not to fall into recession in the second half of the year,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski of the Dutch bank ING. \u201cThe fact that the entire German economic business model is currently up for renovation will also weigh on growth prospects in the coming years.\u201d\n\nRussia supplied more than half of Germany\u2019s gas in 2020 and about a third of all oil. Since the outbreak of war, the Kremlin has throttled supplies, blaming technical problems for a fall in volume through the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline.\n\nDrought and scorching temperatures have caused a sharp fall in water levels on the Rhine, a key transport route for Germany\u2019s dominant industrial sector. Water levels have fallen below the critical 40cm mark, preventing barges from being loaded to full capacity. Some routes have been cancelled, causing delays for chemicals firms and other manufacturers in industrial heartlands. Factories along the shores of the Rhine dependent on water for cooling have also faced problems, while coal shipments to power plants \u2013 which had been earmarked for keeping the lights on \u2013 are likely to be disrupted.\n\nIn response to the energy crisis, Berlin will impose a gas levy for households, due to come into effect from October and lasting until April 2024, which is designed to spread the higher wholesale cost between households and industry.\n\nThe government has put in place an energy support package worth more than \u20ac30bn (\u00a326bn), including a \u20ac300 lump sum for workers, extra support for those on welfare, cuts to petrol and diesel taxes and discounted \u20ac9 bus and train tickets.\n\nThe German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has also promised a fresh package of financial support.\n\nChances of recession (out of five)\n\nFrance\n\nFrance should be better insulated than many other European nations, thanks to its large nuclear energy sector, which accounts for just over 70% of its electricity generation, but it has been struggling with serious faults at ageing reactors. Although in a less parlous position than Germany, the eurozone\u2019s second-biggest economy could still face damaging power cuts this winter.\n\nGDP rose in France by 0.5% in the second quarter, lower than in other nations across the continent, with domestic consumption notably weak. The government has put in place an emergency support package worth \u20ac20bn, including tax cuts at petrol pumps, while capping an increase in regulated electricity prices at 4%, a policy helped by state ownership of the energy giant EDF.\n\nChances of recession\n\nItaly\n\nThe Italian economy has performed much more strongly recently than its big eurozone rivals, notching up growth of 1% in the second quarter. But like Germany, Italy is heavily dependent on Russian gas and has the added complication of being thrown into a fresh bout of political uncertainty after the resignation of Mario Draghi as prime minister earlier this summer.\n\nOpinion polls point to a change of direction from Draghi\u2019s technocratic approach following forthcoming elections. A rightwing coalition government that has been campaigning on a strongly nationalistic and protectionist economic platform is expected to win.\n\nFinancial markets and the European Central Bank are already alive to the risks of investors demanding a higher interest-rate premium for buying Italian bonds. With Italy firmly in mind, the ECB announced a new financial instrument last month designed to prevent higher interest rates from having a disproportionately adverse impact on more vulnerable member states.\n\nIn early August, Italy approved a new aid package worth about \u20ac17bn for consumers and businesses, in one of Draghi\u2019s final acts as leader. A tax cut on petrol and diesel, which had been due to expire this month, has also been extended to 20 September.\n\nSince the creation of the single currency almost a quarter of a century ago, Italy has been the weakest performing of the \u201cbig four\u201d, with living standards barely higher than at the end of the 1990s. It is benefiting this year from a boost to tourism, which accounted for 13% of its GDP before the pandemic.\n\nChances of recession\n\nSpain\n\nLike every other country in Europe, Spain is affected by the war in Russia but of the big four it has the best chance of avoiding recession, despite soaring inflation.\n\nThere are a number of reasons for this. Its economy went into the crisis in reasonably good shape and \u2013 like Italy \u2013 has been given an added boost by the surge in tourism after the pandemic. Tourism accounted for 12% of Spain\u2019s GDP before Covid and an even bigger share of employment.\n\nBut Spain is much less reliant on Russian energy than Italy, and is already a big importer of liquefied natural gas from around the world. GDP rose by 1.1% in the second quarter and the IMF expects it to be the fastest growing of the big four next year.\n\nThe government has put in place \u20ac16bn of financial aid and loans to help companies and households with soaring energy costs.\n\nChances of recession\n\nRussia\n\nRussia has suffered under the west\u2019s sanctions, plunging its economy into a deep recession and forcing the Kremlin to default on its foreign debts for the first time since 1918, though soaring energy prices have helped blunt some of the impact.\n\nResearchers from Yale University said last month that the west was crippling the Russian economy, although other experts disagree. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank, said that recent data did not point to such a \u201cstark conclusion\u201d.\n\nA \u2018Stars\u2019 coffee bar in Moscow: Russia is already in recession. Photograph: Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRussia\u2019s current account balance \u2013 measuring trade and investment flows \u2013 more than tripled to hit a record $167bn surplus in the second quarter, helped by high wholesale oil and gas prices swelling exports, while western sanctions led to a fall in imports. The proceeds have been a vital source of hard currency for Moscow, reflected in the rouble erasing losses seen since the start of the invasion.\n\nHowever, over the long run experts say Russia\u2019s economy will struggle with the loss of western technology and investment. \u201cOur best guess is that Russia is in a major but still far from catastrophic recession\u201d, Schmieding added.", "summary": "\u201cIn the near term we expect a recession in Europe in the winter of 2022-23 as a result of energy shortages and sustained elevated inflation\u201d, the EIU said.\nEconomic growth slowed to stall speed in the second quarter and is likely to turn negative in the coming months.\nGDP rose in France by 0.5% in the second quarter, lower than in other nations across the continent, with domestic consumption notably weak.\nGDP rose by 1.1% in the second quarter and the IMF expects it to be the fastest growing of the big four next year.\nResearchers from Yale University said last month that the west was crippling the Russian economy, although other experts disagree."},

Wheat, soybean, sugar, and corn futures have fallen from their March highs back to prices seen at the start of 2022. Olga Maltseva | Afp | Getty Images\n\nFood prices dropped significantly in July from the previous month, particularly the costs of wheat and vegetable oil, according to the latest figures from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. But the FAO said that while the drop in food prices \"from very high levels\" is \"welcome,\" there are doubts over whether the good news will last. \"Many uncertainties remain, including high fertilizer prices that can impact future production prospects and farmers' livelihoods, a bleak global economic outlook, and currency movements, all of which pose serious strains for global food security,\" FAO chief economist Maximo Torero said in a press release. The FAO food price index, which tracks the monthly change in the global prices of a basket of food commodities, fell 8.6% in July from the month before. In June, the index fell just 2.3% month on month. However, the index in July was still 13.1% higher than July 2021.\n\nPrices in the short term may fall further, if futures are anything to go by. Wheat, soybean, sugar, and corn futures have fallen from their March highs back to prices seen at the start of 2022. For example, the wheat contracts closed at $775.75 per bushel on Friday, down from a 12-year high of $1,294 in March, and around the $758 price set in January.\n\nWhy prices fell\n\nAnalysts cited a mix of both demand and supply reasons for the slide in food prices: Ukraine and Russia's closely watched agreement to resume exports of grain through the Black Sea after months of blockade; better-than-expected crop harvests; a global economic slowdown; and the strong U.S. dollar. Rob Vos, the director of markets, trade and institutions at the International Food Policy Research Institute, pointed to the news that the United States and Australia are set to deliver bumper wheat harvests this year, which will improve supply since shipment from Ukraine and Russia have been curtailed. The higher U.S. dollar also lowers the price of staples, since commodities are priced in U.S. dollars, Vos said. Traders tend to ask for lower nominal dollar prices of commodities when the greenback is expensive.\n\nThe widely heralded U.N.-backed deal between Ukraine and Russia also helped to cool the market. Ukraine was the world's sixth-biggest wheat exporter in 2021, accounting for 10% of global wheat market share, according to the United Nations. The first shipment of Ukrainian grain \u2014 26,000 tons of maize \u2014 since the invasion left the country's southwestern port of Odesa last Monday.\n\nSkepticism over Ukraine-Russia deal\n\nGlobal skepticism over whether Russia will keep its end of the bargain hangs in the air. Russia fired a missile onto Odesa just hours after the U.N.-brokered deal in late-July. And freight and insurance companies may still think it's too risky to ship grain out of a war zone, Vos said, adding that food prices remain volatile and any new shock can cause more price surges. \"To make a difference it will not be enough to get a few shipments out, but at least 30 or 40 per month to get the existing grains stored in Ukraine out, as well as the produce of the upcoming harvest,\" said Vos. \"To help stabilize markets, the deal will need to hold in full also during the second half of the year since that is the period where Ukraine does most of its exports.\"\n\nEven with the existing agreement, arable Ukrainian land may continue to be destroyed \"for as long as the war continues,\" which will result in even less crop yield next year, Carlos Mera, the head of agri commodities market research at Rabobank, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Europe\" last week. \"Once this [grain] corridor is over, we might see even more price increases going forward,\" Mera said. Consumers could also see further price increases as there is normally a lag of three to nine months before a movement in commodity prices is reflected on supermarket shelves. Then there is the pressure of exporting enough grain as quickly as possible from a war zone. \"It's time that we're working again. I don't see us exporting two [to] five million tons per month out of these Black Sea ports,\" John Rich, the executive chairman of Ukrainian poultry giant Myronivsky Hliboproduct (MHP), told CNBC's \"Capital Connection\" on Monday. \"Hungry people, at the end of the day, get hungry very quickly after a week.\" In a note published earlier this month, credit rating agency Fitch Ratings' analysts wrote that a possible increase in fertilizer prices, which fell recently \u2014 but which are still double that of 2020 \u2014 could cause grain prices to jump again. Russia's restriction of gas supply has led European natural gas prices to spike. Natural gas is a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers. La Nina weather patterns could disrupt grain harvests later this year as well, they added.\n\nAnd the fall in food prices is not all good news. Part of the reason why staples have become cheaper is that traders and investors are pricing in recessionary fears, the analysts said. The global manufacturing purchasing managers' index has been in decline, while the U.S. Federal Reserve seems bent on raising interest rates to curb inflation even if it triggers a recession, the Fitch team wrote.\n\nFood staples", "summary": "But the FAO said that while the drop in food prices \"from very high levels\" is \"welcome,\" there are doubts over whether the good news will last.\nThe FAO food price index, which tracks the monthly change in the global prices of a basket of food commodities, fell 8.6% in July from the month before.\nIn June, the index fell just 2.3% month on month.\nUkraine was the world's sixth-biggest wheat exporter in 2021, accounting for 10% of global wheat market share, according to the United Nations.\nAnd the fall in food prices is not all good news."},
{"date": ["2022-08-20"], "title": "\u2018I am not blaming anyone\u2019: Estonians shrug off 23% inflation", "author": ["Daniel Boffey"], "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/20/estonia-europe-inflation-hotspot-23-per-cent", "content": "Like his cappuccinos, Taniel Vaaderpass, 33, isn\u2019t bitter. His usually profitable company, OA Coffee, one of Estonia\u2019s biggest coffee bean roasting companies, may have posted a loss for the first time last year and is set to do so again this year, but Vaaderpass remains strikingly sanguine as he sits on the terrace of the cafe he also owns on a cobbled street in the old town of Tallinn.\n\nThe central causes of Vaaderpass\u2019s misfortune is a 240% increase in the price of unroasted green coffee and a 20% surge in the cost of the gas he uses to roast his imported beans. He also felt the need to give his staff a 10% pay rise in January despite the lack of company profits.\n\nThis is the reality of living in Europe\u2019s inflation hotspot. The latest figures, published on Thursday, showed that Estonia has an annual inflation rate of an astounding 23.2% \u2013 the highest in the eurozone, vastly outpacing the average of 8.9%.\n\nVaaderpass is inevitably part of the cycle. He has raised his price to supermarkets by 25% over the last eight months and he fears he will have to do so again this year. A coffee in his cafe is today half a euro more expensive than it was, and Vaaderpass says he will also have to cut costs to get \u201cback on track\u201d.\n\nBut he is not on the streets calling for the government\u2019s downfall. No Estonians are. Indeed the latest polling has the Reform party, the largest party in the ruling coalition, flying high with 34.4% of the vote, and their conservative rivals on 21.3%, six months before the national elections.\n\n\u201cEstonians are not that temperamental,\u201d Vaaderpass says. \u201cCalm northern people. No emotions, you know. The joke is that when Covid hit and people couldn\u2019t meet, it was a lucky day for Estonians. Celebration day.\u201d\n\nA woman picking nectarines at Balti Jaama market in Tallinn. Photograph: Hendrik Osula/The Guardian\n\nPart of the explanation for the lack of a political backlash may be that Estonian salaries have been on a sharp upward trajectory for several years and the economy recovered well and quickly from the Covid pandemic, leading to labour shortages and higher wages. Voters are relatively relaxed about a temporary period of higher prices, it is suggested.\n\nBut there is also an understanding in Estonia, once part of the Soviet Union and containing a large Russian-language minority, that the war in Ukraine is the source of many of their problems, says Kaspar Oja, an economist at Estonia\u2019s central bank.\n\n\u201cIn many countries people have gone to the streets even with lower inflation rates, but here people are quite calm,\u201d he says. \u201cOf course there are people who complain, but most people understand that the increase in energy prices is broadly related to the war and they understand what it is behind it.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, something percolating, he admits.\n\nEstonia\u2019s standout inflation rate is also due to some peculiarities in its economy, and potentially some governmental missteps that may be seized upon. Recent pension reforms have allowed people to dip into their nest eggs to spend now rather than later. A large proportion of consumers are on energy deals that are linked to the market price rather than fixed.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Estonia remains a relatively poor country within the EU, and so energy and food prices make up an oversized part of consumer spending.\n\n\u201cLately there have been more complaints about the electricity because they can see companies have benefited from it,\u201dOja says. \u201cConsumers are paying more but Estonia has energy producers which are benefiting pretty well and people are not happy about that. That is why the government is planning to have a universal electricity service for small consumers, mostly households, to take effect from October. The electricity companies will have to sell electricity according to the production costs.\u201d\n\nIt is also, however, starting to be noticed in the media how little the prime minister, Kaja Kallas, who has spoken of the need to keep tight control over spending, has offered in terms of mitigation on energy prices.\n\nJacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute For International Economics, says the latest inflation figures show that the more interventionist governments, such as the French, with the lowest annual inflation rate in the eurozone at 6.8%, and the Italians (8.4%), have done best in shielding their voters from the inflationary pressures.\n\n\u201cThe underlying issue is that the Estonians haven\u2019t done very much,\u201d Kirkegaard says. \u201cThe French have been largely insulated because of the nuclear production and they haven\u2019t had nearly the same pass through.

Rather than raking in fixed fees, Kraus' $3.8 billion firm operates on a fee structure linked to performance, charging 30 percent of alpha. That's higher than the industry standard but since inception, about half of Aperture's funds have delivered alpha above their benchmarks. Kraus sat down with CNBC's Delivering Alpha newsletter to explain why he's focused on a pay-for-performance set-up and how he's putting capital to work in the current environment.\n\n(The below has been edited for length and clarity. See above for full video.)\n\nLeslie Picker: What do you see as the key problem with the traditional model? And what do you think is the best way to fix it?\n\nPeter Kraus: The key problem is very simple. The existing model in almost all cases, rewards people whether or not they perform. So, it's a fixed fee and as assets grow, you earn more money. Well, clients don't actually hire us to grow our assets, they hire us to perform. So, you would think the performance fee or the actual fee would be connected to the performance as opposed to the asset growth. We also know that asset growth is the enemy of performance. It's harder and harder to perform, the more assets that you manage. So, the fee doesn't help you - that traditional fee doesn't help in that regard, because the manager is incentivized to continue to grow assets, and that makes it harder and harder to perform.\n\nOf course, there are performance fees in the marketplace and hedge funds and private equity, but they also have rather large management fees. So, they too have some incentive to grow their assets. Basically Aperture is the anathema to that - it's the opposite. We charge a very low base fee that's equal to the ETF and then we only charge if we beat the index. So, you pay for performance. If we don't have any performance, you pay what you pay to buy the ETF.\n\nPicker: So, then how do you choose which index is relevant for the specific strategies?. I mean, do you invest in certain ways that would mirror or would be comparable to certain indexes that you're able to then outperform?\n\nKraus: Exactly. So, we're very, very thoughtful about the index because we're actually charging people to beat the index. So, for example, in global equities, we would use the MSCI global equity index. For U.S. small cap, we would use the Russell 2000. For European equities, we would use the Euro Stoxx Index. Very simple indices, not complex, no real question about whether the manager is actually creating a portfolio that is following that index. In fact, we actually test the correlation of the portfolio to the index to make sure the index continues to be relevant.\n\nPicker: People who advocate for their management fee will say that it's necessary, essentially, to keep the lights on - that it basically ensures that the operations of the fund can meet all of their fixed costs and cover their expenses. How are you able to do so with a lower management fee?\n\nKraus: People say, well, I need to keep the lights on. Well, okay, how many assets do you need to keep the lights on? And once you have the lights on, then do you need to keep charging the fixed fee? Because your incentive is just to continue to gather assets. So, it's really a function of how many assets we have and we've created a company where we think that assets scale pretty much speaks for revenues to cover the fixed expenses. And then the rest is only earned if we perform. One of the things that I like about Aperture is that I'm incentivized, as the owner of the business identically with the client. I don't make much money, if any money, unless we actually perform.\n\nPicker: What about your ability to recruit and pay employees? Does it have any bearing on compensation?\n\nKraus: Sure does. The portfolio managers are paid a strict percentage of the performance fee. So, portfolio managers are usually paid 35% of the 30% that we charge. We charge a 30% performance fee and we pay the management, to the portfolio managers and their team, 35% of that. And we've selected that percentage because we think that that is highly competitive with both the hedge fund industry as well as the long-only industry. And if managers perform on the amount of capital that they have, their compensation can be quite attractive. And that's, in effect, how we believe we can attract some of the best talent in the marketplace.\n\nPicker: It doesn't appear though, at least in the current environment, that LPs are too dissuaded by the traditional model. I mean, there were nearly 200 hedge fund launches in Q1 outpacing the number of liquidations. AUM stands around $4 trillion for the hedge fund industry overall. So, it doesn't appear that LPS have really been pushing back, at least in terms of new launches and total AUM size. So, I'm just curious kind of what your conversations have been like on that front?\n\nKraus: Well, there's $4 trillion in the hedge fund community but there's $32 trillion in the long-only community. And I don't think that it's a question that is hard to answer. If you look at the trend between the active management industry and the passive industry, money's been moving to the passive industry at a rapid pace - unchanged for 10 years. And the hedge fund space, the $4 trillion - we're talking about all sorts of different types of hedge funds, for sure, it's not a monolithic industry. But essentially, most managers or most allocators that I speak to would rather not pay a performance fee times the beta that their money is exposed to. They would like to pay a performance fee for actually the performance. And so, we offer that clarity, which many hedge funds do not. And in the long-only space, there's virtually no payment for performance. It's almost all fixed.\n\nPicker: Since there's so much on the line with regard to performance, I have to ask you, what's your strategy? What's your what's your thinking right now? How are you putting capital to work in the current environment in a way that you believe will outperform the benchmarks?\n\nKraus: It depends upon the strategy, whether it's an equity strategy or fixed income strategy. But in the equity strategies, we are what you would expect - highly research dependent, looking for specific opportunities with companies that we think have long term growth, or undervalue and will accelerate their value over time. And that timeframe is usually 18 months to three years. In the credit space, again, it's fundamental research to find credits and obviously being careful about the market because credit markets tend to be more macro driven. But it's all of the above and that's what we spend our time doing. We think that if we do that consistently over time, we can perform.\n\nPicker: Are you net long or net short in the current environment?\n\nKraus: Interestingly enough, in the one hedge fund that we do run, we're pretty close to flat. So, I would say a very low net position. In the other funds that we run, we run 100% long. So, in other words, we are what I call beta one, exposed to the index by 100%. But we do have shorts, so we're gross more than 100% in those funds. But I would say in general, right now, our risk positions are low.\n\nPicker: So, not much leverage then?\n\nKraus: Not much leverage, but more importantly, the actual stocks and bonds that we are choosing and the positions we're taking, we're on, I would say, the low end of our risk scale.", "summary": "And we've selected that percentage because we think that that is highly competitive with both the hedge fund industry as well as the long-only industry.\nI mean, there were nearly 200 hedge fund launches in Q1 outpacing the number of liquidations.\nAUM stands around $4 trillion for the hedge fund industry overall.\nKraus: Well, there's $4 trillion in the hedge fund community but there's $32 trillion in the long-only community.\nKraus: Interestingly enough, in the one hedge fund that we do run, we're pretty close to flat."},

The Post Office research found that 71% of Brits planning to go on holiday in the U.K. this year intend to take out cash before doing so. Of those who have holidayed in the U.K. in the last five years, almost a third admitted to being caught out by not having cash on them. In July, the Post Office processed more than 600,000 cash payouts for people eligible for energy bill support from the British government. That came to around \u00a390 million and allowed people to pay energy bills, top up gas and electricity meters or use cash for easier budgeting.

Photograph: Septemberlegs Editorial/Alamy The UK\u2019s transport department has announced \u00a3130m of funding for England\u2019s bus network to make up for shortfalls in revenues caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The cash will help to cover six months of operations by the private companies who run England\u2019s buses from October 2022 to March 2023, the government said. Bus companies \u2013 like other parts of the UK\u2019s struggling public transport industry \u2013 have been fighting to attract customers back to their routes after passenger numbers slumped during the coronavirus lockdowns. The government gave bus providers their first bailout (worth \u00a3400m) in April 2020 in order to protect routes while passenger numbers were down. Since then the value of funding made available to 160 companies has reached \u00a32bn, the government said on Friday. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary who has had a busy day, said: At a time when people are worried about rising costs, it\u2019s more important than ever we save these bus routes for the millions who rely on them for work, school and shopping. The Confederation of Passenger Transport, a lobby group for the bus and coach industry, perhaps unsurprisingly welcomed the money. A CPT spokesperson said: Today\u2019s announcement will help bus operators and local authority partners to balance a network of reliable and affordable services in the short-term as bus networks adapt to new travel patterns. For the longer-term, we will continue to work closely with central government and local authorities to encourage existing and new passengers to get on board the country\u2019s buses, ensuring they are provided the best possible services.\n\n\n\n4d ago 13.52 John McDonnell MP (centre) joining the picket line outside Euston Station as railway workers stage an earlier 24-hour walk-out on 27 July. Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/REX/Shutterstock Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said the UK government should match public-sector pay increases to inflation. Matching consumer price index inflation of 10.1% annually would imply billions of pounds of extra spending, and many economists including the Bank of England would argue that it would itself feed through into higher inflation. Speaking to BBC Radio 4, he said: I think that\u2019s the only way that we can protect them [households] from sinking into, in some instances, poverty. McDonnell said the roots of the discontent go back 12 years to the global financial crisis, and the austerity policies brought in by the Conservative government in its aftermath. He said: There\u2019s a build-up of a whole range of unions, some of whom have never been on strike before, faced with members saying to them, \u2018We cannot survive with the wages we have at the moment\u2019. We need to inflation-proof our wages. The unions are responding to their members. McDonnell argued that most of the inflationary pressure facing the UK is from external factors, citing the Bank of England. Those pressures are coming from supply chain snarl-ups caused by Covid-19 lockdowns (most notably in China) and the surge in energy prices accelerated by concerns that Russian President Vladimir Putin will cut off gas supplies to Europe as part of his response to his country\u2019s isolation following its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n4d ago 13.28 Transport secretary Grant Shapps has blamed the unions for not putting a pay offer to a vote of members for London\u2019s strikes. The union has the backing of members for the strike action, after receiving 91.1% of votes in favour in a ballot in late June that drew a 53.1% turnout. But Shapps wants the union to put an offered pay rise of 8% over two years to members. That is significantly lower than the 10.1% level of inflation in a single year, and would therefore imply that workers receive a real-terms pay cut. Shapps told the BBC radio: It\u2019s certainly enormously disruptive, particularly in the capital today where the strikes are focused. But look, overall I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to be having these strikes at all. A very fair pay offer has gone on the table on the wider network of 8% over two years. This is no compulsory redundancies in return for modernising work practices that should have gone out with the ark. If only the union bosses would actually put that offer to their members I\u2019m pretty sure this strike would be over.\n\n\n\n4d ago 13.07 Sadiq Khan has been on the media rounds today. He has told BBC London that he believes the current government is \u201canti-London\u201d. This is building on his earlier criticism that the government is using the strikes as an opportunity to provoke unions into industrial action that may be unpopular with some segments of the population. Khan said: Of course I understand their concerns. I\u2019m the person who has been vocal about the concerns that Londoners have, including transport workers, businesses, about some of the conditions the government\u2019s been trying to attach. I think this is an anti-London government. I think they\u2019ve been trying to use this as an opportunity to provoke the trade unions, and I worry that we\u2019re falling into the government\u2019s trap.

The sister of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was speaking at the Global Supertrends Conference 2022 on Wednesday. The Web3 is a hypothetical, future version of the internet based on blockchain technology \u2014 an \"ideal utopia,\" said Zuckerberg. \"But \u2026 that's not what's happening. What's happening in reality, is chaos.\"\n\nThe founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media, a production company and marketing consultancy, added, \"You're the only one watching your own back and your own assets, people are spending time protecting themselves by setting up so many different wallets and protecting their identity and that's not contributing to development in the area.\" Zuckerberg, who was an early employee at Meta \u2014 formerly known as Facebook \u2014 explained that various metaverses are now acting as \"their own walled garden,\" in which users are unable to use their assets across platforms. The metaverse can be loosely defined as a virtual world where people live, work and play.

Pictured here in Guangxi, China, on Aug. 15, 2022, is a real estate complex developed by state-owned conglomerate Poly Group. Future Publishing | Future Publishing | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Chinese property developers' cash flows \u2014 a sign of the companies' ability to stay afloat \u2014 shrank this year after steady growth over the last decade, according to Oxford Economics. Developer cash flows through July are down 24% year-on-year on an annualized basis, according to analysis from the firm's lead economist, Tommy Wu. That's a sharp slowdown from growth for nearly every year since at least 2009, the data showed. Total funding as of July was 15.22 trillion yuan ($2.27 trillion) on an annualized basis, versus 20.11 trillion yuan in 2021. The drop comes as credit demand in China missed expectations in July, and property developers' struggles drag on. About two years ago, Beijing started to crack down on developers' high reliance on debt for growth. Notably, Evergrande defaulted late last year. Other developers like Shimao have also defaulted, despite appearing to have healthier balance sheets.\n\nWhile investors have turned cautious on Chinese property companies, developers now face the risk of losing another important source of cash flow: homebuyer pre-payments.\n\nHomes are typically sold ahead of completion in China. But since late June, some homebuyers have protested apartment construction delays by halting mortgage payments. \"The crux of the problem is that property developers have insufficient cash flows \u2013 whether because of debt-servicing costs, low housing sales, or misuse of funds \u2013 to continue with projects,\" Wu said in a report last week. \"Resolving this problem will rebuild homebuyers' confidence in developers, which will help support housing sales and, in turn, improve developers' financial health.\" More than $2 billion in high-yield property developer debt is due in September \u2014 that's more than two times that of August, according to Morgan Stanley's analysis as of Aug. 10. About a quarter of homebuyers who bought property ahead of their completion are inclined to stop their mortgage payments if construction is suspended, the U.S. investment bank said in an Aug. 15 report, citing a proprietary AlphaWise Consumer Survey. Not only does real estate account for the bulk of household wealth in China, but analysts estimate property and industries related to real estate account for more than a quarter of China's GDP. The real estate slump has contributed to an overall slowdown in economic growth this year.\n\nIn an effort to support growth, the People's Bank of China has cut rates, including an unexpected cut on Monday of 10 basis points to some one-year interest rates for institutions, known as the medium-term lending facility. While the PBOC may hope the cut could ease some of homebuyers' burden and help developers get loans, the problem isn't just about funding, said Bruce Pang, chief economist and head of research for Greater China at JLL. He noted how developers have found it harder to obtain funding on their own, and have had to rely more on pre-sales to homebuyers. But people are increasingly cautious about buying new homes due to their expectations for future employment and returns on existing investment products, he added. Despite multiple reports of government plans to keep developers funded, the central government has yet to officially announce broader support for real estate. A readout of a high-level government meeting last month said local governments are responsible for delivering completed houses. Among three major sources of developer funding, advance payments and deposits have fallen the most this year, down by 34%, according to Wu's analysis. Credit as a source of funding dropped by 22%, while self-raised capital, including stocks and bonds, was down by 17%, the annualized data showed.\n\nInvestors turn away from China property\n\nInvestment funds have largely stayed away from Chinese property developers, reducing a potential source of funding. \"What has been worrying has been the lack of willingness and speed by top policymakers in resolving real estate developer's funding issues,\" Carol Lye, assistant portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, said in an emailed response to CNBC. Lye said the investment management firm's allocation to China real estate is low, and that Brandywine holds \"high quality real estate bonds that have been given preference in terms of government support.\" Some investors have even turned to companies in other parts of Asia. \"We've exited almost all of our holdings in China residential. It's more a wait-and-see game in terms of getting back exposure,\" said Xin Yan Low, Singapore-based portfolio manager for Asia property equities at Janus Henderson. She declined to share a timeframe of those sales. \"There are still many alternatives in the region, especially with reopening now, Singapore, Australia, basically back to full reopening, fundamentals are strong,\" she said.

Olivier Douliery | AFP | Getty Images\n\nYou'd be hard-pressed now to find a recession in the rearview mirror. What's down the road, though, is another story. There is no historical precedent to indicate that an economy in recession can produce 528,000 jobs in a month, as the U.S. did during July. A 3.5% unemployment rate, tied for the lowest since 1969, is not consistent with contraction. But that doesn't mean there isn't a recession ahead, and, ironically enough, it is the labor market's phenomenal resiliency that could pose the broader economy's biggest long-run danger. The Federal Reserve is trying to ease pressures on a historically tight jobs situation and its rapid wage gains in an effort to control inflation running at its highest level in more than 40 years.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is this gives the Fed additional room to continue to tighten, even if it raises the probability of pushing the economy into recession,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \"It's not going to be an easy task to continue to tighten without negative repercussions for the consumer and the economy.\" Indeed, following the robust job numbers, which included a 5.2% 12-month gain for average hourly earnings, traders accelerated their bets on a more aggressive Fed. As of Friday afternoon, markets were assigning about a 69% chance of the central bank enacting its third straight 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike when it meets again in September, according to CME Group data. So while President Joe Biden celebrated the big jobs number on Friday, a much more unpleasant data point could be on the way next week. The consumer price index, the most widely followed inflation measure, comes out Wednesday, and it's expected to show continued upward pressure even with a sharp drop in gasoline prices in July. That will complicate the central bank's balancing act of using rate increases to temper inflation without tipping the economy into recession. As Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at asset management giant BlackRock, said, the challenge is \"how to execute a 'soft landing' when the economy is coming in hot, and is landing on a runway it has never used before.\" \"Today's print, coming in much stronger than anticipated, complicates the job of a Federal Reserve that seeks to engineer a more temperate employment environment, in keeping with its attempts to moderate current levels of inflation,\" Rieder said in a client note. \"The question though now is how much longer (and higher) will rates have to go before inflation can be brought under control?\"\n\nMore recession signs\n\nFinancial markets were betting against the Fed in other ways. The 2-year Treasury note yield exceeded that of the 10-year note by the highest margin in about 22 years Friday afternoon. That phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, has been a telltale recession sign particularly when it goes on for an extended period of time. In the present case, the inversion has been in place since early July. But that doesn't mean a recession is imminent, only that one is likely over the next year or two. While that means the central bank has some time on its side, it also could mean it won't have the luxury of slow hikes but rather will have to continue to move quickly \u2014 a situation that policymakers had hoped to avoid. \"This is certainly not my base case, but I think that we may start to hear some chatter of an inter-meeting hike, but only if the next batch of inflation reports is hot,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.", "summary": "There is no historical precedent to indicate that an economy in recession can produce 528,000 jobs in a month, as the U.S. did during July.\nBut that doesn't mean there isn't a recession ahead, and, ironically enough, it is the labor market's phenomenal resiliency that could pose the broader economy's biggest long-run danger.\n\"It's not going to be an easy task to continue to tighten without negative repercussions for the consumer and the economy.\"\nThat will complicate the central bank's balancing act of using rate increases to temper inflation without tipping the economy into recession.\nBut that doesn't mean a recession is imminent, only that one is likely over the next year or two."},

She found herself beaten by investors willing to pay cash far above the listing price, and buy sight unseen in gameshow-like bidding wars.\n\nThe 496-sq-ft condo was one of the very few Austin homes she could still afford as prices soared in January. Her offer put her among the finalists, but at the last minute, the seller threw a new curveball: the other bidders had signed an appraisal waiver. Hawkins needed more cash she didn\u2019t have, so she \u201cbowed out\u201d.\n\nAcross the US, many have faced similar roadblocks: prices popped as a confluence of forces suppressed supply and inflated demand, leaving many middle- and lower-income buyers with a dwindling number of housing options, or forcing them into rentership.\n\nSamantha Hawkins at her apartment in Austin. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\nNow, with interest rates rising and the housing market cooling, things are supposed to be different. So far they aren\u2019t. Nationally, house prices hit an all-time high in June of $416,000, up 13.4% from a year ago.\n\nThe challenges Austin buyers are still experiencing show just how difficult the dream of owning your own home has become for a broad swath of Americans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked really hard the last year or two and made the right choices financially to try to have a chance, but it seems like I can\u2019t really win in this market,\u201d Hawkins said.\n\nThe problems plaguing tight markets nationally have all hit Austin. Hawkins is competing with investors who now account for more than 30% of single-family home sales, Airbnb operators and any number of the about 125 people moving to Austin daily amid dizzying job growth. Meanwhile, builders haven\u2019t kept pace with demand and zoning laws limit new multifamily housing that could provide relief.\n\nMay\u2019s median sale prices in Austin and surrounding Travis county hit new peaks of $676,000 and $625,000, respectively \u2013 up from around $400,000 just before the pandemic. That\u2019s put pressure on the rental market, pushing the median rent above $2,700 and fueling displacement.\n\nAnd even though Austin\u2019s June home inventory doubled over the prior year as interest rate hikes cooled demand, supply is only increasing for the wealthiest buyers.\n\nThe portion of national listings that someone earning $75,000 annually could afford dropped from 40% to 25% between January and June as home prices and mortgage rates climbed, National Association of Realtors\u2019 (NAR) data shows.\n\n\u201cThe higher inventory is promising, but not for middle- and lower-income groups,\u201d said Nadia Evangelou, an economist with NAR.\n\nThere\u2019s some evidence of that on the ground. Austin realtor Sherry LeBlanc, who focuses on finding homes for first-time buyers, recently listed a house that could have fetched $515,000 last year for $435,000 with the expectation that middle-income buyers would snap it up. Instead, showings were slow and only investors bid.\n\n\u201cFamilies are scared off by interest rates,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say, \u2018Well, shit, that\u2019s out of my budget.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor those like Hawkins stuck in rentership, the crisis hits on a financial level. Homeownership is a key instrument for wealth building and security, and loss of access to it represents a \u201cbreach of the social contract\u201d, said Austin realtor Socar Chatmon-Thomas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pissing me off because somebody who went to school, got a degree, or otherwise did everything right and now has a job making $60,000 can\u2019t buy a home,\u201d she said.\n\nInvestor demand\n\nEven with a six-figure tech salary, Courtney McKinley couldn\u2019t buy in the city. The parks, restaurants, pools and friends that attracted her to a rental in Austin\u2019s Zilker neighborhood were off the table as the lowest house prices had inched toward $1m.\n\nBut even as she looked around the city\u2019s edge and suburbs, she couldn\u2019t top the cash offers. A $350,000 bid on an over 40-year-old townhouse that \u201cneeded some help\u201d was beaten by an investor who offered $50,000 more in cash. Weeks later, she lost on a dilapidated townhome despite including a $50,000 escalation clause. The next month, an offer $30,000 over asking price on a sun-filled, three-bedroom home that felt perfect was turned down. \u201cThat was a heartbreak moment. I cried after that one,\u201d McKinley said.\n\nAfter more dead ends, she finally won with a $400,000 bid for a two-bedroom that needed a new kitchen, patio, floors and other improvements. It\u2019s in Pflugerville, a sprawling suburb of strip malls and big box stores that\u2019s in a \u201ckind of isolating\u201d location, McKinley said. Ultimately, however, she says she feels lucky: friends have put in up to 15 offers and still don\u2019t have a house.\n\nA new housing development under construction in Pflugerville, Texas. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\n\u201cIt was a rollercoaster, but no matter how difficult and frustrating it was, at least I\u2019m building equity now,\u201d she said.\n\nFor middle-class Austinites like McKinley being outbid by cash offers in Austin, this much feels clear: investors are part of the problem.\n\nWhile some argue the percentage of investor-owned single family purchases nationally remains low, tight \u201csun belt\u201d markets like metro Austin have seen it double from about 15% throughout the mid-2010s to over 30% in 2022\u2019s first quarter. And investors often target the type of homes that middle-income earners like McKinley are seeking, as well as those in lower-income, minority neighborhoods\n\n\u201cInvestors are not focused on the higher end of the market,\u201d said Georgia Tech urban planning professor Elora Lee Raymond. \u201cIt\u2019s entry-level homes that are being snapped up and are incredibly difficult to purchase at this time.\u201d\n\nBeyond having the resources to place higher bids and pay with cash, investors often buy homes sight unseen, and typically skip appraisals and inspections. Some companies also use algorithms to place bids within hours of homes being listed, and Wall Street-backed institutional investors are viewed as particularly problematic.\n\nThe five largest private equity buyers added 76,000 homes to their portfolio between March 2018 and September 2021, and their model has been derided by critics as \u201cindustrial housing\u201d as they maximize profits by raising rents and skimping on maintenance.\n\nA June US House committee investigation highlighting private equity\u2019s role in local housing crises noted corporate landlords in Atlanta were up to 205 times more likely to evict tenants, and increased rents by an average of 37-57% within a year of purchasing properties.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s virtually impossible to quantify how much investors are pushing up home prices, and the situation is a \u201cchicken and egg\u201d question, said Thom Malone, an economist for real estate data analyst CoreLogic.\n\nA new home, right, towers over residences on the same street in the Montopolis neighborhood in south-east Austin. Photograph: Jordan Vonderhaar/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n\u201cWhere investors go, prices go up, but to what extent is this because the prices were going up because demand increased?\u201d Malone asked. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a bit of both.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, another breed of investor is depleting stock in tourist-friendly areas: short-term rental operators. Though the city says Airbnb owners operate about 3,000 units, housing advocate Inside Airbnb gleaned the company\u2019s listings and found about 12,000, including 10,000 whole home units. And that accounts for one company \u2013 the true number of short-term rentals is probably much higher.\n\nIn one east Austin neighborhood, Airbnb in June controlled about 12% of the housing units, Inside Airbnb found. While about 270 units were available for long-term rent during a 2020 US census survey, more than 1,300 whole home units were available on Airbnb in June.\n\n\u201cEven without some economic researcher looking into it, common sense tells you that these are entire apartments that are no longer available, and people will be directly or indirectly displaced,\u201d said Inside Airbnb founder Murray Cox.\n\nShort supply\n\nThe signs of a construction boom are evident across Travis county, the fifth-most populous county in Texas. Along the metro region\u2019s edges, new neighborhoods and strip malls are multiplying, while closer to the city core in south Austin, expensive new condo buildings have sprouted among the old restaurants, strip malls and pawn shops on Congress Avenue.\n\nCars sit parked outside Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory on the east side of Austin. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\nThough Austin has grown at an exceptional clip for decades, the recent population spike is partly driven by tech: Oracle, Tesla, Meta, HP Enterprise and many more have relocated or opened offices here. That\u2019s coupled with demand from New York and California buyers who relocated during the pandemic, and millennials entering the market.\n\nMonthly new construction home closures in Austin in 2021 were up by 53% from pre-pandemic highs, CoreLogic data shows, but the city is struggling to build its way out of the crisis: supply chain squeezes and labor shortages observers pin on Trump\u2019s immigration policies have slowed the construction cycle.\n\n\u201cSupply is a tortoise and demand is a gazelle, so when there\u2019s a sudden increase in demand, it takes years for new supply to come on the market, and in the meantime there\u2019s this huge surge in prices,\u201d said Jake Wegmann, a University of Texas regional planning professor.\n\nA recent proposal to overhaul Austin\u2019s zoning ordinance would have allowed for more apartment buildings, increased the number of townhomes and simplified the approval process. The changes would allow the city to build \u201cthousands more units\u201d annually, but Nimby-ism and anti-growth forces shut it down, Wegmann said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to make it sound like this would\u2019ve solved everything, but we\u2019re really tying our own hand behind our back,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2018I pray every night\u2019\n\nPaola Valdez-Lopez cleans while her kids, Alycia, five, and Matias, six, eat dinner in Austin. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\nSoaring home prices ultimately create pressure lower in the market, hitting the city\u2019s most vulnerable the hardest. Six months ago, Paola Valdez and her husband made the last $500 payment on their three-bedroom trailer set in a south Austin mobile home park. The extra money was welcome as the couple raised two young kids, and they were proud to own the home outright.\n\nBut everything changed in early July. The California investor who recently purchased the Congress Mobile Home Park handed 60-day eviction notices to its residents, and leaving isn\u2019t easy \u2013 Valdez\u2019s trailer can\u2019t be transported because it\u2019s 30 years old.\n\nA new, smaller trailer is $1,500 a month plus the lot fee, and three-bedroom apartments in her neighborhood top $3,500 a month. The family is at a loss over what it will do next, but Valdez expects her days of staying home to raise the kids are done.\n\n\u201cOne day you\u2019re fine, you\u2019ve paid off your home and you\u2019re making a nest, then all the sudden you\u2019re bombarded with \u2018You\u2019ve got to leave in 60 days\u2019,\u201d Valdez said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to stay strong. I pray every night.\u201d\n\nLeft: A notice of non-renewal of lease for Paola Valdez-Lopez. Right: Edvin Agular embraces his wife, Valdez-Lopez. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\nAs median rent jumped 48% year over year, state records analyzed by the Guardian data show Travis County evictions hit record monthly highs in March and April. That\u2019s partially fueled by investors purchasing apartment buildings with affordable rents and turning them into pricey condos, said Mincho Jacob, a spokesperson with housing advocate Basta Austin.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s destroying the heart of Austin because people with long roots here are evicted and forced out,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are few tools to do anything about it in Texas where the Republican-controlled legislature largely banned rent control, and though housing advocates have had some success in warding off developer purchases of affordable housing, it hasn\u2019t been enough. Similarly, wide-scale displacement continues even though Austin voters since 2018 have approved $550m for affordable housing and anti-displacement measures.\n\nAnother link between the higher home prices and rental pressure is those like Hawkins, who have been shut out of ownership. But with a recent salary increase in her career, she\u2019s regrouping and saving money, and says she\u2019s determined as ever to own.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a goal of mine for a really long time, and since there\u2019s been so many failed attempts, I just want to prove to myself that I can do it,\u201d she said.", "summary": "The 496-sq-ft condo was one of the very few Austin homes she could still afford as prices soared in January.\nThe challenges Austin buyers are still experiencing show just how difficult the dream of owning your own home has become for a broad swath of Americans.\nThe problems plaguing tight markets nationally have all hit Austin.\nThough the city says Airbnb owners operate about 3,000 units, housing advocate Inside Airbnb gleaned the company\u2019s listings and found about 12,000, including 10,000 whole home units.\nIn one east Austin neighborhood, Airbnb in June controlled about 12% of the housing units, Inside Airbnb found."},

Card 1 of 5 Inflation F.A.Q. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. Inflation F.A.Q. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Inflation F.A.Q. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. Inflation F.A.Q. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Inflation F.A.Q. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks.

Thomas\u2019s \u201csolid money\u201d habit hasn\u2019t just changed her attitude to Starbucks; it\u2019s changed the way she spends and saves entirely.\n\nResearch shows that we experience the \u2018pain of paying\u2019 when spending cash. Photograph: georgeclerk/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nThomas is not the only one turning to cash during the cost of living crisis. In July, more than \u00a3800m in banknotes was withdrawn from Post Office counters, a 20% rise from the same month the year before. Martin Kearsley, banking director at the Post Office, told the BBC: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more people increasingly reliant on cash as the tried-and-tested way to manage a budget.\u201d\n\nSince records began five years ago, Post Office withdrawals have exceeded \u00a3800m only once before \u2013 and that was last Christmas, a time when a lot of cash is tucked into cards. Shortly after UK wages fell at their fastest rate in 20 years, Kearsley said it was clear that Britain is \u201canything but a cashless society\u201d.\n\nThomas first ditched her debit card post-lockdown after she was troubled by her online spending during the pandemic, but she says her cash-only budget is helping her to prepare for rising costs. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m ahead of the game, I feel like I\u2019ve got an advantage,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be tricky, but I feel like I\u2019ve already got lots of tools in place to help me.\u201d\n\nContactless promotes increased spending and increased use of debt Warwick business school\n\nPersonal finance and consumer expert Sue Hayward concurs that \u201chanding over cold hard cash often makes you think twice about how much you\u2019re spending\u201d. She also notes that it\u2019s easier to keep track of purchases when paying with banknotes, \u201cas contactless payments can take several days to show up on your statement\u201d.\n\nIn 2020, researchers from Warwick business school analysed more than 300m transactions from 260,000 consumers and found that people with contactless cards spent \u201csignificantly more\u201d than those without. Contactless spenders were also more likely to be charged overdraft fees and made more purchases overall. The researchers concluded that contactless: \u201cpromotes increased spending and can promote decreased cash usage and increased use of debt.\u201d\n\nConversely, almost 30 years of academic research have shown that we experience the \u201cpain of paying\u201d when spending cash: handing over money feels like losing it, activating the insular cortex, the part of our brain that deals with physical pain. (Interestingly, it seems that some alternatives to cash are less painful than others. One 2018 paper, from the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, found that consumers feel lower levels of pain when they pay with mobile phones and smartwatches than when they use credit cards.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just being savvy and going back to old-school ways,\u201d Thomas says of her cash use. On her YouTube channel, The Budget Mum UK, she shows her 2,600 subscribers how she withdraws her wage at the start of the month and separates the notes into different laminated envelopes. Among others, there\u2019s an envelope for food shopping, one for travel, one for credit card debt and one for emergencies.\n\nOld-style budgeting \u2026 \u2018cash stuffing\u2019 involves setting aside money in envelopes, one for each expense. Photograph: FotoDuets/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nOn social media, this budgeting technique is called \u201ccash stuffing\u201d: the envelopes help people keep track of their spending and saving without complicated spreadsheets. Google searches for the technique spiked at the beginning of the year, and TikTok videos hashtagged #cashstuffing have now accumulated almost 550m views.\n\nJade Edmondson is a 29-year-old teaching assistant from Coventry who sells cash-stuffing materials such as labelled plastic envelopes, binders and savings tracking sheets on her Etsy page. She says she has seen a recent rise in sales. In total, Edmondson personally uses 30 cash-stuffing envelopes for things such as petrol money, Christmas savings and her Slimming World membership. Putting away money gradually in one envelope over the course of the year helps Edmondson save for bigger costs: she now has \u00a3350 saved to buy her four children\u2019s school uniforms. \u201cIf this was me last year, I would be panicking: \u2018How am I going to pay for all of this?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cWhereas actually now, I don\u2019t worry about money.\u201d\n\nYet a cash-only lifestyle can cause problems in an increasingly cashless society. In 2010, half of the UK\u2019s transactional payments were made in cash, but by 2020, this had dropped to just 17%. A number of shops banned cash payments for public health reasons during the pandemic, but a 2021 survey by Which? found that one in five consumers had been prevented from making a cash payment between April and July of 2021, when restrictions were easing.\n\nThe reality is you will pay more using cash because you can\u2019t shop online Natalie Cenney\n\nThomas has run into trouble when paying for petrol \u2013 and when she sent her daughter to the cinema with cash recently, she was unable to buy her ticket and snacks. \u201cIt\u2019s just been trial and error,\u201d she says. Six weeks ago, she decided to set up Apple Pay on her phone as a backup for emergencies, but she refuses to leave her credit card in her car to avoid temptation.\n\nNatalie Ceeney, chair of the Cash Action Group, says many small businesses don\u2019t accept cash because it\u2019s increasingly difficult to deposit takings due to the closure of high street banks. Ceeney is now campaigning to get ATMs to take cash deposits (you can currently do this inside banks, but opening hours can be prohibitive). However, she says, \u201csetting up a whole new network\u201d is \u201cnot quick\u201d. Meanwhile, Ceeney notes that many consumers depend on cash due to \u201csome form of vulnerability\u201d, such as not having a proper internet connection, smartphone or bank account, or having a disability. A May study by the Royal Society of Arts found that 15 million people in the UK rely on cash to budget.\n\n\u201cThe main reason people will tell you they use cash is for budgeting: you can see it, you can feel it,\u201d Ceeney says. \u201cWith the cost of living crisis, more people are strapped for cash so it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that people are going back to using cash, withdrawing money to get through the week safely without getting overdrawn.\u201d\n\nAlthough cash can have its advantages, Ceeney warns that there\u2019s a \u201cpoverty premium\u201d when avoiding cards. \u201cThe reality is, if you can\u2019t shop online you will pay more using cash because you can\u2019t get online deals or direct debits where you often get a discount, you can\u2019t shop around or buy in bulk,\u201d she says. Ceeney explains that although many families know this, they\u2019re \u201cgoing back to cash because they can\u2019t afford to go overdrawn \u2013 this is about necessity\u201d.\n\nEven with cash-stuffing systems in place, Thomas and Edmondson are concerned about the ever-increasing cost of living. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s going to be a big hurdle,\u201d Thomas says of rising bills, while Edmondson adds: \u201cIt\u2019s still very nerve-racking. It\u2019s like: \u2018Where are we going to find this extra money from?\u2019\u201d While using cash can be helpful for individual consumers, it is not a substitute for government intervention, nor a long-term solution to our economic crisis. With food prices rising at their fastest pace in 14 years and annual energy bills expected to cost two months\u2019 worth of wages next year, coins can only go so far.\n\nAdditional reporting by Rachel Hall", "summary": "\u201cWhen you\u2019re physically handing over solid money,\u201d she says, \u201cit just makes you think twice.\u201dFor the last 12 months, Thomas has been a cash-only consumer.\nAs a result, Thomas could \u201csit here and tell you to the penny\u201d what most items in the supermarket cost.\nResearch shows that we experience the \u2018pain of paying\u2019 when spending cash.\nPhotograph: georgeclerk/Getty Images/iStockphotoThomas is not the only one turning to cash during the cost of living crisis.\nEven with cash-stuffing systems in place, Thomas and Edmondson are concerned about the ever-increasing cost of living."},

Here\u2019s why UK beer costs are far outpacing inflation", "author": ["Elliot Smith"], "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/05/why-the-price-of-a-pint-of-beer-in-the-uk-is-going-through-the-roof.html", "content": "LONDON \u2014 The average cost of a pint of beer in the U.K. has soared by 70% since 2008 \u2014 well ahead of inflation \u2014 and some Londoners are parting with as much as \u00a38 ($9.70) for 568ml of the amber nectar. According to figures from consultancy firm CGA, the average cost of a pint has risen from \u00a32.30 in 2008 to \u00a33.95 in 2022, though prices vary drastically across locations. Average prices rose by 15 pence between 2021 and 2022, up almost 4%, one of the largest year-on-year increases since 2008. The average price of a pint at one unnamed pub in London hit an eye-watering \u00a38.06 this year, the highest CGA has ever recorded, while the lowest nationally was a \u00a31.79 average at a pub in Lancashire, in the northwest of England. U.K. inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.4% in June and is expected to rise beyond 13% in October, compounding the country's historic cost-of-living crisis and prompting the Bank of England to implement its largest interest rate hike since 1995 on Thursday. Many pubs and hospitality venues are concerned that consumers will increasingly stay at home. Paul Bolton, client director for GB drinks at CGA, told CNBC that a combination of supply chain issues, staffing shortages, soaring energy costs, lingering pandemic-era debts and generally high inflation are increasing suppliers' cost pressures, which then have to be passed onto the consumer. Raw materials and energy Francois Sonneville, senior beverage analyst at Rabobank, told CNBC that prices are increasing throughout the value chain, starting with barley. \"The barley price has gone up, and has doubled since 2021. There's two reasons for that: one is that the harvest in North America was really poor, driven by a poor climate, so there was not much inventory to start with \u2013 and then, of course, we had the Black Sea region conflict,\" he told CNBC's Arabile Gumede.\n\nA pint of Adnams Ghost Ship Citrus pale Ale. The Suffolk-based brewer says a combination of soaring energy, labor and raw material costs is squeezing businesses and driving up the price of a pint. Geography Photos/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nHistorically, when grain prices increased, farmers would compensate by planting more the following year, but broader agricultural inflation is also putting a squeeze on farms, outpacing even the 40-year high of 9.4% headline inflation in the U.K. \"Where our normal inflation is running at 8, 9%, (agricultural) inflation for our businesses is running somewhere over 22, 23%,\" explained Richard Hirst, owner of Hirst Farms in Suffolk. \"That's a function of obviously oil prices, fuel \u2013 our tractor diesel has gone up more than three times in price, which is a lot more, relatively, than road fuel has gone up.\" Hirst said the farm is also facing substantial labor cost increases, with shortages affecting the farming industry nationwide, along with fertilizer costs. \"Fertilizer costs will have tripled for next year \u2013 we're buying fertilizer now three times what it was last year. Our chemical inputs are going up and just the cost of running machinery, whether it's spare parts or actually just the cost of buying machinery itself. All that has gone up an awful lot more than the 9 or 10% of normal inflation.\"\n\nHowever, barley is not the main cost incurred during the brewing process \u2013 in fact, it only contributes around 5% of the price of beer at the tap. The biggest costs, analysts and business leaders told CNBC, come from labor, packaging and energy. \"I think that if you look at the brewing process itself, it uses a lot of energy \u2013 and the energy price has gone up, as we all know, when we stop at the pump \u2013 but the most important one is probably packaging,\" Sonneville said. \"Packaging makes up about 25 to 30% of the cost price of beer, and glass packaging, glass bottles, use about 25% of their cost in energy, so with gas prices going 10 times higher now than they were two years ago, that has a massive impact on the cost of a brewer.\" Labor of love His comments were echoed by Andy Wood, CEO of Suffolk-based brewery and hospitality business Adnams, who told CNBC that the energy price increases the company is seeing are \"absolutely eye-watering.\" \"Brewing beer or distilling spirits involves a lot of boiling water, so that involves lots of energy to get to that state, although we've put quite a number of innovations in over the years to limit the impact of that,\" he explained. Wood said in the aftermath of Brexit and the pandemic, a tightening of the U.K. labor market is also exerting upward wage pressure, which will likely be exacerbated by the country's escalating cost-of-living crisis. \"The biggest cost that we have is our payroll because the hospitality part of that business is a people-driven business,\" he added. What's more, the geopolitical headwinds facing businesses throughout the supply chain are unlikely to abate any time soon.\n\n\"So we've got Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we've got the energy crisis that that's brought on, we've got the food supply crisis, grain, cooking oils, these types of things, and then \u2026 we hear in the media that China may be looking longingly at Taiwan, so I think the geopolitical situation is getting no easier, so I think these things are here to stay,\" he said. The question for businesses, according to both Wood and Sonneville, is how many of these costs they can absorb, how much should be passed onto consumers, and in the midst of a cost of living crisis, how to sustain margins without forcing the consumer to stay at home and jeopardizing volumes. Brewers tend to have long-term contracts and hedges in place to ensure contingency plans for future price rises, meaning not all of their costs are fully reflected at present, and therefore not immediately passed onto consumers. \"I think if you look at the price of beer that you and I pay, there is a risk that that will go higher, because there is a lagging effect of costs at the brewery because of those long-term contracts,\" Sonneville said on Monday. \"The hope that I think is there at brewers is that prices will come down. We have not seen that in gas \u2014 we've seen more sanctions there and gas prices have actually risen in the last three days \u2014 but we have seen that grain prices have come off a little bit, and the hope is that that will continue.\" Shifting trends Wood noted that consumer sentiment and behavior had already begun to shift in the face of higher prices at the bar. \"We're certainly seeing people come out earlier in the evening, having their drinks, having their dinner, and then they're going back home,\" he said. \"We're seeing people perhaps having two courses rather than three courses, and perhaps having a glass of wine rather than a bottle of wine, so we are seeing some changes in consumer behavior, there is no doubt about that.\" This was reflected in CGA's latest consumer analysis, which found that premium products and venues offering particularly unique experiences were increasing their share of the on-trade.", "summary": "Average prices rose by 15 pence between 2021 and 2022, up almost 4%, one of the largest year-on-year increases since 2008.\nThe Suffolk-based brewer says a combination of soaring energy, labor and raw material costs is squeezing businesses and driving up the price of a pint.\nHirst said the farm is also facing substantial labor cost increases, with shortages affecting the farming industry nationwide, along with fertilizer costs.\n\"Fertilizer costs will have tripled for next year \u2013 we're buying fertilizer now three times what it was last year.\nLabor of love His comments were echoed by Andy Wood, CEO of Suffolk-based brewery and hospitality business Adnams, who told CNBC that the energy price increases the company is seeing are \"absolutely eye-watering.\""},

Here's a recap of Tuesday's key moments: We want growth without inflation WMT, HD earnings beats boost retailers Quick mentions: CTRA, DIS, WFC 1. We want growth without inflation Stocks were mixed Tuesday, with tech names keeping a lid on the Nasdaq as bond yields moved higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up for its fifth straight session. West Texas Intermediate crude, the American oil benchmark, fell 2.5%, which bodes well for inflation. Jim Cramer has repeatedly said that he believes oil's peak in June helped cool down inflation in July. While the market and economy have shown promising signs recently, Jim emphasized Tuesday: \"We want growth without inflation. We don't want oil to be too hot.\" 2. WMT, HD earnings beats boost retailers Home Depot (HD) and Walmart (WMT) reported earnings beats before the bell on Tuesday, pushing other retailers' stocks up, including Club holding Costco (COST). While we held positions in both Walmart and Costco earlier this year, we sold off the former after its warnings of excess inventory and the potential impact to its bottom line. Costco, on the other hand, has not faced the same kind of inventory issues. It's also successfully raised prices for some items and held prices steady for others, all while maintaining strong sales. This week is chock-full of other retailers reporting earnings. See a list here . We'll be watching each one as they reveal their financial results, and in turn, provide insights on consumers spending and inflation. 3. Quick mentions: CTRA, DIS, WFC We also have updates on some other Club names. Natural gas soared roughly 5% on Tuesday, spiking to its highest level since late July. This is good news for Club holding Coterra Energy (CTRA), which Jim calls \"the best natural gas company in the country.\" We have reviewed Dan Loeb's recommendations on Disney (DIS), and we believe there's nothing revelatory there. Cost cutting, for example, is something we're sure the company already has on its radar. As for Loeb's urging that Disney spin off ESPN, we believe that while that could be good for the company's bottom-line in the short-term, having a live sports component to its streaming is crucial, especially since it helps differentiate its product from other services like Netflix (NFLX). Banks have been performing well recently, and we believe that the best ones to own right now are Bank of America (BAC) and Club holding Wells Fargo (WFC) for their large deposit bases.

Scott Mlyn | CNBC\n\nIt wasn't long ago that Amazon, Shopify and Peloton doubled their workforces to manage through the pandemic surge, while Morgan Stanley staffed up to handle a record level of IPOs, and mortgage lenders added headcount as rock-bottom rates led to a refinancing boom. On the flipside, Delta Air Lines, Hilton Worldwide and legions of restaurants slashed headcount because of lockdowns that rolled through much of the country and other parts of the world. Now, they're scrambling to reverse course. Companies that hired like crazy in 2020 and 2021 to meet customer demand are being forced to make sweeping cuts or impose hiring freezes with a possible recession on the horizon. In a matter of months, CEOs have gone from hypergrowth mode to concerns over \"macroeconomic uncertainty,\" a phrase investors have heard many times on second-quarter earnings calls. Stock trading app Robinhood and crypto exchange Coinbase both recently slashed more than 1,000 jobs after their splashy market debuts in 2021. Meanwhile, airlines, hotels and eateries face the opposite problem as their businesses continue to pick up following the era of Covid-induced shutdowns. After instituting mass layoffs early in the pandemic, they can't hire quickly enough to satisfy demand and are dealing with a labor market radically different from the one they experienced over two years ago, before the cutbacks. \"The pandemic created very unique, once-in-a-lifetime conditions in many different industries that caused a dramatic reallocation of capital,\" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at job recruiting site ZipRecruiter. \"Many of those conditions no longer apply so you're seeing a reallocation of capital back to more normal patterns.\"\n\nFor employers, those patterns are particularly challenging to navigate, because inflation levels have jumped to a 40-year high, and the Fed has lifted its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point on consecutive occasions for the first time since the early 1990s. The central bank's efforts to tamp down inflation have raised concerns that the U.S. economy is headed for recession. Gross domestic product has fallen for two straight quarters, hitting a widely accepted rule of thumb for recession, though the National Bureau of Economic Research hasn't yet made that declaration. The downward trend was bound to happen eventually, and market experts lamented the frothiness in stock prices and absurdity of valuations as late as the fourth quarter of last year, when the major indexes hit record highs led by the riskiest assets. That was never more evident than in November, when electric vehicle maker Rivian went public on almost no revenue and quickly reached a market cap of over $150 billion. Bitcoin hit a record the same day, touching close to $69,000. Since then, bitcoin is off by two-thirds, and Rivian has lost about 80% of its value. In July, the car company started layoffs of about 6% of its workforce. Rivian's headcount almost quintupled to around 14,000 between late 2020 and mid-2022.\n\nTech layoffs and an air of caution\n\nJob cuts and hiring slowdowns were big talking points on tech earnings calls last week. Amazon reduced its headcount by 99,000 people to 1.52 million employees at the end of the second quarter after almost doubling in size during the pandemic, when it needed to beef up its warehouse capabilities. Shopify, whose cloud technology helps retailers build and manage online stores, cut about 1,000 workers, or around 10% of its global workforce. The company doubled its headcount over a two-year period starting at the beginning of 2020, as the business boomed from the number or stores and restaurants that had to suddenly go digital. Shopify CEO Tobias Lutke said in a memo to employees that the company had wagered that the pandemic surge would cause the transition from physical retail to ecommerce to \"permanently leap ahead by 5 or even 10 years.\" \"It's now clear that bet didn't pay off,\" Lutke wrote, adding that the picture was starting to look more like it did before Covid. \"Ultimately, placing this bet was my call to make and I got this wrong. Now, we have to adjust.\" After Facebook parent Meta missed on its results and forecast a second straight quarter of declining revenue, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will be reducing job growth over the next year. Headcount expanded by about 60% during the pandemic. \"This is a period that demands more intensity and I expect us to get more done with fewer resources,\" Zuckerberg said. Google parent Alphabet, which grew its workforce by over 30% during the two Covid years, recently told employees that they needed to focus and improve productivity. The company asked for suggestions on how to be more efficient at work.\n\n\"It's clear we are facing a challenging macro environment with more uncertainty ahead,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said in a meeting with employees. \"We should think about how we can minimize distractions and really raise the bar on both product excellence and productivity.\" Few U.S. companies have been hit as hard as Peloton, whose fitness equipment and on-demand classes became an instant gym replacement during lockdowns and which has since suffered from massive oversupply issues and out-of-control costs. After doubling headcount in the 12 months ended June 30, 2021, the company in February announced plans to cut 20% of corporate positions as it named a new CEO.\n\nBanks and Wall Street bracing for a 'hurricane'\n\nSome of the Peloton products that were flying off the shelves in the pandemic were being offered as perks for overworked junior bankers, who were sorely needed to help manage a boom in IPOs, mergers and stock issuance. Activity picked up with such ferocity that junior bankers were complaining about 100-hour workweeks, and banks started scouting for talent in unusual places like consulting and accounting firms. That helps explain why the six biggest U.S. banks added a combined 59,757 employees from the start of 2020 through the middle of 2022, the equivalent of the industry picking up the full population of a Morgan Stanley or a Goldman Sachs in a little over two years. It wasn't just investment banking. The government unleashed trillions of dollars in stimulus payments and small business loans designed to keep the economy moving amid the widespread shutdowns. A feared wave of loan defaults never arrived, and banks instead took in an unprecedented flood of deposits. Their Main Street lending operations had better repayment rates than before the pandemic. Among top banks, Morgan Stanley saw the biggest jump in headcount, with its employee levels expanding 29% to 78,386 from early 2020 to the middle of this year. The growth was fueled in part by CEO James Gorman\u2019s acquisitions of money management firms E-Trade and Eaton Vance. At rival investment bank Goldman Sachs, staffing levels jumped 22% to 47,000 in the same time frame, as CEO David Solomon broke into consumer finance and bolstered wealth management operations, including through the acquisition of fintech lender GreenSky. Citigroup saw a 15% boost in headcount during the pandemic, while JPMorgan Chase added 8.5% to its workforce, becoming the industry's largest employer. But the good times on Wall Street didn\u2019t last. The stock market had its worst first half in 50 years, and IPOs dried up. Investment banking revenue at the major players declined sharply in the second quarter. Goldman Sachs responded by slowing hiring and is considering a return to year-end job reductions, according to a person with knowledge of the bank\u2019s plans. Employees typically make up the single biggest line item when it comes to expenses in banking, so when markets crater, layoffs are usually on the horizon. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in June that an economic \"hurricane\" was on its way, and said the bank was bracing itself for volatile markets.\n\nJamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., during a Bloomberg Television interview in London, U.K., on Wednesday, May 4, 2022.

She said 60% more people went into real estate in 2020 and 2021 because of record low mortgage rates and rising home prices. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo have reportedly trimmed hundreds of mortgage staffers as volumes collapsed. \"Nobody is refinancing anymore, and sales are slowing,\" Pollak said. \"You're going to have to see employment levels and hiring slow down. That growth was all about that moment.\" The intersection of Silicon Valley and Wall Street is a particularly gloomy place at the moment as rising rates and crumbling stock multiples converge. Crypto trading platform Coinbase in June announced plans to lay off 18% of its workforce in preparation for a \"crypto winter\" and even rescinded job offers to people it had hired. Headcount tripled in 2021 to 3,730 employees. Stock trading app Robinhood said Tuesday it's cutting about 23% of its workforce, a little over three months after eliminating 9% of its full-time staff, which had ballooned from 2,100 to 3,800 in the last nine months of 2021. \"We are at the tail end of that pandemic-era distortion,\" said Aaron Terrazas, chief economist at job search and review site Glassdoor. \"Obviously, it's not going away, but it is changing to a more normalized period, and companies are adapting to this new reality.\"\n\nRetail is whipsawing back and forth\n\nNurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThey hardly could have predicted how quickly the dynamic would shift, as rapid and soaring inflation forced Americans to tighten their belts. Retailers have already started to warn of waning demand, leaving them with bloated inventories. Gap said higher promotions will hurt gross margins in its fiscal second quarter. Kohl's cut its guidance for the second quarter, citing softened consumer spending. Walmart last week slashed its profit forecast and said surging prices for food and gas are squeezing consumers. That pain is filtering into the ad market. Online bulletin board Pinterest on Monday cited \"lower than expected demand from U.S. big box retailers and mid-market advertisers\" as one reason why it missed Wall Street estimates for second-quarter earnings and revenue. Retail giants have so far avoided big layoff announcements, but smaller players are in cut mode. Stitch Fix, 7-Eleven and Game Stop have said they'll be eliminating jobs, and outdoor grill maker Weber warned it's considering layoffs as sales slow.\n\nThe travel industry can't hire fast enough\n\nWith all of the downsizing taking place across wide swaths of the U.S. economy, the applicant pool should be wide open for airlines, restaurants and hospitality companies, which are trying to repopulate their ranks after undergoing mass layoffs when Covid hit. It's not so easy. Even though Amazon has reduced headcount of late, it's still got far more people working in its warehouses than it did two years ago. Last year the company lifted average starting pay to $18 an hour, a level that's difficult to meet for much of the services industry. Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta said on the quarterly earnings call in May that he wasn't satisfied with customer service and that the company needs more workers. At the end of last year, even as travel was rebounding sharply, headcount at Hilton's managed, owned and leased properties as well as corporate locations was down by over 30,000 from two years earlier. It's easy to see why customer service is a challenge. According to a report last week from McKinsey on summer 2022 travel trends, revenue per available room in the U.S. \"is outstripping not just 2020 and 2021 levels, but increasingly 2019 levels too.\"\n\nDelta Airlines passenger jets are pictured outside the newly completed 1.3 million-square foot $4 billion Delta Airlines Terminal C at LaGuardia Airport in New York, June 1, 2022.

The number of homes for sale in the U.S. increased by 2 percent in June for the first time since 2019.\n\nPrice gains are still strong because of an imbalance between supply and demand. The housing market has had a severe shortage for years. Strong demand during the coronavirus pandemic exacerbated it.\n\nHome prices are still higher than they were a year ago, but the gains slowed at the fastest pace on record in June, according to Black Knight, a mortgage software, data and analytics firm that began tracking this metric in the early 1970s. The annual rate of price appreciation fell two percentage points from 19.3% to 17.3%.\n\nRising mortgage rates and inflation in the wider economy caused housing demand to drop sharply in June, forcing home prices to cool down.\n\nEven when home prices crashed dramatically during the recession of 2007-09, the strongest single-month slowdown was 1.19 percentage points. Prices are not expected to fall nationally, given a stronger overall housing market, but higher mortgage rates are certainly taking their toll.\n\nThe average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage crossed above 6% in June, according to Mortgage News Daily. It has since dropped back into the lower 5% range, but that is still significantly higher than the 3% range rates were in at the start of this year.\n\n\"The slowdown was broad-based among the top 50 markets at the metro level, with some areas experiencing even more pronounced cooling,\" said Ben Graboske, president of Black Knight Data & Analytics. \"In fact, 25% of major U.S. markets saw growth slow by three percentage points in June, with four decelerating by four or more points in that month alone.\"\n\nStill, while this was the sharpest cooling on record nationally, the market would have to see six more months of this kind of deceleration for price growth to return to long-run averages, according to Graboske. He calculates that it takes about five months for interest rate impacts to be fully reflected in home prices.\n\nMarkets seeing the sharpest drops are those that previously had the highest prices in the nation. Average home values in San Jose, California, have fallen 5.1% in the last two months, the biggest drop of any of the top markets. That chopped $75,000 off the price.\n\nIn Seattle, prices are down 3.8% in the past two months, or a $30,000 reduction. San Francisco, San Diego and Denver round out the top five markets with the biggest price reductions.\n\nThe cooling in prices coincides with a sharp jump in the supply of homes for sale, up 22% over the last two months, according to Black Knight. Inventory is still, however, 54% lower than 2017-19 levels.\n\n\"With a national shortage of more than 700,000 listings, it would take more than a year of such record increases for inventory levels to fully normalize,\" said Graboske.\n\nPrice drops will not affect the average homeowner as much as they did during the Great Recession, because homeowners today have considerably more equity. Tight underwriting and several years of strong price appreciation caused home equity levels to hit record highs.\n\nDespite that, the strong demand in the market recently could present a problem for some. About 10% of mortgaged properties were purchased in the last year, so price drops could cause some borrowers to edge much lower in their equity positions.", "summary": "Rising mortgage rates and inflation in the wider economy caused housing demand to drop sharply in June, forcing home prices to cool down.\nEven when home prices crashed dramatically during the recession of 2007-09, the strongest single-month slowdown was 1.19 percentage points.\nPrices are not expected to fall nationally, given a stronger overall housing market, but higher mortgage rates are certainly taking their toll.\nThe average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage crossed above 6% in June, according to Mortgage News Daily.\nTight underwriting and several years of strong price appreciation caused home equity levels to hit record highs."},

I'm focused on the wage data. And so far, inflation continues to surprise us to the upside. Wages continue to grow.\"\n\nLast month, U.S. inflation jumped to a four-decade record high, rising 9.1% from a year ago. At the same time, the labor market remained strong: Nonfarm payrolls increased by 372,000 last month, alongside a low national unemployment rate of 3.6%.\n\nOn Thursday, new Labor Department data showed signs of a job market cooldown, with initial jobless claims hitting their highest level since mid-November. Still, Kashkari said, the labor market is \"very, very strong.\"\n\n\"Typically, recessions demonstrate high job losses, high unemployment, those are terrible for American families. And we're not seeing anything like that,\" he said.\n\nThe problem, Kashkari said, is that even in a strong job market, inflation is outpacing wage growth \u2014 giving many Americans a functional \"wage cut\" as living costs increase nationwide. Solving that problem by reducing inflation is the Federal Reserve's top goal right now, he added.\n\n\"Whether we are technically in a recession or not doesn't change the fact that the Federal Reserve has its own work to do, and we are committed to doing it,\" Kashkari said.\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Thursday that the country's gross domestic product shrunk for the second straight quarter, often a warning sign accompanying economic recessions. For Kashkari, that may actually be a good thing: An economic slowdown could help reduce inflation to the point where it no longer outpaces wage growth.\n\n\"We definitely want to see some slowing [of economic growth],\" he said. \"We don't want to see the economy overheating. We would love it if we could transition to a sustainable economy without tipping the economy into recession.\"\n\nDoing so poses a significant challenge for the Fed. Kashkari acknowledged that economic slowdowns tend to be very difficult to control, \"especially if it's the central bank that's inducing the slowdown.\"\n\nStill, he said, the bank will do whatever is necessary to tame inflation.\n\n\"We're going to do everything we can to avoid a recession, but we are committed to bringing inflation down, and we are going to do what we need to do,\" Kashkari said. \"We are a long way away from achieving an economy that is back at 2% inflation.
