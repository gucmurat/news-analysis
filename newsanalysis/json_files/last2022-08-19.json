Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/REX/Shutterstock\n\nRailway reforms will be imposed if workers do not agree to new deals, the transport secretary Grant Shapps has said.\n\nThe Conservative party has repeatedly targeted unions with criticism, in a move that the Trades Union Congress has argued it is deliberately \u201cpicking a fight\u201d for electoral purposes.\n\nShapps is likely to remain transport secretary until at least 5 September, when a new Conservative party leader \u2013 likely to be Liz Truss if recent polls are correct \u2013 will be in place. There is little sign that there would be a change of attitude under a new leader.\n\nAsked on Monday by Sky News if compulsory redundancies were on the table for rail workers, Grant Shapps said (the Press Association reports):\n\nThe deal that is on the table actually means largely no compulsory redundancies at all. If [the unions] are not prepared to put that deal to your membership we will never know whether members would accept it. What I do know and I can say for sure is if we can\u2019t get this settled in the way that we are proposing, which is \u2018please put the deal to your membership\u2019 then we will have to move to what is called a section 188; it is a process of actually requiring these changes to go into place so it becomes mandated. That is the direction that this is moving in now.\n\nShapps claimed that outdated work practices needed to be updated \u2013 a characterisation of the industry that is disputed by the unions, who argue that employers are trying to use modernisation as an excuse to reduce members\u2019 real pay and conditions. Shapps said: \u201cIf we can\u2019t get those modernisations in place we will have to impose those modernisations but we would much rather do it through these offers actually being put to their members.\u201d",

                "text": "Samantha Hawkins had a clear vision for her first home: the 29-year-old from Austin, Texas, wanted a detached house surrounded by a yard for her dog, a garden and a stable space where she could put down roots.\n\nBy January, when she bid $230,000 on a tiny, yardless condo converted from a rental studio, she had \u201cbent on a lot of the things I valued\u201d. She found herself beaten by investors willing to pay cash far above the listing price, and buy sight unseen in gameshow-like bidding wars.\n\nThe 496-sq-ft condo was one of the very few Austin homes she could still afford as prices soared in January. Her offer put her among the finalists, but at the last minute, the seller threw a new curveball: the other bidders had signed an appraisal waiver. Hawkins needed more cash she didn\u2019t have, so she \u201cbowed out\u201d.\n\nAcross the US, many have faced similar roadblocks: prices popped as a confluence of forces suppressed supply and inflated demand, leaving many middle- and lower-income buyers with a dwindling number of housing options, or forcing them into rentership.\n\nSamantha Hawkins at her apartment in Austin. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\nNow, with interest rates rising and the housing market cooling, things are supposed to be different. So far they aren\u2019t. Nationally, house prices hit an all-time high in June of $416,000, up 13.4% from a year ago.\n\nThe challenges Austin buyers are still experiencing show just how difficult the dream of owning your own home has become for a broad swath of Americans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked really hard the last year or two and made the right choices financially to try to have a chance, but it seems like I can\u2019t really win in this market,\u201d Hawkins said.\n\nThe problems plaguing tight markets nationally have all hit Austin. Hawkins is competing with investors who now account for more than 30% of single-family home sales, Airbnb operators and any number of the about 125 people moving to Austin daily amid dizzying job growth. Meanwhile, builders haven\u2019t kept pace with demand and zoning laws limit new multifamily housing that could provide relief.\n\nMay\u2019s median sale prices in Austin and surrounding Travis county hit new peaks of $676,000 and $625,000, respectively \u2013 up from around $400,000 just before the pandemic. That\u2019s put pressure on the rental market, pushing the median rent above $2,700 and fueling displacement.\n\nAnd even though Austin\u2019s June home inventory doubled over the prior year as interest rate hikes cooled demand, supply is only increasing for the wealthiest buyers.\n\nThe portion of national listings that someone earning $75,000 annually could afford dropped from 40% to 25% between January and June as home prices and mortgage rates climbed, National Association of Realtors\u2019 (NAR) data shows.\n\n\u201cThe higher inventory is promising, but not for middle- and lower-income groups,\u201d said Nadia Evangelou, an economist with NAR.\n\nThere\u2019s some evidence of that on the ground. Austin realtor Sherry LeBlanc, who focuses on finding homes for first-time buyers, recently listed a house that could have fetched $515,000 last year for $435,000 with the expectation that middle-income buyers would snap it up. Instead, showings were slow and only investors bid.\n\n\u201cFamilies are scared off by interest rates,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say, \u2018Well, shit, that\u2019s out of my budget.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor those like Hawkins stuck in rentership, the crisis hits on a financial level. Homeownership is a key instrument for wealth building and security, and loss of access to it represents a \u201cbreach of the social contract\u201d, said Austin realtor Socar Chatmon-Thomas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pissing me off because somebody who went to school, got a degree, or otherwise did everything right and now has a job making $60,000 can\u2019t buy a home,\u201d she said.\n\nInvestor demand\n\nEven with a six-figure tech salary, Courtney McKinley couldn\u2019t buy in the city. The parks, restaurants, pools and friends that attracted her to a rental in Austin\u2019s Zilker neighborhood were off the table as the lowest house prices had inched toward $1m.\n\nBut even as she looked around the city\u2019s edge and suburbs, she couldn\u2019t top the cash offers. A $350,000 bid on an over 40-year-old townhouse that \u201cneeded some help\u201d was beaten by an investor who offered $50,000 more in cash. Weeks later, she lost on a dilapidated townhome despite including a $50,000 escalation clause. The next month, an offer $30,000 over asking price on a sun-filled, three-bedroom home that felt perfect was turned down. \u201cThat was a heartbreak moment. I cried after that one,\u201d McKinley said.\n\nAfter more dead ends, she finally won with a $400,000 bid for a two-bedroom that needed a new kitchen, patio, floors and other improvements. It\u2019s in Pflugerville, a sprawling suburb of strip malls and big box stores that\u2019s in a \u201ckind of isolating\u201d location, McKinley said. Ultimately, however, she says she feels lucky: friends have put in up to 15 offers and still don\u2019t have a house.\n\nA new housing development under construction in Pflugerville, Texas. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\n\u201cIt was a rollercoaster, but no matter how difficult and frustrating it was, at least I\u2019m building equity now,\u201d she said.\n\nFor middle-class Austinites like McKinley being outbid by cash offers in Austin, this much feels clear: investors are part of the problem.\n\nWhile some argue the percentage of investor-owned single family purchases nationally remains low, tight \u201csun belt\u201d markets like metro Austin have seen it double from about 15% throughout the mid-2010s to over 30% in 2022\u2019s first quarter. And investors often target the type of homes that middle-income earners like McKinley are seeking, as well as those in lower-income, minority neighborhoods\n\n\u201cInvestors are not focused on the higher end of the market,\u201d said Georgia Tech urban planning professor Elora Lee Raymond. \u201cIt\u2019s entry-level homes that are being snapped up and are incredibly difficult to purchase at this time.\u201d\n\nBeyond having the resources to place higher bids and pay with cash, investors often buy homes sight unseen, and typically skip appraisals and inspections. Some companies also use algorithms to place bids within hours of homes being listed, and Wall Street-backed institutional investors are viewed as particularly problematic.\n\nThe five largest private equity buyers added 76,000 homes to their portfolio between March 2018 and September 2021, and their model has been derided by critics as \u201cindustrial housing\u201d as they maximize profits by raising rents and skimping on maintenance.\n\nA June US House committee investigation highlighting private equity\u2019s role in local housing crises noted corporate landlords in Atlanta were up to 205 times more likely to evict tenants, and increased rents by an average of 37-57% within a year of purchasing properties.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s virtually impossible to quantify how much investors are pushing up home prices, and the situation is a \u201cchicken and egg\u201d question, said Thom Malone, an economist for real estate data analyst CoreLogic.\n\nA new home, right, towers over residences on the same street in the Montopolis neighborhood in south-east Austin. Photograph: Jordan Vonderhaar/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n\u201cWhere investors go, prices go up, but to what extent is this because the prices were going up because demand increased?\u201d Malone asked. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a bit of both.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, another breed of investor is depleting stock in tourist-friendly areas: short-term rental operators. Though the city says Airbnb owners operate about 3,000 units, housing advocate Inside Airbnb gleaned the company\u2019s listings and found about 12,000, including 10,000 whole home units. And that accounts for one company \u2013 the true number of short-term rentals is probably much higher.\n\nIn one east Austin neighborhood, Airbnb in June controlled about 12% of the housing units, Inside Airbnb found. While about 270 units were available for long-term rent during a 2020 US census survey, more than 1,300 whole home units were available on Airbnb in June.\n\n\u201cEven without some economic researcher looking into it, common sense tells you that these are entire apartments that are no longer available, and people will be directly or indirectly displaced,\u201d said Inside Airbnb founder Murray Cox.\n\nShort supply\n\nThe signs of a construction boom are evident across Travis county, the fifth-most populous county in Texas. Along the metro region\u2019s edges, new neighborhoods and strip malls are multiplying, while closer to the city core in south Austin, expensive new condo buildings have sprouted among the old restaurants, strip malls and pawn shops on Congress Avenue.\n\nCars sit parked outside Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory on the east side of Austin. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\nThough Austin has grown at an exceptional clip for decades, the recent population spike is partly driven by tech: Oracle, Tesla, Meta, HP Enterprise and many more have relocated or opened offices here. That\u2019s coupled with demand from New York and California buyers who relocated during the pandemic, and millennials entering the market.\n\nMonthly new construction home closures in Austin in 2021 were up by 53% from pre-pandemic highs, CoreLogic data shows, but the city is struggling to build its way out of the crisis: supply chain squeezes and labor shortages observers pin on Trump\u2019s immigration policies have slowed the construction cycle.\n\n\u201cSupply is a tortoise and demand is a gazelle, so when there\u2019s a sudden increase in demand, it takes years for new supply to come on the market, and in the meantime there\u2019s this huge surge in prices,\u201d said Jake Wegmann, a University of Texas regional planning professor.\n\nA recent proposal to overhaul Austin\u2019s zoning ordinance would have allowed for more apartment buildings, increased the number of townhomes and simplified the approval process. The changes would allow the city to build \u201cthousands more units\u201d annually, but Nimby-ism and anti-growth forces shut it down, Wegmann said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to make it sound like this would\u2019ve solved everything, but we\u2019re really tying our own hand behind our back,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2018I pray every night\u2019\n\nPaola Valdez-Lopez cleans while her kids, Alycia, five, and Matias, six, eat dinner in Austin. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\nSoaring home prices ultimately create pressure lower in the market, hitting the city\u2019s most vulnerable the hardest. Six months ago, Paola Valdez and her husband made the last $500 payment on their three-bedroom trailer set in a south Austin mobile home park. The extra money was welcome as the couple raised two young kids, and they were proud to own the home outright.\n\nBut everything changed in early July. The California investor who recently purchased the Congress Mobile Home Park handed 60-day eviction notices to its residents, and leaving isn\u2019t easy \u2013 Valdez\u2019s trailer can\u2019t be transported because it\u2019s 30 years old.\n\nA new, smaller trailer is $1,500 a month plus the lot fee, and three-bedroom apartments in her neighborhood top $3,500 a month. The family is at a loss over what it will do next, but Valdez expects her days of staying home to raise the kids are done.\n\n\u201cOne day you\u2019re fine, you\u2019ve paid off your home and you\u2019re making a nest, then all the sudden you\u2019re bombarded with \u2018You\u2019ve got to leave in 60 days\u2019,\u201d Valdez said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to stay strong. I pray every night.\u201d\n\nLeft: A notice of non-renewal of lease for Paola Valdez-Lopez. Right: Edvin Agular embraces his wife, Valdez-Lopez. Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian\n\nAs median rent jumped 48% year over year, state records analyzed by the Guardian data show Travis County evictions hit record monthly highs in March and April. That\u2019s partially fueled by investors purchasing apartment buildings with affordable rents and turning them into pricey condos, said Mincho Jacob, a spokesperson with housing advocate Basta Austin.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s destroying the heart of Austin because people with long roots here are evicted and forced out,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are few tools to do anything about it in Texas where the Republican-controlled legislature largely banned rent control, and though housing advocates have had some success in warding off developer purchases of affordable housing, it hasn\u2019t been enough. Similarly, wide-scale displacement continues even though Austin voters since 2018 have approved $550m for affordable housing and anti-displacement measures.\n\nAnother link between the higher home prices and rental pressure is those like Hawkins, who have been shut out of ownership. But with a recent salary increase in her career, she\u2019s regrouping and saving money, and says she\u2019s determined as ever to own.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a goal of mine for a really long time, and since there\u2019s been so many failed attempts, I just want to prove to myself that I can do it,\u201d she said.",

                "text": "A high street decorated with British Union Jack bunting in Penistone, UK. The End Fuel Poverty Coalition has warned \"a tsunami of fuel poverty will hit the country this winter.\" Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nLONDON \u2014 Facing soaring energy bills, rising costs and rapidly declining consumer purchasing power, small businesses across the U.K. are struggling to make ends meet. New data on Wednesday showed U.K. inflation jumped to a 40-year high of 10.1% in July as food and energy costs continued to soar, exacerbating the country's cost-of-living crisis. The Bank of England expects consumer price inflation to top out at 13.3% in October, with the country's average energy bills (set via a price cap) expected to rise sharply in the fourth quarter to eventually exceed an annual \u00a34,266 ($5,170) in early 2023. On Wednesday, a director of U.K. energy regulator Ofgem quit over its decision to add hundreds of pounds to household bills, accusing the watchdog of failing to strike the \"right balance between the interests of consumers and the interests of suppliers.\" Real wages in the U.K. fell by an annual 3% in the second quarter of 2022, the sharpest decline on record, as wage increases failed to keep pace with the surging cost of living. A new survey published Friday also showed consumer confidence falling to its lowest level since records began in 1974. 'Absolute madness' \"While the energy price caps do not apply to businesses directly, millions of small business owners are still experiencing increased energy bills at a time when costs are rising in most operational areas,\" said Alan Thomas, U.K. CEO at insurance firm Simply Business. \"Simultaneously, consumer purchasing power is going down as Brits cut back on non-essential spending, harming the books of SME [small and medium-sized enterprise] owners.\" This assessment was echoed by Christopher Gammon, e-commerce manager at Lincs Aquatics \u2014 a Lincolnshire-based store and warehouse providing aquariums, ponds and marine livestock. The business has seen its energy costs rise by 90% so far since the war in Ukraine began, Gammon told CNBC on Thursday, and its owners are provisioning for further increases in the coming months.\n\n\"We are combating the rising cost with switching everything to LED, solar panels, wind turbines (planning in process) and closing down unused systems,\" Gammon said. \"We have also had to increase the price of products \u2014 most of these have been livestock as they are now costing more to look after.\" Customers are increasingly withdrawing from keeping fish and reptiles due to the cost of maintenance, and on Wednesday the store had a customer bring in a snake they could no longer afford to care for. The spiraling costs forced Lincs Aquatics to close a store in East Yorkshire, laying off several workers, while trying to offer pay rises to staff at its two remaining locations in Lincolnshire in order to help them through the crisis. The business is also working to expand its online shop due to rising in-store upkeep costs, as heating water for marine aquariums and purchasing pump equipment become ever more expensive. In early July, a quarterly survey from the British Chambers of Commerce found that 82% of businesses in the U.K. saw inflation as a growing concern for their business, with growth in sales, investment intentions and longer-term turnover confidence all slowing.\n\n\"Businesses face an unprecedented convergence of cost pressures, with the main drivers coming from raw materials, fuel, utilities, taxes, and labor,\" said BCC Head of Research David Bharier. \"The continuing supply chain crisis, exacerbated by conflict in Ukraine and lockdowns in China, has further compounded this.\" BCC Director General Shevaun Haviland added that \"the red lights on our economic dashboard are starting to flash,\" with almost every indicator deteriorating since the March survey. Phil Speed, an independent distributor for multiservice company Utility Warehouse, based in Skegness, England, liaises with brokers to find energy deals for business clients. He told CNBC earlier this week that for the first time in 10 years, he had been unable to obtain a better deal for a client than their out-of-contract rate \u2014 the typically expensive rates paid when a business or individual does not have a contracted deal in place. \"I think the unit rate she was quoting was 60p [pence] a unit for gas, which is just ridiculous. I'd imagine a year ago, we'd have been looking at 5 or 6p. It's just absolute madness,\" Speed said. \"We've got no idea what's going to be presented to us, because we've got no idea what's going to happen. The price is just going ballistic. No-one's going to buy it.\" The cost of gas for both businesses and consumers are only expected to increase through the colder winter months. Speed noted that local cafes cooking on gas will likely struggle, as they have no choice but to continue using it, unless they can replace gas appliances with electric ones. 'Scream very loudly at somebody' Rail strikes have already brought the country to a halt on multiple days throughout the summer and look set to continue, while postal workers, telecoms engineers and dock workers have all voted to strike as inflation erodes real wages. Conservative leadership favorite Liz Truss was earlier this month forced into a dramatic U-turn on a plan to cut public sector pay outside London, which would have axed wages for teachers, nurses, police and the armed forces alike. Local authorities recently offered state school support staff a flat pay rise of \u00a31,925 per year, meaning a 10.5% increase for the lowest-paid staff and just over 4% for the highest earners, after pressure from three of the country's largest unions. One woman in her early fifties \u2013 a member of support staff at a state school in Lincolnshire who asked not to be named due to the sensitive situation and concerns on public reprisals \u2013 told CNBC that years of real-terms pay cuts had left many low-paid public sector workers struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe British government in 2010, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, announced a two-year pay freeze for public sector workers, followed by a 1% average cap on public sector pay awards which was lifted in 2017, with average pay rises increasing to roughly 2% by 2020. While the 10.5% rise for the lowest-paid school support staff will ease the pressure, the woman said her energy costs had doubled and her private landlord had attempted to increase her rent by \u00a340 per month, which she had not agreed to and which may mean she would need to sell her car to cover basic living expenses. She called on the government to temporarily reduce the \"standing charge,\" a fixed daily amount households have to pay on most gas and electricity bills no matter how much they actually use, and to up its efforts to recoup one-off \"windfall taxes\" from energy companies such as BP, Shell and Centrica, which are reporting record profits.. \"I think this is an even bigger crisis than [the Covid-19 pandemic], because this is going to affect not just lower earners, but maybe even middle earners as well, because I don't see how anybody can absorb those kinds of energy costs,\" she said.",

                "text": "Check out the companies making the biggest moves midday:\n\nCisco Systems \u2014 Shares of the networking equipment producer jumped 5.8%. The company reported earnings after the bell on Wednesday that beat estimates. Cisco also provided a better-than-expected forecast for 2023.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond \u2014 The latest favored meme stock, which has surged in August, dropped almost 20%. Investors appeared to be reacting to activist investor Ryan Cohen's filing that he intends to sell his entire stake in the company.\n\nKohl's \u2014 Kohl's shares sank more than 7% after the retailer slashed its financial forecast for the year, citing inflation pressures on middle-income customers. The company expects net sales in fiscal 2022 down 5% to 6%, down from a prior range of flat to up 1%. However, Kohl's beat analysts' expectations for fiscal second-quarter profit and revenue.\n\nBJ's Wholesale \u2014 Shares of the club retailer popped more than 7% on Thursday after BJ's reported better-than-expected results for the second quarter. The company generated $1.06 in adjusted earnings per share on $5.01 billion of revenue. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting 80 cents per share on $4.67 billion of revenue. The company's comparable sales rose 7.6% year over year, excluding gasoline. BJ's was also upgraded by Bank of America to a buy from neutral.\n\nElanco Animal Health \u2014 Shares of Elanco shed more than 4% after the company was downgraded by Morgan Stanley. The firm shifted the stock to equal weight from overweight citing concerns about future profits.\n\nVerizon \u2014 Shares of Verizon slipped 2.54% after MoffettNathanson downgraded it to underperform and slashed its price target. Increased competition from AT&T and T-Mobile is weighing on Verizon and will likely drag shares lower, analysts said.\n\nCanadian Solar \u2014 The solar equipment and services company hit a new 52-week high, popping more than 15%, after reporting quarterly profits that beat expectations. Canadian Solar also raised its full-year revenue forecast and reported solar module shipments that were at the high end of its forecast.\n\nWolfspeed \u2014 Shares surged more than 31% after the semiconductor company surpassed expectations in its most recent earnings report. Wolfspeed CEO Gregg Lowe said he remains \"very encouraged about the industry's prospects for future growth and the activity we are seeing across our end-markets.\"\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance \u2014 Shares of Walgreens fell more than 5% in trading Thursday. The drugstore chain, along with CVS and Walmart, was ordered Wednesday by a federal judge to pay a combined $650.6 million to two Ohio counties to address damage done by the opioid crisis. Walgreens also announced Wednesday it had sold 11 million shares of Option Care Health's common stock in an underwritten secondary offering.\n\nEnergy stocks \u2014 Energy stocks were buoyed by the rise in oil prices, with shares of Devon Energy and Halliburton rising more than 5%, and APA adding more than 8%. Exxon Mobil gained more than 2% and Occidental Petroleum rallied 3%..\n\n\u2014CNBC's Jesse Pound, Carmen Reinicke and Sarah Min contributed reporting.",

                "text": "Consumer confidence in the UK is weaker than during the four major recessions of the past half century as rapidly rising inflation saps morale.\n\nAlthough the UK is technically yet to enter recession, the latest barometer of sentiment from the data company GfK found the public gloomier than at any time since the survey began in January 1974.\n\nThe monthly look at confidence found the relatively upbeat mood as Britain emerged from lockdown in 2021 had been replaced by deepening pessimism as the annual increase in the cost of living has climbed to a 40-year high of 10.1%.\n\nIn grim news for businesses that rely on consumer spending, the public mood is now more downbeat than it was during the recessions of the mid-1970s, the early 1980s, the early 1990s and the late 2000s.\n\nThe period covered by the survey also covers the three-day week of 1974, the sterling crisis of 1976, and the pound\u2019s ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992 \u2013 none of which was marked by such a bleak public mood.\n\nSentiment has been falling steadily throughout 2022 and dropped by a further three points to a record low of -44 in August. A year ago the index stood at -8.\n\nConsumers are pessimistic about the outlook for their own finances in the year ahead (-31) as a further sharp increase in the energy price cap looms in October, but even more pessimistic (-60) about the prospects for the economy.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our sub-measure on the general economy over the past year has decreased month-on-month since December 2021.\u201d\n\nStaton said there had been a similar consistent marked decline since the end of last year in how consumers viewed the economy, with the August score of -60 a new record.\n\n\u201cThese findings point to a sense of capitulation, of financial events moving far beyond the control of ordinary people. With headline after headline revealing record inflation eroding household buying power, the strain on the personal finances of many in the UK is alarming. Just making ends meet has become a nightmare and the crisis of confidence will only worsen with the darkening days of autumn and the colder months of winter.\u201d\n\nThe latest flash estimates of consumer spending released on Thursday by the Office for National Statistics showed restaurant numbers did not change in the week to 14 August, while payments by credit and debit cards decreased by seven percentage points.\n\nLinda Ellett, UK head of consumer markets, retail and leisure at KPMG, said: \u201cStorm clouds are now fast closing in, with higher costs reducing the discretionary spending power of even more households this autumn and winter.\n\n\u201cSo far this year, retail sales have somewhat defied the very low levels of consumer confidence. But a widespread reduction in spending ability will lead to drops in demand and changing buying behaviour, both of which will impact the high street and wider economy.\u201d",

                "text": "That\u2019s because a less-intense version of the rent surge that is pushing inflation higher across cities in the American south is beginning to play out in bigger cities in the Northeast and on the West Coast. Real-time market rent trackers that reported prices shooting up in Sun Belt cities last year are now showing bigger increases in places like New York, San Jose and Seattle.\n\nInflation F.A.Q. Card 1 of 5 Inflation F.A.Q. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. Inflation F.A.Q. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Inflation F.A.Q. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. Inflation F.A.Q. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Inflation F.A.Q. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose market rent increases take time to trickle into official inflation figures because of the way the government calculates its data. Much as Phoenix\u2019s official inflation numbers are surging now partly because of the run-up in market rents in 2021, nascent increases in big coastal cities could keep pressure on inflation in months to come. And the effect could be palpable at a national level: New York and its suburbs account for about 11 percent of the nation\u2019s rental housing-related costs in the Consumer Price Index, compared to about 1 percent for Phoenix.\n\n\u201cEven if we get a slowdown in the Sun Belt, it may not be enough to offset what we\u2019re seeing in other markets,\u201d said Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights.\n\nFederal Reserve officials noted that risk at their July meeting, according to minutes released Wednesday, observing that \u201cin some product categories, the rate of price increase could well pick up further in the short run, with sizable additional increases in residential rental expenses being especially likely.\u201d\n\nThe Fed has been raising interest rates since March to try to slow consumer and business demand and cool inflation and is expected to lift them again at its meeting in September.\n\nTo date, much of the regional divide in price increases \u2014 from rents to consumer goods and services \u2014 has traced back to migration. People have been flocking to less expensive cities from big coastal ones for years, but that trend accelerated sharply with the onset of the pandemic. The pattern is playing out across both the Mountain West, where inflation is also remarkably high, and the Sun Belt.",

That was an improvement over July's minus-12.3.\n\nThe level was above the estimate for a minus-5 and helped quell fears that manufacturing might be headed for a major slowdown. A similar survey on Monday from the New York Fed fell a stunning 40 points as respondents indicated that business conditions were deteriorating.\n\nThe indexes for prices paid and received both declined on the month, though they remain well into territory that indicates inflation is still present.

                "text": "(Click here to subscribe to the Delivering Alpha newsletter.)\n\nWhen Peter Kraus founded Aperture Investors, he deviated from the traditional active management model. Rather than raking in fixed fees, Kraus' $3.8 billion firm operates on a fee structure linked to performance, charging 30 percent of alpha. That's higher than the industry standard but since inception, about half of Aperture's funds have delivered alpha above their benchmarks. Kraus sat down with CNBC's Delivering Alpha newsletter to explain why he's focused on a pay-for-performance set-up and how he's putting capital to work in the current environment.\n\n(The below has been edited for length and clarity. See above for full video.)\n\nLeslie Picker: What do you see as the key problem with the traditional model? And what do you think is the best way to fix it?\n\nPeter Kraus: The key problem is very simple. The existing model in almost all cases, rewards people whether or not they perform. So, it's a fixed fee and as assets grow, you earn more money. Well, clients don't actually hire us to grow our assets, they hire us to perform. So, you would think the performance fee or the actual fee would be connected to the performance as opposed to the asset growth. We also know that asset growth is the enemy of performance. It's harder and harder to perform, the more assets that you manage. So, the fee doesn't help you - that traditional fee doesn't help in that regard, because the manager is incentivized to continue to grow assets, and that makes it harder and harder to perform.\n\nOf course, there are performance fees in the marketplace and hedge funds and private equity, but they also have rather large management fees. So, they too have some incentive to grow their assets. Basically Aperture is the anathema to that - it's the opposite. We charge a very low base fee that's equal to the ETF and then we only charge if we beat the index. So, you pay for performance. If we don't have any performance, you pay what you pay to buy the ETF.\n\nPicker: So, then how do you choose which index is relevant for the specific strategies?. I mean, do you invest in certain ways that would mirror or would be comparable to certain indexes that you're able to then outperform?\n\nKraus: Exactly. So, we're very, very thoughtful about the index because we're actually charging people to beat the index. So, for example, in global equities, we would use the MSCI global equity index. For U.S. small cap, we would use the Russell 2000. For European equities, we would use the Euro Stoxx Index. Very simple indices, not complex, no real question about whether the manager is actually creating a portfolio that is following that index. In fact, we actually test the correlation of the portfolio to the index to make sure the index continues to be relevant.\n\nPicker: People who advocate for their management fee will say that it's necessary, essentially, to keep the lights on - that it basically ensures that the operations of the fund can meet all of their fixed costs and cover their expenses. How are you able to do so with a lower management fee?\n\nKraus: People say, well, I need to keep the lights on. Well, okay, how many assets do you need to keep the lights on? And once you have the lights on, then do you need to keep charging the fixed fee? Because your incentive is just to continue to gather assets. So, it's really a function of how many assets we have and we've created a company where we think that assets scale pretty much speaks for revenues to cover the fixed expenses. And then the rest is only earned if we perform. One of the things that I like about Aperture is that I'm incentivized, as the owner of the business identically with the client. I don't make much money, if any money, unless we actually perform.\n\nPicker: What about your ability to recruit and pay employees? Does it have any bearing on compensation?\n\nKraus: Sure does. The portfolio managers are paid a strict percentage of the performance fee. So, portfolio managers are usually paid 35% of the 30% that we charge. We charge a 30% performance fee and we pay the management, to the portfolio managers and their team, 35% of that. And we've selected that percentage because we think that that is highly competitive with both the hedge fund industry as well as the long-only industry. And if managers perform on the amount of capital that they have, their compensation can be quite attractive. And that's, in effect, how we believe we can attract some of the best talent in the marketplace.\n\nPicker: It doesn't appear though, at least in the current environment, that LPs are too dissuaded by the traditional model. I mean, there were nearly 200 hedge fund launches in Q1 outpacing the number of liquidations. AUM stands around $4 trillion for the hedge fund industry overall. So, it doesn't appear that LPS have really been pushing back, at least in terms of new launches and total AUM size. So, I'm just curious kind of what your conversations have been like on that front?\n\nKraus: Well, there's $4 trillion in the hedge fund community but there's $32 trillion in the long-only community. And I don't think that it's a question that is hard to answer. If you look at the trend between the active management industry and the passive industry, money's been moving to the passive industry at a rapid pace - unchanged for 10 years. And the hedge fund space, the $4 trillion - we're talking about all sorts of different types of hedge funds, for sure, it's not a monolithic industry. But essentially, most managers or most allocators that I speak to would rather not pay a performance fee times the beta that their money is exposed to. They would like to pay a performance fee for actually the performance. And so, we offer that clarity, which many hedge funds do not. And in the long-only space, there's virtually no payment for performance. It's almost all fixed.\n\nPicker: Since there's so much on the line with regard to performance, I have to ask you, what's your strategy? What's your what's your thinking right now? How are you putting capital to work in the current environment in a way that you believe will outperform the benchmarks?\n\nKraus: It depends upon the strategy, whether it's an equity strategy or fixed income strategy. But in the equity strategies, we are what you would expect - highly research dependent, looking for specific opportunities with companies that we think have long term growth, or undervalue and will accelerate their value over time. And that timeframe is usually 18 months to three years. In the credit space, again, it's fundamental research to find credits and obviously being careful about the market because credit markets tend to be more macro driven. But it's all of the above and that's what we spend our time doing. We think that if we do that consistently over time, we can perform.\n\nPicker: Are you net long or net short in the current environment?\n\nKraus: Interestingly enough, in the one hedge fund that we do run, we're pretty close to flat. So, I would say a very low net position. In the other funds that we run, we run 100% long. So, in other words, we are what I call beta one, exposed to the index by 100%. But we do have shorts, so we're gross more than 100% in those funds. But I would say in general, right now, our risk positions are low.\n\nPicker: So, not much leverage then?\n\nKraus: Not much leverage, but more importantly, the actual stocks and bonds that we are choosing and the positions we're taking, we're on, I would say, the low end of our risk scale.",

                "text": "A year ago, buying a Starbucks coffee didn\u2019t feel \u201creal\u201d to Samantha Thomas. \u201cIt was just tapping,\u201d the 41-year-old private tutor from Wigan says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like real money, it was just my card.\u201d Nowadays, Thomas pulls out a \u00a35 note every time she wants a hot drink. \u201cWhen you\u2019re physically handing over solid money,\u201d she says, \u201cit just makes you think twice.\u201d\n\nFor the last 12 months, Thomas has been a cash-only consumer. She leaves her debit card at home when she does her weekly food shop, bringing only the budget she has allocated in notes. As a result, Thomas could \u201csit here and tell you to the penny\u201d what most items in the supermarket cost. \u201cI know that if I go to Aldi something would cost me 6p less than if I went to Asda and about 5p less than if I went to Tesco,\u201d she says. Thomas\u2019s \u201csolid money\u201d habit hasn\u2019t just changed her attitude to Starbucks; it\u2019s changed the way she spends and saves entirely.\n\nResearch shows that we experience the \u2018pain of paying\u2019 when spending cash. Photograph: georgeclerk/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nThomas is not the only one turning to cash during the cost of living crisis. In July, more than \u00a3800m in banknotes was withdrawn from Post Office counters, a 20% rise from the same month the year before. Martin Kearsley, banking director at the Post Office, told the BBC: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more people increasingly reliant on cash as the tried-and-tested way to manage a budget.\u201d\n\nSince records began five years ago, Post Office withdrawals have exceeded \u00a3800m only once before \u2013 and that was last Christmas, a time when a lot of cash is tucked into cards. Shortly after UK wages fell at their fastest rate in 20 years, Kearsley said it was clear that Britain is \u201canything but a cashless society\u201d.\n\nThomas first ditched her debit card post-lockdown after she was troubled by her online spending during the pandemic, but she says her cash-only budget is helping her to prepare for rising costs. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m ahead of the game, I feel like I\u2019ve got an advantage,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be tricky, but I feel like I\u2019ve already got lots of tools in place to help me.\u201d\n\nContactless promotes increased spending and increased use of debt Warwick business school\n\nPersonal finance and consumer expert Sue Hayward concurs that \u201chanding over cold hard cash often makes you think twice about how much you\u2019re spending\u201d. She also notes that it\u2019s easier to keep track of purchases when paying with banknotes, \u201cas contactless payments can take several days to show up on your statement\u201d.\n\nIn 2020, researchers from Warwick business school analysed more than 300m transactions from 260,000 consumers and found that people with contactless cards spent \u201csignificantly more\u201d than those without. Contactless spenders were also more likely to be charged overdraft fees and made more purchases overall. The researchers concluded that contactless: \u201cpromotes increased spending and can promote decreased cash usage and increased use of debt.\u201d\n\nConversely, almost 30 years of academic research have shown that we experience the \u201cpain of paying\u201d when spending cash: handing over money feels like losing it, activating the insular cortex, the part of our brain that deals with physical pain. (Interestingly, it seems that some alternatives to cash are less painful than others. One 2018 paper, from the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, found that consumers feel lower levels of pain when they pay with mobile phones and smartwatches than when they use credit cards.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just being savvy and going back to old-school ways,\u201d Thomas says of her cash use. On her YouTube channel, The Budget Mum UK, she shows her 2,600 subscribers how she withdraws her wage at the start of the month and separates the notes into different laminated envelopes. Among others, there\u2019s an envelope for food shopping, one for travel, one for credit card debt and one for emergencies.\n\nOld-style budgeting \u2026 \u2018cash stuffing\u2019 involves setting aside money in envelopes, one for each expense. Photograph: FotoDuets/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nOn social media, this budgeting technique is called \u201ccash stuffing\u201d: the envelopes help people keep track of their spending and saving without complicated spreadsheets. Google searches for the technique spiked at the beginning of the year, and TikTok videos hashtagged #cashstuffing have now accumulated almost 550m views.\n\nJade Edmondson is a 29-year-old teaching assistant from Coventry who sells cash-stuffing materials such as labelled plastic envelopes, binders and savings tracking sheets on her Etsy page. She says she has seen a recent rise in sales. In total, Edmondson personally uses 30 cash-stuffing envelopes for things such as petrol money, Christmas savings and her Slimming World membership. Putting away money gradually in one envelope over the course of the year helps Edmondson save for bigger costs: she now has \u00a3350 saved to buy her four children\u2019s school uniforms. \u201cIf this was me last year, I would be panicking: \u2018How am I going to pay for all of this?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cWhereas actually now, I don\u2019t worry about money.\u201d\n\nYet a cash-only lifestyle can cause problems in an increasingly cashless society. In 2010, half of the UK\u2019s transactional payments were made in cash, but by 2020, this had dropped to just 17%. A number of shops banned cash payments for public health reasons during the pandemic, but a 2021 survey by Which? found that one in five consumers had been prevented from making a cash payment between April and July of 2021, when restrictions were easing.\n\nThe reality is you will pay more using cash because you can\u2019t shop online Natalie Cenney\n\nThomas has run into trouble when paying for petrol \u2013 and when she sent her daughter to the cinema with cash recently, she was unable to buy her ticket and snacks. \u201cIt\u2019s just been trial and error,\u201d she says. Six weeks ago, she decided to set up Apple Pay on her phone as a backup for emergencies, but she refuses to leave her credit card in her car to avoid temptation.\n\nNatalie Ceeney, chair of the Cash Action Group, says many small businesses don\u2019t accept cash because it\u2019s increasingly difficult to deposit takings due to the closure of high street banks. Ceeney is now campaigning to get ATMs to take cash deposits (you can currently do this inside banks, but opening hours can be prohibitive). However, she says, \u201csetting up a whole new network\u201d is \u201cnot quick\u201d. Meanwhile, Ceeney notes that many consumers depend on cash due to \u201csome form of vulnerability\u201d, such as not having a proper internet connection, smartphone or bank account, or having a disability. A May study by the Royal Society of Arts found that 15 million people in the UK rely on cash to budget.\n\n\u201cThe main reason people will tell you they use cash is for budgeting: you can see it, you can feel it,\u201d Ceeney says. \u201cWith the cost of living crisis, more people are strapped for cash so it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that people are going back to using cash, withdrawing money to get through the week safely without getting overdrawn.\u201d\n\nAlthough cash can have its advantages, Ceeney warns that there\u2019s a \u201cpoverty premium\u201d when avoiding cards. \u201cThe reality is, if you can\u2019t shop online you will pay more using cash because you can\u2019t get online deals or direct debits where you often get a discount, you can\u2019t shop around or buy in bulk,\u201d she says. Ceeney explains that although many families know this, they\u2019re \u201cgoing back to cash because they can\u2019t afford to go overdrawn \u2013 this is about necessity\u201d.\n\nEven with cash-stuffing systems in place, Thomas and Edmondson are concerned about the ever-increasing cost of living. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s going to be a big hurdle,\u201d Thomas says of rising bills, while Edmondson adds: \u201cIt\u2019s still very nerve-racking. It\u2019s like: \u2018Where are we going to find this extra money from?\u2019\u201d While using cash can be helpful for individual consumers, it is not a substitute for government intervention, nor a long-term solution to our economic crisis. With food prices rising at their fastest pace in 14 years and annual energy bills expected to cost two months\u2019 worth of wages next year, coins can only go so far.\n\nAdditional reporting by Rachel Hall",

                "text": "Retail activity was flat in July as falling fuel prices held back gas station sales and consumers turned more heavily to online shopping, the Census Bureau reported Wednesday.\n\nWhile advance retail sales were unchanged, total receipts excluding autos rose 0.4%. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a 0.1% increase in the top-line number and a flat total ex-autos. June's gain was revised down to 0.8% from 1%.\n\nRetail and food sales excluding gasoline and autos rose 0.7% from a month ago.\n\nThe numbers are adjusted seasonally but not for inflation, and come during a month when the consumer price index also was flat.\n\nA tumble in fuel prices off their record nominal highs pushed down sales at the pump, with gas station receipts off 1.8%. Motor vehicle and parts dealers sales also fell sharply, declining 1.6%.\n\nGas prices had eclipsed $5 a gallon in many locations earlier in the summer, but fell through July and most recently were at $3.94 a gallon for regular unleaded, according to AAA.\n\n\"People appear to have used some of the savings from lower gas prices to spend more on other items, both in nominal and \u2014 very likely \u2014 real terms,\" wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \"Auto sales have been severely constrained by the chip shortage, so pent-up demand likely is substantial. July's other losers were department stores and clothing retailers, but all these components are noisy and subject to revisions.\"\n\nThose pullbacks in gas and auto sales were offset by a 2.7% increase in online sales and a 1.5% gain in miscellaneous stores.\n\nConsumers have been fighting to keep up with an inflationary environment that has seen prices overall increase 8.5% from a year ago, close to the highest level in 40 years. Price rises have been especially pernicious in the food and energy category; even with the July slide in energy prices, gas station receipts climbed 39.9% from a year ago.\n\nJuly provided some respite from inflation pressures, and the decline in fuel costs particularly allowed consumers to spend elsewhere.\n\nFood sales rose just 0.2%, however, even as the food price index as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics increased 1.1% for the month. Sales at bars and restaurants also struggled, rising just 0.1%.\n\nSome retailers also have struggled in the current environment.\n\nTarget on Wednesday said its earnings tumbled close to 90% from a year ago as it has had to mark down prices on unwanted inventory.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been using interest rate increases to hold back inflation. The central bank enacted consecutive 0.75 percentage point hikes in June and July and is expected to keep moving rates higher until inflation comes down to the Fed's 2% goal.\n\nCorrection: Target on Wednesday said its earnings tumbled close to 90% from a year ago. An earlier version misstated the metric.",

Sunak has said he would cut taxes but only when inflation is back under control.\n\nBut the IFS said in the next financial year \u2013 2023\u201324 \u2013 borrowing was likely to increase by \u00a323bn, because the government would need to uprate benefits and pensions in line with a higher inflation rate at a cost of \u00a34bn and also pay \u00a354bn in higher debt interest on inflation-linked bonds. The spending increases would only be partly offset by a \u00a334bn increase in tax revenues as a result of rising inflation.\n\nThe thinktank said there would be additional pressures, probably running into tens of billions of pounds, to continue to support households struggling with higher energy bills and to compensate public services for the impact of higher than expected inflation.\n\nIn a new report published today, the IFS said Truss and Sunak needed to recognise the even greater than usual uncertainty in the public finances. Pressures on public services would be more acute, higher spending than planned looked \u201cinevitable\u201d and tax revenues would depend on the length and depth of the recession being forecast by Threadneedle Street.\n\nThe thinktank said additional public borrowing in the short term was not necessarily a problem \u2013 and might be appropriate to fund targeted support, but large permanent tax cuts on the scale being mooted during the Tory party\u2019s hustings would exacerbate \u201calready substantial pressures\u201d on the public finances unless matching spending cuts were also implemented. In reality, \u201csignificant\u201d spending increases were likely to be needed in face of high inflation, it added.\n\nCarl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS and an author of the report, said: \u201cThe reality is that the UK has got poorer over the last year. That makes tax and spending decisions all the more difficult. It is hard to square the promises that both Ms Truss and Mr Sunak are making to cut taxes over the medium-term with the absence of any specific measures to cut public spending and a presumed desire to manage the nation\u2019s finances responsibly.\u201d\n\nSunak\u2019s campaign responded saying the IFS analysis \u201cdrives a coach and horses\u201d through his rival\u2019s proposals, and that he has \u201cconsistently made the case that permanent, unfunded tax cuts would cause significant damage to the public finances and push inflation up higher\u201d.\n\nThe Bank of England expects inflation to fall sharply next year after peaking at more than 13% in October.",

Kent Nishimura | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Reserve's path to bringing down runaway inflation while keeping the economy from slipping into a major downturn is still open but is getting narrower, according to Goldman Sachs. As the central bank looks to keep raising interest rates, the economy is teeming with mixed signals: rapidly rising payroll figures against sharply declining housing numbers, falling gasoline prices vs. surging shelter and food costs, and low consumer sentiment against steady spending numbers. Amid it all, the Fed is trying to strike a balance between slowing things down, but not by too much. On that score, Goldman economists think there have been clear wins, some losses and a landscape ahead that poses substantial challenges. \"Our broad conclusion is that there is a feasible but difficult path to a soft landing, though several factors beyond the Fed's control can ease or complicate that path and raise or lower the odds of success,\" Goldman economist David Mericle said in a client note Sunday.\n\nSlow growth, high inflation\n\nOne of the biggest inflation drivers has been outsized growth that has created imbalances between supply and demand. The Fed is using interest rate increases to try to damp down demand so supply can catch up, and supply chain pressures, as measured by a New York Fed index, are at their lowest since January 2021. So on that score, Mericle said the Fed's efforts have \"gone well.\" He said the rate increases \u2014 totaling 2.25 percentage points since March \u2014 have \"achieved a much-need deceleration\" regarding growth and specifically demand. In fact, Goldman expects GDP to grow at just a 1% pace over the next four quarters, and that's coming off consecutive declines of 1.6% and 0.9%. Though most economists expect that the National Bureau of Economic Research will not declare the U.S. in recession for the first half of the year, the slow-growth path makes the Fed's balancing act more difficult. On a similar count, Mericle said the Fed's moves have helped narrow the supply-demand gap in the labor market, where there are still nearly two job openings for every available worker. That effort \"has a long way to go,\" he wrote. However, the biggest problem remains stubbornly high inflation. The consumer price index was flat in July but still rose 8.5% from a year ago. Wages are surging at a strong clip, with average hourly earnings up 5.2% from a year ago. Consequently, the Fed's efforts to halt a spiral in which higher prices feed higher wages and perpetuate inflation have \"shown little convincing progress so far,\" Mericle said. \"The bad news is that high inflation is broad-based, measures of the underlying trend are elevated, and business inflation expectations and pricing intentions remain high,\" he added.\n\nDoubts about the Fed's policy path\n\nFighting inflation might require higher rate hikes than the market currently anticipates. Goldman's projection is that the Fed raises benchmark rates by another percentage point before the end of the year, but Mericle acknowledged that there is \"upside risk\" due to \"the recent easing in financial conditions, the robust pace of hiring, and signs of stickiness in wage growth and inflation.\" Indeed, former New York Fed President William Dudley said Monday he thinks the market is underestimating the future path of rate hikes and, consequently, the risks of a hard landing or recession.",

Kohl's most recent quarter beat Street forecasts for revenue and profit.\n\nBJ's Wholesale (BJ) \u2013 The warehouse retailer beat estimates by 26 cents with an adjusted quarterly profit of $1.06 per share and revenue also topped forecasts. Comparable store sales increased more than expected, and the stock rallied 5.4% in premarket trading.\n\nTapestry (TPR) \u2013 Tapestry moved between gains and losses in premarket action after its earnings came in above consensus despite sales that were slightly short of forecasts. The company behind luxury brands Coach and Kate Spade also raised its quarterly dividend by 20%.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) \u2013 Estee Lauder shares fell 1.3% in the premarket after the cosmetics maker forecast full-year sales below consensus, due to Covid-related lockdowns in China. Estee Lauder's profit and revenue for its most recent quarter beat Wall Street estimates.\n\nCanadian Solar (CSIQ) \u2013 The solar equipment and services company reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and solar module shipments that were at the high end of its prior forecast. Canadian Solar also raised its full-year revenue forecast, and its stock jumped 6.2% in premarket trading.\n\nBath & Body Works (BBWI) \u2013 Bath & Body Works reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, but gave a current-quarter forecast that was weaker than expected.

The networking equipment maker also gave a stronger-than-expected outlook for the current quarter as supply chain issues ease.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) \u2013 Bed Bath & Beyond tumbled 14.4% in the premarket after investor Ryan Cohen filed a notice of intent to sell 7.78 million shares of the housewares retailer. Cohen's prior purchases of call options had contributed to a buying spree in Bed Bath & Beyond, with the stock up in 15 of the past 16 sessions and increasing more than five-fold in value over that time.\n\nWolfspeed (WOLF) \u2013 Wolfspeed rocketed higher by 20.9% in the premarket after the semiconductor company reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss and revenue that beat consensus estimates.

                "text": "The news this week that inflation has hit a 40-year high even as wages fall at their fastest rate in two decades is sobering, yet sadly unsurprising. You need not be an economist to know how much prices have been going up this year, from the petrol pump to the supermarket checkout to direct debits. And while inflation at 10% is a remarkable figure, it is set to go even higher. Unless the government acts on energy bills, when the cap rises by a predicted 80% on 1 October, inflation will soar again. Analysts expect prices for gas and electricity to keep on increasing well into the new year. And where energy prices go, so go the costs for everything else, from food to clothes to transport.\n\nThe UK is not the only country in this mess, but its position is the most precarious of any in the rich world. Privatisation means that the British government has little control over the prices set by its utilities (unlike, say, Emmanuel Macron with EDF), while workers in the UK have far less bargaining power than their counterparts in France and Germany. Then there is Brexit, plus the long-held assumption by politicians and economists that the UK need neither own nor manufacture much of what it consumes \u2013 it can just buy it all in. The result is that inflation in the UK far outstrips that in the US, Japan, Germany or France \u2013 and financial markets expect that to remain so next year.\n\nEven before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, 2022 was set to be shaped by the cost of living. Ahead of this autumn, three things can be said with reasonable confidence. First, the Bank of England will keep raising rates \u2013 and most likely induce a recession that will harm firms and workers. Threadneedle Street will treat this week\u2019s signs of prices rising in the service sector as proof that inflation is no longer being imported, but is now settling into our economy. Second, the next prime minister will not have the war chest they hoped for. This March, the Office for Budget Responsibility calculated that the Conservative government had \u00a330bn of \u201cfiscal headroom\u201d to cut taxes and raise spending. Most of that will now go on pensions, social security and interest on public debt. Throughout this Tory leadership campaign, economics has been discussed as if in some strange blue-rinse bubble: giveaways today, or tomorrow? That bubble is heading towards a painfully sharp pin.\n\nFinally, the Conservatives are engineering an almighty clash with trade unions. Public sector workers are the ones seeing their pay fall furthest behind their bills, after more than a decade of real-terms cuts to wages, and are also most likely to be unionised. The government is well aware of this, yet has done little to alleviate the real suffering being felt by nurses and teachers and other vital workers. The obvious conclusion to be drawn is ministers want a fight. If so, they won\u2019t be disappointed. Given the battle readiness of union leaders such as Sharon Graham, this will most probably be a winter dominated by industrial strife.\n\nIt is worth recalling how much of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s project focused on suppressing prices by hammering down on workers. In that, if not much else, she was strikingly successful. And over the intervening decades Westminster has been filleted of a sense of class conflict. Politics became, as David Hare titled one of his best plays, the absence of war. Not for much longer.",

Wildpixel | Istock | Getty Images\n\nA smooth and \"complete decentralization\" of Web3 is not yet a reality, said Randi Zuckerberg, referring to a system in which users rather than companies have ownership of services and data. The sister of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was speaking at the Global Supertrends Conference 2022 on Wednesday. The Web3 is a hypothetical, future version of the internet based on blockchain technology \u2014 an \"ideal utopia,\" said Zuckerberg. \"But \u2026 that's not what's happening. What's happening in reality, is chaos.\"\n\nThe founder and CEO of Zuckerberg Media, a production company and marketing consultancy, added, \"You're the only one watching your own back and your own assets, people are spending time protecting themselves by setting up so many different wallets and protecting their identity and that's not contributing to development in the area.\" Zuckerberg, who was an early employee at Meta \u2014 formerly known as Facebook \u2014 explained that various metaverses are now acting as \"their own walled garden,\" in which users are unable to use their assets across platforms. The metaverse can be loosely defined as a virtual world where people live, work and play. With cryptocurrency, users can buy and develop virtual land or dress their own avatars.\n\n\"Right now, I'm on Decentraland, my son is on Roblox, my other son is on Fortnite. That's great \u2014 we're all in the metaverse. [But] we have no interaction with one another,\" she said. \"In order to really unlock the potential [of Web3], we're going to need to figure out a system where there's interoperability. What you have goes with you wherever you are, [and] we're not there yet,\" Zuckerberg added.\n\nGoing mainstream\n\nHowever, according to Zuckerberg, that's easier said than done because no company running a metaverse right now wants to give up control or \"share that ownership.\" \"That's why it's not we're not seeing that kind of consumer mainstream adoption yet because there needs to be a world where you leave the house with one wallet. And you need to see that same behavior online also.\" She added that Web3 needs experts who have been involved in the global banking system and Web2 \u2014 the internet that we know today \u2014 to lend a \"protective layer.\"\n\nThe need for such experts is all the more important because it has been \"too easy\" for users to be scammed or lose all their assets in Web3, said Zuckerberg. \"There needs to be more protections for consumers \u2026 I think we will wind up [with] web 2.7, where there is some centralization, keeping people safe, but the ability to port your assets with you to any site.\" Another thing that needs to be improved in Web3 is user-friendliness, she added. \"It should not take 45 steps to set up a cryptocurrency wallet, buy a currency and enter the metaverse. It needs to [be] one-stop, beginner-friendly.\"\n\nSectors with opportunities",

The argument for austerity was built on complementary, nonsensical narratives: most disabled people were faking it; most people on benefits were too lazy to work; most waste in the benefits system was lost to fraud; a class of the workshy had been created by benefits; the \u201cbig society\u201d was good, because it was much nicer to get your neighbour\u2019s help than to have properly funded public services; parents know more about education than local authorities; and so on.\n\nOpponents of this Cameron-era inanity dignified it by arguing against these propositions as though he actually meant them. What if libraries were mainly used by middle-class children? What if nurses did have to take a pay cut, or we\u2019d soon become Greece? It was just one diversionary talking point after another, as the first offensive wave proceeded completely without mishap, and the destruction of the social safety net was achieved.\n\nWith Brexit, at least we were arguing about something real: what happened in relation to Europe mattered, for our prosperity, for our intellectual life, for our rights, for the union, for the climate. But again, we were arguing from a completely false start, as if the two competing sides were legitimately different visions for Britain, one which wanted to take back control, one which didn\u2019t. In fact, the escapade was there to deliver only one outcome: the destruction of regulation by which workers and citizens protect and assert themselves against the interests of capital. It was just the second wave of the war.\n\nLiz Truss and Rishi Sunak, prime ministerial hopefuls, approach the coming crisis with another patchwork of absolute nonsense. The cost of living crisis is all down to the war in Ukraine. We head into recession because we don\u2019t work hard enough. It\u2019s all the fault of the unions, or the woke, who are coming for our growth and \u201cour women\u201d (respectively). Britain can go from strength to strength if the person in charge is enthusiastic enough (according to Truss). This time it\u2019s different \u2013 these lines are so incredibly weak and thin, it\u2019s like reaching the end of the road in a Russian misinformation campaign, where they can no longer afford any tech whizzes and they\u2019re leaving meme creation to bots and Google translate.\n\nBut it\u2019s different for a more important reason: they\u2019re not trying to divert us from some smart new move \u2013 they have no moves. If you look at the level of public debt, the high inflation, the low growth and the tax burden, we\u2019re already in a postwar economy. It was just a different kind of war, a class war masquerading as a kulturkampf, and we lost. Sorry to labour the point, but until we acknowledge the extent of the devastation and its cause we cannot hope to recover our bearings.\n\nYou cannot rebuild anything on fictional foundations. There is no meaningful way out of this if we pretend it\u2019s all about global headwinds and we\u2019re a nice nation that can pull together. You cannot organise if you don\u2019t know what side you\u2019re on, and so many of the narratives of the past 12 years have been tailored to mask exactly that. Are you a striver or a shirker? A net contributor or a net recipient? A patriot or a migrant? Metropolitan elite or left behind? Latte sipper or bitter drinker? Woke or anti-woke? Leaver or remainer? We\u2019ve been trapped in this endless cycle of meaningless divisions to mask what\u2019s incredibly plain: we\u2019re all on the same side and we\u2019re all under attack.",

Its recovery from the pandemic recession has been stunted, in part, by breakdowns in support for some of the workers who should be powering those industries\u2019 revival. The cost and availability of child care alone is keeping many potential workers sidelined, leading to an abundance of unfilled job openings and costing business owners money.\n\nYet Mr. Biden has so far been unable to deliver on many of the programs he proposed to help Americans balance work responsibilities with care for children or aging parents, and to pursue high-quality education from a young age. He could not secure universal prekindergarten or free community college tuition. He could not find support to fund child care subsidies or to extend a tax credit meant to fight child poverty. And his plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to expand and improve home health services for seniors and disabled people have also foundered.\n\nThose omissions add up to what liberal economists call a missed opportunity to help Americans work more and earn more, and to make the economy run more efficiently.\n\nMr. Biden has had more success in getting Democrats, and some Republicans, to invest in the physical economy and to embrace a more interventionist view of federal power, said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the liberal Groundwork Collaborative in Washington. By embracing industrial policy and government-induced emissions reduction, she said, \u201cHe\u2019s moved to an economic system and an economic agenda where the government is really throwing its weight around, putting its thumb on the scale,\u201d she said.\n\nBut, she added, \u201cwe didn\u2019t get the care agenda. That\u2019s a huge miss. Until we get affordable child care, our economy\u2019s not going to be at full strength.\u201d",

                "text": "Wholesale prices fell in July for the first time in two years as a plunge in energy prices slowed the pace of inflation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday.\n\nThe producer price index, which gauges the prices received for final demand products, fell 0.5% from June, the first month-over-month decrease since April 2020, the month after Covid-19 was declared a pandemic. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting an increase of 0.2%.\n\nOn an annual basis, the index rose 9.8%, the lowest rate since October 2021. That compares with an 11.3% increase in June and the record 11.7% gain in March.\n\nMost of the decline came from energy, which dropped 9% at the wholesale level and accounted for 80% of the total decline in goods prices, which fell 1.8%. The index for services rose 0.1%.\n\nStripping out food, energy and trade services, PPI increased 0.2% in July, which was less than the expected 0.4% gain. Core PPI rose 5.8% from a year ago.\n\nThe numbers come a day after the consumer price index showed that inflation was flat in July though up 8.5% from a year ago. The easing in the CPI also reflected the slide in energy prices that has seen prices at the pump fall below $4 a gallon after hitting record nominal levels above $5 earlier in the summer.\n\n\"Cooling prices paid by producers portend a further cooling for consumer prices, as producer prices are further up the inflation pipelines,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. \"We expect producer prices to ease as supply chains improve. It could take up to three months for improved supply chains to affect prices for the end consumer.\"\n\nFederal Reserve officials are watching the inflation data closely for clues about where the economy stands after more than a year of wrestling with high inflation.\n\nBefore July's easing, prices had been running at their highest levels in more than 40 years. Supply chain issues, demand imbalances, and high amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus associated with the pandemic had driven the annual CPI rate past 9%, well above the Fed's 2% long-run target.\n\nThis week's data could give the Fed reason to dial back rate increases that have come in successive 0.75 percentage point increments in June and July. Markets are now pricing in a 0.5 percentage point move in September.\n\nA separate Labor Department report Thursday showed that weekly jobless claims totaled 262,000 for the week ended Aug. 6, an increase of 14,000 from the previous week though 2,000 below the estimate.\n\nClaims have been elevated in recent weeks in a sign that a historically tight labor market is shifting. Continuing claims rose 8,000 to 1.43 million.",

                "text": "Analysts generally expect state-owned enterprises will perform better than non-state-owned developers in the latest real estate slump. Pictured here in Guangxi, China, on Aug. 15, 2022, is a real estate complex developed by state-owned conglomerate Poly Group. Future Publishing | Future Publishing | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Chinese property developers' cash flows \u2014 a sign of the companies' ability to stay afloat \u2014 shrank this year after steady growth over the last decade, according to Oxford Economics. Developer cash flows through July are down 24% year-on-year on an annualized basis, according to analysis from the firm's lead economist, Tommy Wu. That's a sharp slowdown from growth for nearly every year since at least 2009, the data showed. Total funding as of July was 15.22 trillion yuan ($2.27 trillion) on an annualized basis, versus 20.11 trillion yuan in 2021. The drop comes as credit demand in China missed expectations in July, and property developers' struggles drag on. About two years ago, Beijing started to crack down on developers' high reliance on debt for growth. Notably, Evergrande defaulted late last year. Other developers like Shimao have also defaulted, despite appearing to have healthier balance sheets.\n\nWhile investors have turned cautious on Chinese property companies, developers now face the risk of losing another important source of cash flow: homebuyer pre-payments.\n\nHomes are typically sold ahead of completion in China. But since late June, some homebuyers have protested apartment construction delays by halting mortgage payments. \"The crux of the problem is that property developers have insufficient cash flows \u2013 whether because of debt-servicing costs, low housing sales, or misuse of funds \u2013 to continue with projects,\" Wu said in a report last week. \"Resolving this problem will rebuild homebuyers' confidence in developers, which will help support housing sales and, in turn, improve developers' financial health.\" More than $2 billion in high-yield property developer debt is due in September \u2014 that's more than two times that of August, according to Morgan Stanley's analysis as of Aug. 10. About a quarter of homebuyers who bought property ahead of their completion are inclined to stop their mortgage payments if construction is suspended, the U.S. investment bank said in an Aug. 15 report, citing a proprietary AlphaWise Consumer Survey. Not only does real estate account for the bulk of household wealth in China, but analysts estimate property and industries related to real estate account for more than a quarter of China's GDP. The real estate slump has contributed to an overall slowdown in economic growth this year.\n\nIn an effort to support growth, the People's Bank of China has cut rates, including an unexpected cut on Monday of 10 basis points to some one-year interest rates for institutions, known as the medium-term lending facility. While the PBOC may hope the cut could ease some of homebuyers' burden and help developers get loans, the problem isn't just about funding, said Bruce Pang, chief economist and head of research for Greater China at JLL. He noted how developers have found it harder to obtain funding on their own, and have had to rely more on pre-sales to homebuyers. But people are increasingly cautious about buying new homes due to their expectations for future employment and returns on existing investment products, he added. Despite multiple reports of government plans to keep developers funded, the central government has yet to officially announce broader support for real estate. A readout of a high-level government meeting last month said local governments are responsible for delivering completed houses. Among three major sources of developer funding, advance payments and deposits have fallen the most this year, down by 34%, according to Wu's analysis. Credit as a source of funding dropped by 22%, while self-raised capital, including stocks and bonds, was down by 17%, the annualized data showed.\n\nInvestors turn away from China property\n\nInvestment funds have largely stayed away from Chinese property developers, reducing a potential source of funding. \"What has been worrying has been the lack of willingness and speed by top policymakers in resolving real estate developer's funding issues,\" Carol Lye, assistant portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, said in an emailed response to CNBC. Lye said the investment management firm's allocation to China real estate is low, and that Brandywine holds \"high quality real estate bonds that have been given preference in terms of government support.\" Some investors have even turned to companies in other parts of Asia. \"We've exited almost all of our holdings in China residential. It's more a wait-and-see game in terms of getting back exposure,\" said Xin Yan Low, Singapore-based portfolio manager for Asia property equities at Janus Henderson. She declined to share a timeframe of those sales. \"There are still many alternatives in the region, especially with reopening now, Singapore, Australia, basically back to full reopening, fundamentals are strong,\" she said. Top holdings in her co-managed Horizon Asia-Pacific Property Income Fund include Japan Metropolitan Fund Invest, Mapletree Logistics Trust and Hang Lung Properties.\n\nRead more about China from CNBC Pro JPMorgan says buy this undervalued Chinese biopharma stock that can rally more than 40% from here",

The UK does lag behind many other western countries in the productivity league table. Across the G7 group of major industrial countries, the average worker produces 13% more an hour than the average British worker and the gap is getting bigger.\n\nOfficial data also appears to show a divide between London and the rest of the country, with workers in the capital apparently 80% more productive than the national average. Truss suggests this is a mindset issue.\n\nThe idea, though, that the UK\u2019s deep-rooted economic problems are caused by shirking or a lack of effort does not stand up to serious scrutiny. Britain has one of the most deregulated labour markets in the developed world and the average British worker puts in more hours a week than the European average.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To the extent Truss\u2019s analysis was ever true, it harks back to a labour market that has long since disappeared \u2013 now replaced by one in which an army of gig economy and self-employed workers toil away to make a living.\n\nThe real reason for Britain\u2019s poor productivity lies elsewhere. UK business investment as a share of national output, or gross domestic product, is the lowest in the G7. It is a similar story with research and development, to which the UK devotes 1.7% of GDP annually, compared with an average of 3.1% for members of the developed country club, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nBritain\u2019s economic model is based on an abundance of cheap labour and under-investment in up to date capital equipment and product innovation. Skills levels are higher in a country such as Germany because the Germans invest more in training.\n\nThe difference between Britain and better performing countries is not that they work harder than we do, but that they work smarter than we do. Foreign-owned companies in the UK tend to have higher productivity, so if \u201cmindset\u201d is the issue then it is the mindset of management that counts.\n\nNor is it really the case that productivity is higher in London because workers in the capital have a \u201ccan do\u201d spirit lacking elsewhere. As a paper from researchers at Sheffield Hallam University found, once adjusted for factors including the size of the working age population, the concentration of high productivity jobs in finance and the number of hours worked, the gap virtually disappears.\n\nTruss\u2019s team say the remarks made some years ago have been taken out of context but they seem pretty clear. If Boris Johnson\u2019s probable successor thinks more graft is needed, she is completely misdiagnosing the problem.",

                "text": "Pandemic fraud became such an open secret that it ceased to be much of a secret at all. In September 2020, a California rapper named Fontrell Antonio Baines, who performs as Nuke Bizzle, posted a music video on YouTube, bragging in detail about how he had gotten rich by submitting false unemployment claims. His song was called \u201cEDD,\u201d after California\u2019s Employment Development Department, which paid the benefits.\n\n\u201cI just seen 30 cards land in one day. Got straight on the phone and activate,\u201d Mr. Baines rapped in the song, flashing cash and envelopes with preloaded debit cards from the state.\n\n\u201cUnemployment so sweet,\u201d he said.\n\nAll three of those programs are now over. There is no official estimate for the amount of money that was stolen from them \u2014 or from pandemic-relief programs in general. The Justice Department has charged people with about $1 billion in fraud so far, and is investigating other cases involving $6 billion more, investigators said.\n\nBut other reports have suggested the real number could be much higher. One official said the total of \u201cimproper\u201d unemployment payments could be more than $163 billion, as first reported by The Washington Post. In the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, a watchdog found that $58 billion had been paid to companies that shared the same addresses, phone numbers, bank accounts or other data as other applicants \u2014 a sign of potential fraud.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear there\u2019s tens of billions in fraud,\u201d said Michael Horowitz, the chairman of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, which includes 21 agency inspectors general working on fraud cases. \u201cWould it surprise me if it exceeded $100 billion? No.\u201d\n\nThe effort to catch fraudsters began as soon as the money started flowing, and the first person was charged with benefit fraud in May 2020. But investigators were quickly deluged with tips at a scale they had never dealt with before. The Small Business Administration\u2019s fraud hotline \u2014 which had previously received 800 calls a year \u2014 got 148,000 in the first year of the pandemic. The Small Business Administration sent its inspector general two million loan applications to check for potential identity theft. At the Labor Department, the inspector general\u2019s office has 39,000 cases of suspected unemployment fraud, a 1,000 percent increase from prepandemic levels.",

                "text": "A shopping cart is seen in a supermarket as inflation affected consumer prices in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., June 10, 2022. Andrew Kelly | Reuters\n\nIf inflation has been the biggest threat to U.S. economic growth, then July's data should provide signs that there's at least some relief in the pipeline. Prices were flat for the month as gauged by the items that the Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks for its consumer price index. That marked the first time the aggregate measure hadn't posted a month-over-month increase since May 2020, when the widely followed index showed a modest decline. Just a month ago, CPI posted its fastest 12-month gain since November 1982, following a trend that helped send economic growth into contraction for the first half of the year, stirring up talk of a recession. But with at least the short-term trend indicating the rate of price increases is abating, economic optimism is perking up.\n\nNo recession, for now\n\n\"The whole recession narrative really needs to be put on a shelf for now,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies. \"I think it's going to be shifting to a stronger-for-longer narrative, which is really supported by a reversal in inflation.\" Markowska, whose forecasts this year have been accurate, sees solid growth in the near term, including a 3% growth rate in the third quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow gauge, which tracks economic data in real time, pointed to a 2.5% growth rate in a Wednesday update, up 1.1 percentage points from its last one on Aug. 4. However, Markowska also expects pressures to intensify in 2023, with a recession likely in the back part of the year. Indeed, there was a little bit for both arguments in the CPI report. Most of the tempering in inflation came because of a fall in energy prices. Gasoline slid 7.7%, the biggest monthly decline since April 2020. Fuel oil tumbled 11% as energy-related commodity prices were off 7.6%.\n\nTransportation services cost increases also came off the boil, with airline fares tumbling 7.8% to reverse a trend that has seen tickets surge 27.7% over the past year. But there were few other signs of inflation declines in the report, with food costs particularly high. The food index, in fact, rose 1.1% on the month, and its 10.9% pace over the past 12 months is the highest since May 1979. That's causing worries at places such as City Harvest, which helps feed needy New Yorkers who have been hit especially hard by price surge that began last year. \"We're seeing many more children come into food pantries,\" said Jilly Stephens, the organization's CEO. \"Food insecurity had been intractable even before the pandemic hit. Now we're seeing even more people turn to food pantries because of the rising prices.\" Stephens said the number of children seeking food assistance about doubled a year after the Covid pandemic hit, and the organization is struggling to keep up. \"We're always optimistic, because we are supported by incredibly generous New Yorkers,\" she said.\n\nPeople keep spending",

The captain of the ship is on shore leave, right, nobody\u2019s in charge at the moment.\u201d\n\nLord Rose, who is a former boss of Marks & Spencer, said action was needed to kill \u201cpernicious\u201d inflation, which he said \u201cerodes wealth over time\u201d. He dismissed claims by the Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss\u2019s camp that it would be possible for the UK to grow its way out of the crisis.\n\nRose told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWe are sitting here now into the second, third, fourth month into this crisis and we\u2019re still waiting to see what action will be taken \u2026 I would like to see us looking after those who need it most.\u201d\n\n\"I don't believe you can grow your way out of inflation\"\n\n\n\nLord Rose, Chairman of ASDA, tells @JustinOnWeb the government must 'kill inflation' before focusing on economic growth. https://t.co/UTmmDpWHD2 | #R4Today pic.twitter.com/I3ovrm8MjH \u2014 BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) August 17, 2022\n\nHe said inflation \u201cpicks on the poorest hardest, but we have to deal with it, we can\u2019t ignore it\u201d. The peer said he believed that interest rates would have to rise further to tackle rising prices, and that the UK was \u201cheading towards a recession\u201d.\n\nRose, who is backing Truss\u2019s rival, Rishi Sunak, to become the next prime minister, criticised the candidates in the Tory leadership race for \u201cthrowing money at everything\u201d.\n\nAs households worry about their energy bills rising even further in October, when the energy price cap is updated, more than 130,000 people have signed a petition backing a call by the former prime minister Gordon Brown for an emergency budget to tackle the energy and cost of living crisis.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Zahawi also denounced Labour\u2019s plan to freeze energy bills, stating it would reward \u201cpeople like me who are at the wealthier end of the spectrum\u201d.\n\nUnison called the cost of living crisis a \u201cliving nightmare for millions of working people\u201d. The union \u2013 which represents more than 1.3 million members providing services in education, local government, the NHS, police service and energy \u2013 is calling for above-inflation pay rises to help workers cope with rocketing prices.\n\n\u201cThe government and those angling to be the next PM appear indifferent to the plight of those struggling to make ends meet,\u201d said Jon Richards, a Unison assistant general secretary. \u201cMinisters are deluded if they think workers can put up with yet more misery.\u201d\n\nThe former Bank of England policymaker Andrew Sentance said pay rises being received by workers could push inflation higher still.\n\n\u201cYou can see what is happening in the labour market, with employees looking to recoup some of the rise in the cost of living through wage increases. If you look at the official figures for wage increases in the private sector, they are running at about 6%. That is way ahead of what is compatible with a 2% inflation target,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\nSentance, now a senior adviser at the consultancy Cambridge Econometrics, said the Bank of England needed to \u201cput a brake\u201d on wage increases, and predicted the Bank could raise interest rates to 4% by the end of the year.",

                "text": "Prices that consumers pay for a variety of goods and services rose 8.5% in July from a year ago, a slowing pace from the previous month due largely to a drop in gasoline prices. On a monthly basis, the consumer price index was flat as energy prices broadly declined 4.6% and gasoline fell 7.7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That offset a 1.1% monthly gain in food prices and a 0.5% increase in shelter costs. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting headline CPI to increase 8.7% on an annual basis and 0.2% monthly.\n\nExcluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core CPI rose 5.9% annually and 0.3% monthly, compared with respective estimates of 6.1% and 0.5%.\n\nEven with the lower-than-expected numbers, inflation pressures remained strong. The jump in the food index put the 12-month increase to 10.9%, the fastest pace since May 1979. Butter is up 26.4% over the past year, eggs have surged 38% and coffee is up more than 20%. Despite the monthly drop in the energy index, electricity prices rose 1.6% and were up 15.2% from a year ago. The energy index rose 32.9% from a year ago. Used vehicle prices posted a 0.4% monthly decline, while apparel prices also fell, easing 0.1%, and transportation services were off 0.5% as airline fares fell 1.8% for the month and 7.8% from a year ago. Markets reacted positively to the report, with futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 400 points and government bond yields down sharply. \"Things are moving in the right direction,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies. \"This is the most encouraging report we've had in quite some time.\" The report was good news for workers, who saw a 0.5% monthly increase in real wages. Inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings were still down 3% from a year ago. Shelter costs, which make up about one-third of the CPI weighting, continued to rise and are up 5.7% over the past 12 months.\n\nPeople shop at a grocery store on June 10, 2022 in New York City.

Market pricing is for a half-point rate hike at the September meeting, though that remains a close call.\n\nMeeting participants noted that the 2.25%-2.50% range for the federal funds rate was around the \"neutral\" level that is neither supportive nor restrictive on activity. Some officials said a restrictive stance likely will be appropriate, indicating more rate hikes to come.\n\n\"With inflation remaining well above the Committee's objective, participants judged that moving to a restrictive stance of policy was required to meet the Committee's legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability,\" the minutes said.\n\nThe document also reflected the idea that once the Fed gets comfortable with its policy stance and sees it having an impact on inflation, it could start to take its foot off the policy brake. That notion has helped push stocks into a strong summer rally.\n\n\"Participants judged that, as the stance of monetary policy tightened further, it likely would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjustments on economic activity and inflation,\" the minutes said.\n\nHowever, the summary also stated that some participants said \"it likely would be appropriate to maintain that level for some time to ensure that inflation was firmly on a path back to 2 percent.\"",

But Ms. Bettis thinks she can save enough money to open her own storefront.\n\n\u201cWe just went through a period where millions died, so are you going to spend your time at your job if it doesn\u2019t fulfill you?\u201d Ms. Bettis said, summing up gig work\u2019s appeal. \u201cEverybody loves stability, but if the flexibility isn\u2019t there, I don\u2019t think a lot of people are going to go back.\u201d\n\nLabor advocates have long been concerned about businesses that depend on independent contractors, since those workers aren\u2019t entitled to the rights and benefits that come with employee status, like employer contributions to payroll taxes and unemployment insurance. But while the model has gained traction, it has been difficult to pin down how fast the ranks of gig workers are growing.\n\nThe most accurate measure is Internal Revenue Service data on 1099 tax forms \u2014 the freelancers\u2019 counterpart to the W-2 forms filed for employees \u2014 but that is available only to select researchers and released with a lag of several years. At last count, in 2018, a team of economists found that about 1.2 percent of workers with any earnings had at least some income from online platform work. (A Pew survey from 2021 found that the share of all adults with gig income in a 12-month period was about 9 percent.)\n\nThe closest government metric that is more timely comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which asks people whether they count themselves as self-employed. That number rose significantly as a share of the labor force from early 2020 to early this year. But it generally captures people for whom self-employment is the main source of income \u2014 which, for most gig workers, it isn\u2019t. More likely, the bump represents an increase in the number of people working as home improvement contractors and owner-operator truck drivers \u2014 two longtime means of self-employment that surged during the pandemic \u2014 and some white-collar freelancers.",

                "text": "Farmers harvest a wheat field near Melitopol in Ukraine. Wheat, soybean, sugar, and corn futures have fallen from their March highs back to prices seen at the start of 2022. Olga Maltseva | Afp | Getty Images\n\nFood prices dropped significantly in July from the previous month, particularly the costs of wheat and vegetable oil, according to the latest figures from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. But the FAO said that while the drop in food prices \"from very high levels\" is \"welcome,\" there are doubts over whether the good news will last. \"Many uncertainties remain, including high fertilizer prices that can impact future production prospects and farmers' livelihoods, a bleak global economic outlook, and currency movements, all of which pose serious strains for global food security,\" FAO chief economist Maximo Torero said in a press release. The FAO food price index, which tracks the monthly change in the global prices of a basket of food commodities, fell 8.6% in July from the month before. In June, the index fell just 2.3% month on month. However, the index in July was still 13.1% higher than July 2021.\n\nPrices in the short term may fall further, if futures are anything to go by. Wheat, soybean, sugar, and corn futures have fallen from their March highs back to prices seen at the start of 2022. For example, the wheat contracts closed at $775.75 per bushel on Friday, down from a 12-year high of $1,294 in March, and around the $758 price set in January.\n\nWhy prices fell\n\nAnalysts cited a mix of both demand and supply reasons for the slide in food prices: Ukraine and Russia's closely watched agreement to resume exports of grain through the Black Sea after months of blockade; better-than-expected crop harvests; a global economic slowdown; and the strong U.S. dollar. Rob Vos, the director of markets, trade and institutions at the International Food Policy Research Institute, pointed to the news that the United States and Australia are set to deliver bumper wheat harvests this year, which will improve supply since shipment from Ukraine and Russia have been curtailed. The higher U.S. dollar also lowers the price of staples, since commodities are priced in U.S. dollars, Vos said. Traders tend to ask for lower nominal dollar prices of commodities when the greenback is expensive. The widely heralded U.N.-backed deal between Ukraine and Russia also helped to cool the market. Ukraine was the world's sixth-biggest wheat exporter in 2021, accounting for 10% of global wheat market share, according to the United Nations. The first shipment of Ukrainian grain \u2014 26,000 tons of maize \u2014 since the invasion left the country's southwestern port of Odesa last Monday.\n\nSkepticism over Ukraine-Russia deal\n\nGlobal skepticism over whether Russia will keep its end of the bargain hangs in the air. Russia fired a missile onto Odesa just hours after the U.N.-brokered deal in late-July. And freight and insurance companies may still think it's too risky to ship grain out of a war zone, Vos said, adding that food prices remain volatile and any new shock can cause more price surges. \"To make a difference it will not be enough to get a few shipments out, but at least 30 or 40 per month to get the existing grains stored in Ukraine out, as well as the produce of the upcoming harvest,\" said Vos. \"To help stabilize markets, the deal will need to hold in full also during the second half of the year since that is the period where Ukraine does most of its exports.\"\n\nEven with the existing agreement, arable Ukrainian land may continue to be destroyed \"for as long as the war continues,\" which will result in even less crop yield next year, Carlos Mera, the head of agri commodities market research at Rabobank, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Europe\" last week. \"Once this [grain] corridor is over, we might see even more price increases going forward,\" Mera said. Consumers could also see further price increases as there is normally a lag of three to nine months before a movement in commodity prices is reflected on supermarket shelves. Then there is the pressure of exporting enough grain as quickly as possible from a war zone. \"It's time that we're working again. I don't see us exporting two [to] five million tons per month out of these Black Sea ports,\" John Rich, the executive chairman of Ukrainian poultry giant Myronivsky Hliboproduct (MHP), told CNBC's \"Capital Connection\" on Monday. \"Hungry people, at the end of the day, get hungry very quickly after a week.\" In a note published earlier this month, credit rating agency Fitch Ratings' analysts wrote that a possible increase in fertilizer prices, which fell recently \u2014 but which are still double that of 2020 \u2014 could cause grain prices to jump again. Russia's restriction of gas supply has led European natural gas prices to spike. Natural gas is a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers. La Nina weather patterns could disrupt grain harvests later this year as well, they added.\n\nAnd the fall in food prices is not all good news. Part of the reason why staples have become cheaper is that traders and investors are pricing in recessionary fears, the analysts said. The global manufacturing purchasing managers' index has been in decline, while the U.S. Federal Reserve seems bent on raising interest rates to curb inflation even if it triggers a recession, the Fitch team wrote.\n\nFood staples",

                "text": "Check out the companies making the biggest moves midday:\n\nTarget \u2014 Shares of the retailer slid more than 2% after its earnings missed Wall Street expectations by a wide margin. The company said its quarterly profit fell almost 90% from a year ago. However, Target reiterated its full-year forecast and said it is now positioned for a rebound.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond \u2014 Shares of the meme stock jumped about 12% on Wednesday, continuing a torrid August rally for the challenged retailer. The stock has seen abnormally high trading volume and is the most popular topic on Reddit page WallStreetBets.\n\nKrispy Kreme \u2014 The doughnut chain slid 12% after it reported quarterly results that included lower-than-expected profit and revenue. The company also said it has seen significant deceleration in commodity costs in recent weeks.\n\nWeber \u2014 Shares of the grill maker dropped more than 7% after Citi downgraded Weber to sell from neutral. The company's weak sales outlook and dwindling cash on hand means that Weber may have to raise additional capital, Citi said.\n\nTeladoc Health \u2014 Shares of Teladoc slipped almost 9% after Guggenheim downgraded the company to sell from neutral. The firm said Teladoc's pace of growth is set to slow in a challenging macroeconomic environment with a weakening consumer.\n\nSanofi \u2014 The French drugmaker hit a 52-week low, with its U.S.-traded shares dropping almost 6%. Sanofi announced Wednesday it discontinued the development of its breast cancer treatment, amcenestrant, after the trial showed no signs that the drug was effective.\n\nAppLovin \u2014 Shares of the tech company dropped more than 7% in midday trading. The company's $20 billion bid for Unity was rejected by Unity's board on Monday. Unity shares were also down nearly 3%.\n\nTake-Two Interactive \u2014 Shares of the software company fell almost 3% after being downgraded by Deutsche Bank to hold from buy. Analysts cited a balanced risk/reward outlook this year and a lack of material near-term catalysts over the next few quarters. However, Deutsche Bank remains constructive on Take-Two Interactive's long-term growth outlook.\n\nAnalog Devices \u2014 Shares dropped almost 5% after CEO Vincent Roche said \"economic uncertainty is beginning to impact bookings\" at the semiconductor company. Otherwise, Analog Devices reported a beat on the top and bottom lines in its calendar second-quarter earnings. Other chip stocks, including Nvidia, Applied Materials and Micron sank about 3% amid the news and Advanced Micro Devices lost almost 2%.\n\nAgilent Technologies \u2014 Shares of Agilent jumped more than 7% after the maker of lab instruments posted better-than-expected profit and revenue for its most recent quarter, according to Refinitiv. The company also raised its full-year forecast due to strong order flow.\n\nTech stocks \u2014 Shares of Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet and Meta Platforms dropped by about 2% after the 10-year Treasury yield moved sharply higher.",

                "text": "The annual inflation rate has burst through the 10% barrier sooner than the financial markets and the Bank of England expected, but the sharp jump in the cost of living last month is not really that much of a shock.\n\nPeriods of double-digit inflation are pretty rare in the UK. In the past 70 years, inflation has been as high as it is currently only three times: during the Korean war in the early 1950s, and after the two oil shocks of the mid- and late 1970s.\n\nNot for 40 years \u2013 since the period immediately before the Falklands war \u2013 has inflation climbed above 10%, but there has been upward pressure on the cost of living since the global economy started to emerge from the pandemic-enforced lockdowns during 2021.\n\nConsistently over the past year, the figure has come in higher than forecast, but it will not merely be the leap in the headline number for the consumer prices index (CPI) \u2013 up from 9.4% in June \u2013 that will be a cause for concern.\n\nFor a start, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said price increases were evident pretty much across the board. The ONS splits the CPI into 12 categories, and in nine of them inflation picked up last month. Food prices rose particularly strongly but there were also increases in clothing and footwear, restaurants and hotels, and recreation and culture.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there is clearly further bad news to come. The price of goods leaving factory gates \u2013 an indication of inflation in the pipeline \u2013 rose by more than 17% in the year to July, the highest rate in 45 years.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Oil prices are well below their peak and that is feeding in \u2013 albeit slowly \u2013 to the prices paid by motorists for petrol and diesel. The war in Ukraine has also prompted many countries to plant more crops to compensate for the lost supply, and while the ONS says the increased production has yet to be reflected in UK shop prices, it thinks it will have an effect over the coming months.\n\nEven so, the annual inflation rate has clearly not yet topped out, and if anything the Bank of England\u2019s forecast of a peak of 13.2% in October may prove optimistic.\n\nThreadneedle Street digs beneath the headline CPI figure to look at measures of core inflation. Here, too, there was bad news. Inflation excluding food, fuel, alcohol and tobacco, stood at 6.2% in July, up from 5.8% in June. The inflation rate for services, which provides a clue to price pressures generated domestically as opposed to global forces, was 5.7% in July, compared with 5.2% in June.\n\nThe strength of headline and underlying inflation makes it more likely that the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee will follow its 0.5 percentage-point increase in interest rates this month with a similar-sized move when it meets again in September.\n\nAt the same time, the risks of a hard landing for the economy have increased because the ever-widening gap between prices and wages is leading to a sharp fall in consumer spending power.\n\nThe ONS reported on Tuesday that regular real wages \u2013 excluding bonuses \u2013 were falling at a record rate of 3% \u2013 but that was based on a different measure of the cost of living to the one used by the government to assess whether its 2% inflation target is being hit.\n\nUsing the government\u2019s preferred measure, real earnings are falling by more than 5% \u2013 unprecedented in modern times.

While that has been good for exporters \u2014 whose products have grown cheaper for foreign customers \u2014 it has driven up prices of imports, which have already become more expensive because of shortages and supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nWhile inflation in Japan \u2014 at around 2 percent in June \u2014 is still much lower than in many other countries, it has forced some companies to substantially raise prices for the first time in years, potentially dampening demand from consumers accustomed to paying the same amounts year after year.\n\nThe gradual return to normal economic activity produced strong growth in private investment, Monday\u2019s data showed.\n\nThe growth was driven in part by spending to improve companies\u2019 sustainability and digital infrastructure \u2014 efforts strongly promoted by government policies, said Wakaba Kobayashi, an economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research.\n\nStill, it is not clear how long that growth can continue, she said. Among many businesses, \u201cthere is a sense that the global economy is going to continue to decelerate,\u201d she said. The economies of the United States, China and Europe have slowed more rapidly than expected in recent months because of the Ukraine war, inflation and the pandemic.\n\nJapan faces other challenges both at home and abroad. Small- and medium-size enterprises in particular are likely to struggle as pandemic subsidies come to an end and foot traffic to their businesses remains below prepandemic levels.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nThe consumer outlook for inflation decreased significantly in July amid a sharp drop in gas prices and a growing belief that the rapid surges in food and housing also would ebb in the future. The New York Federal Reserve's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations showed that respondents expect inflation to run at a 6.2% pace over the next year and a 3.2% rate for the next three years. While those numbers are still very high by historical standards, they mark a big drop-off from the respective 6.8% and 3.6% results from the June survey. Through June, food prices rose 10.4% over the past year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They are still expected to climb 6.7% over the next 12 months, but that's a decline from the June survey of 2.5 percentage points, the biggest fall in a data series going back to June 2013.\n\nLikewise, respondents see gas prices, which rose 60% over the past year, increasing at just a 1.5% pace over the next year, a slide of 4.2 percentage points from June, the second-biggest monthly decline in the survey's history. The price of regular gas has come down about 67 cents a gallon over the past month though it remains 87 cents higher than a year ago, according to AAA. Commodity prices overall have been falling significantly as well. Finally, home prices are expected to rise 3.5% from June's 4.4%, the lowest projected gain since November 2020. Five-year inflation expectations also slipped, dropping 0.5 percentage point to 2.3%.",

                "text": "Check out the companies making headlines before the bell:\n\nLowe's (LOW) \u2013 Lowe's rose 1% in the premarket after it reported quarterly earnings of $4.67 per share, 9 cents above estimates. The home improvement retailer saw both revenue and comparable store sales come in below analyst forecasts but predicted full-year earnings would come in at the top end of its guidance range.\n\nTarget (TGT) \u2013 Target fell 3.3% in premarket trading after the retailer reported quarterly earnings of 39 cents per share, well short of the 72-cent consensus estimate. Target's revenue matched estimates, but it cut prices significantly during the quarter to reduce excess inventory. Target said the 1.2% operating margin rate during the second quarter would improve to about 6% in the back half of the year.\n\nTJX (TJX) \u2013 The parent of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls retail chains beat estimates by 3 cents with a quarterly profit of 69 cents per share, but revenue and comparable store sales came in less than expected. TJX cut its full-year forecast as well, saying inflation impacted the spending habits of its customers, and the stock fell 1.2% in the premarket.\n\nKrispy Kreme (DNUT) \u2013 Krispy Kreme tumbled 14.7% in premarket action after the doughnut chain reported lower-than-expected profit and revenue for the second quarter. Krispy Kreme said it is seeing significant deceleration in commodity costs in recent weeks.\n\nManchester United (MANU) \u2013 Manchester United rose 4.6% in the premarket after Elon Musk tweeted that he was buying the British football team and then subsequently said he was joking.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) \u2013 Bed Bath & Beyond surged 22.8% in the pre-market after registering over 20% gains in each of the past three sessions. The retailer's shares \u2013 which have been popular with \"meme stock\" investors, are up in 14 of the past 15 sessions, more than quadrupling in value over that stretch.\n\nAgilent Technologies (A) \u2013 Agilent rallied 6.6% in premarket trading after the life sciences and diagnostics company reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue. Agilent also raised its full-year forecast on strong order flow.\n\nSouthwest Gas (SWX) \u2013 Southwest Gas rose 4.7% in premarket action after investor Carl Icahn raised his stake in the utility company to 8.7% from 7.6%.\n\nSanofi (SNY) \u2013 Sanofi shares slid 5.4% in premarket trading after the French drug maker halted development of breast cancer treatment amcenestrant. The halt came after a trial showed no signs that the drug was effective.",

                "text": "UK inflation has risen above 10% for the first time in 40 years, driven by soaring prices for food and fuel as households come under mounting pressure from the cost of living crisis.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said the consumer prices index rose by 10.1% in the year to July, up from a reading of 9.4% in June and entering double figures at an earlier stage than anticipated. The figure was last higher in February 1982.\n\nIt is only the fourth time in 70 years that inflation has breached the 10% threshold, the other periods being 1951-52, 1973-77 and 1979-82.\n\nThe reading exceeded the 9.8% forecast from City economists, as the cost of food and drink rose at the highest rates since 2008 amid a broad-based inflationary burst across the economy.\n\nThe biggest increases came for bread and cereals, dairy, meat and vegetables, with the rising cost of food leading to record increases for restaurant and hotel prices and pushing up the cost of takeaways. Price rises for other staple items such as pet food, toilet rolls, toothbrushes and deodorants also sent inflation soaring.\n\nPrices for package holidays and air fares rose sharply, driven by a summer rush reflected in packed airports across the country.\n\nThe latest figures will pile renewed pressure on the government and Conservative leadership candidates amid accusations the frontrunner, Liz Truss, and Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, are failing to grasp the scale of the cost of living emergency.\n\nRachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said soaring prices were leaving families worried about how to make ends meet in the run-up to a difficult winter. \u201cPeople are worried sick, and while the Tories are busy fighting and ignoring the scale of this crisis. Only Labour can give Britain the fresh start it needs,\u201d she said.\n\nHouseholds are expected to come under further pressure this autumn from a fresh rise in energy bills, which the Bank of England forecasts will drive inflation above 13% and trigger a long recession as families rein in their spending.\n\nSoaring energy prices in Europe, exacerbated by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, have fuelled high inflation across the continent. Although petrol and diesel prices in Britain eased in July from record levels seen a month earlier, the ONS said costs remained significantly higher than a year earlier, adding to inflation.\n\nEconomists warned that soaring food prices and rising energy bills would hit poorer families hardest. \u201cIt will take many months, and much more living standards pain, before inflation starts to ease,\u201d said James Smith, a research director at the Resolution Foundation thinktank. \u201cSo, the number one priority for the next prime minister will be to offer significant support to help millions of families through a brutal winter and beyond.\u201d\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Truss has suggested there would be no more \u201chandouts\u201d to help families, prioritising tax cuts instead.\n\nCharities have called for a doubling of support for the poorest families to avert rising poverty this winter. \u201cNo one can disagree this is a national emergency,\u201d said Rebecca McDonal\u00ad\u00add, the chief economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s sobering reading means the next few months will be profoundly more difficult. People are looking for a sign that help is on the way. Yet the government doesn\u2019t seem to have grasped the full scale and urgency of this situation.\u201d\n\nAnnual energy bills in Great Britain are forecast to rise to more than \u00a33,500 from October, with a further jump to more than \u00a34,200 in January expected, up from a current level of just under \u00a32,000. Labour has said it would freeze the price cap.\n\nBills had been limited to \u00a31,400 as recently as October last year. Ofgem, the industry regulator for Great Britain, is expected to announce plans for this autumn\u2019s price cap next week.\n\nThe chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, said getting inflation under control was his top priority, while the government would act to support hard-pressed families. \u201cI understand that times are tough, and people are worried about increases in prices that countries around the world are facing,\u201d he added.",

Gannet77 | Getty Images\n\nBritain's Post Office, which offers banking services as well as mail, handled a record \u00a3801 million ($967 million) in personal cash withdrawals in July. In total, more than \u00a33.3 billion in cash was withdrawn and deposited over the Post Office's counters \u2014 the first time the amount has crossed the \u00a33.3 billion threshold in its 360-year history. Personal cash withdrawals were up almost 8% month on month at \u00a3744 in June, and up over 20% from a year ago to \u00a3665 million in July.\n\nStaycations and budgeting\n\nThe spike in cash use is down to several factors. \"Firstly, more people use cash when they go on staycation, secondly, the Post Office helped to hand out support to energy customers in the form of cash, and thirdly, people are using it as a budgeting method,\" said Laura Suter, head of finance at AJ Bell. The Post Office research found that 71% of Brits planning to go on holiday in the U.K. this year intend to take out cash before doing so. Of those who have holidayed in the U.K. in the last five years, almost a third admitted to being caught out by not having cash on them. In July, the Post Office processed more than 600,000 cash payouts for people eligible for energy bill support from the British government. That came to around \u00a390 million and allowed people to pay energy bills, top up gas and electricity meters or use cash for easier budgeting. In total, \u00a33.31 billion in cash deposits and withdrawals were processed at the Post Office in July, \u00a3100 million higher than in June. The data comes as the country continues to grapple with rising inflation. The Bank of England expects headline inflation to peak at 13.3% in October and to remain at elevated levels throughout much of 2023.\n\nIs it here to stay?",

It comes as China's economy registered growth of just 2.5% in the first half of the year.\n\n\"Now is the most critical juncture for economic rebound,\" Li said at a meeting Tuesday, according to an English-language readout. He called for \"resolute and prompt efforts\" to strengthen the foundation for recovery.\n\nMuch of that responsibility lies with six \"economically strong provinces\" that account for 45% of national GDP, the readout said. It said the six provinces also make up nearly 60% of the national total for trade and foreign investment.\n\nThe leaders of the coastal, export-heavy provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong spoke via video at an economic meeting with Li on Tuesday, the readout said.

                "text": "Millions of people are being short-changed on savings rates, with banks and building societies failing to pass on this month\u2019s 0.5 percentage point interest rate rise, research has claimed.\n\nWhat\u2019s happened?\n\nOn 4 August, the Bank of England pushed up interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 1.75% as the UK battles to prevent inflation running out of control. It was the sixth successive interest rate hike.\n\nIn theory this is good news for the UK\u2019s army of savers, who were the losers from years of interest rate cuts. Many will have been expecting to see the rates on their savings accounts climb \u2013 but the reality has all too often been very different.\n\nSo what\u2019s the bad news?\n\nResearch issued on Tuesday found that as of 15 August, Britain\u2019s banks and building societies had passed on the full 0.5 percentage point increase to just two out of 233 easy access savings accounts.\n\nAs of that date, the only provider to pass on all of the increase was the West Brom building society, according to the study by the website Investing Reviews.\n\nProviders that had given their accounts some sort of boost \u2013 that is, they had passed on part of the increase \u2013 included Zopa, Tesco Bank, Atom Bank, Tandem Bank, Skipton building society and Gatehouse Bank, it said.\n\nIn all, only 26 easy access accounts (11.2%) had seen any increase at all in the rate paid following the 4 August rise, the study said.\n\nDo banks have to pass on interest rate rises?\n\nAccount providers are at liberty to do what they want with savings rates unfortunately. They might decide to pass on all, some or none of an interest rate rise (or reduction).\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So \u2013 taking a glass-half-full view \u2013 just because your account has not as of today had its rate increased does not mean you will not get an increase.\n\nOne expert said: \u201cTo be fair, it is a little early to see savings changes \u2026 Some brands may only now be catching up to prior base rate rises.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Rachel Springall at the financial data firm Moneyfacts said: \u201cAs we have seen time and time again, there is no guarantee savings providers will boost their rates because of a Bank of England rate rise and, even if they do, it could take a few months to trickle through to customers.\u201d\n\nOn 23 January this year, more than five weeks after the Bank of England lifted the base rate from 0.1% to 0.25%, the Guardian reported that only four financial firms had passed on the full rise to all, or nearly all, of their variable-rate savings account customers.\n\nSo some people have benefited from savings rate increases?\n\nOverall, according to figures issued on Monday by Moneyfacts, the average easy access rate has risen to 0.7% and stands at its highest point in nine years. In August last year the average was 0.18%.\n\nSo why aren\u2019t providers increasing savings rates?\n\nSome experts have previously argued that most of the big banks are uninterested in attracting savers\u2019 deposits.\n\nSome will say the banks are relying on customer apathy. Some customers will quit in search of a better deal, if they can find one, but many others will not notice the change or will not get around to moving their money.\n\nBut rising interest rates are obviously good news for savers?\n\nYes of course, but unfortunately, even if the latest increase is passed on in full, rising inflation \u2013 currently 9.4% and set to go higher \u2013 is eroding the value of people\u2019s nest-egg cash.",

                "text": "Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading.\n\nWalmart, Home Depot \u2014 The retailers' shares rose about 5% each after both companies reported better-than-expected earnings for the most recent quarter. That lifted other retail stocks, which led market gains. Bath & Body Works jumped 6%. Target and Best Buy each added about 5%. Ross Stores, Lowe's and TJX Companies climbed about 3% each.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond \u2014 The home retailer's shares skyrocketed about 64%. At its highest, shares added more than 70% to touch an intraday high of $28.60 Tuesday amid multiple trading halts due to volatility. The rally came as retail traders active on social media piled into the stock, encouraged by news that GameStop chair Ryan Cohen placed another bet on the struggling retailer.\n\nNu Holdings \u2014 Shares of the Warren Buffett-backed digital banking company surged more than 23% after the firm reported quarterly revenue that rose 230% from a year earlier. Berkshire Hathaway owned $400 million of Nu Holdings shares at the end of the second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter.\n\nZipRecruiter \u2014 Shares of ZipRecruiter slipped 5% even though it posted second-quarter results that were better than expected. The company said it sees employers pulling back on job postings. It also expects the labor market's strength may weaken through the end of the year and lowered its full-year revenue outlook to reflect the economic backdrop.\n\nZoom Video \u2014 Shares of the video teleconferencing service fell about 5% after Citi downgraded the company, saying growing competition from Microsoft Teams could push the stock down 20%. The bank said Zoom has too many post-pandemic challenges in addition to rising competition, including macro-related weakness hitting businesses and margin risk.\n\nSnowflake \u2014 The cloud computing company's shares fell 5% after UBS downgraded them to neutral from buy amid mounting macro and competitive pressures. UBS also cited a slowdown in customer spending of cloud computing as well as rising competition.\n\nThredUp \u2014 The apparel reselling platform operator rallied more than 17% after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue, as well as a 29% increase in active buyers.\n\nAlly Financial \u2014 Shares of the home and auto lender jumped over 3% after a regulatory filing showed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway more than tripled its position in the company's last quarter. Berkshire held roughly 30 million shares of Ally, worth about $1 billion, at the end of June. The conglomerate initiated the bet in the first quarter.\n\nMasimo \u2014 Shares of the medical technology developer jumped more than 6% after activist investor Politan Capital Management took a 9% stake in the company. Politan said it's dedicated to improving Masimo's stock price.\n\nBHP Group \u2014 Shares of the Australian mining company rose more than 5% after BHP reported that its total profit for the 2022 fiscal year was $30.9 billion, compared to $11.3 billion in the prior year.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Yun Li, Carmen Reinicke and Jesse Pound contributed reporting.",

More than one in eight UK households fear they have no further way to make cuts to afford a sharp increase in annual energy bills expected this autumn.\n\nDiscounters Aldi and Lidl both increased sales by double-digit percentages in the three months to 7 August as shoppers sought ways to reduce their bills. Kantar found that together Lidl and Aldi have gained 1.8 percentage points of British grocery sales over this period, representing a \u00a32.3bn annual shift in spending. The homegrown discounter Iceland also increased sales by almost 3%.\n\nAldi is close to overtaking Morrisons to become the UK\u2019s fourth largest supermarket. Its market share rose 0.9 percentage points to 9.1%, a fraction behind Morrisons on 9.3%.\n\nWaitrose, Morrisons and independent stores all saw sales fall back, as the overall grocery market rose 2.2% in the three months.\n\nThe summer weather pushed up sales of mineral water, ice-cream and summer clothing, which rose 23%, 18% and 163% respectively.",

                "text": "Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a \"Morning Meeting\" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Tuesday's key moments: We want growth without inflation WMT, HD earnings beats boost retailers Quick mentions: CTRA, DIS, WFC 1. We want growth without inflation Stocks were mixed Tuesday, with tech names keeping a lid on the Nasdaq as bond yields moved higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up for its fifth straight session. West Texas Intermediate crude, the American oil benchmark, fell 2.5%, which bodes well for inflation. Jim Cramer has repeatedly said that he believes oil's peak in June helped cool down inflation in July. While the market and economy have shown promising signs recently, Jim emphasized Tuesday: \"We want growth without inflation. We don't want oil to be too hot.\" 2. WMT, HD earnings beats boost retailers Home Depot (HD) and Walmart (WMT) reported earnings beats before the bell on Tuesday, pushing other retailers' stocks up, including Club holding Costco (COST). While we held positions in both Walmart and Costco earlier this year, we sold off the former after its warnings of excess inventory and the potential impact to its bottom line. Costco, on the other hand, has not faced the same kind of inventory issues. It's also successfully raised prices for some items and held prices steady for others, all while maintaining strong sales. This week is chock-full of other retailers reporting earnings. See a list here . We'll be watching each one as they reveal their financial results, and in turn, provide insights on consumers spending and inflation. 3. Quick mentions: CTRA, DIS, WFC We also have updates on some other Club names. Natural gas soared roughly 5% on Tuesday, spiking to its highest level since late July. This is good news for Club holding Coterra Energy (CTRA), which Jim calls \"the best natural gas company in the country.\" We have reviewed Dan Loeb's recommendations on Disney (DIS), and we believe there's nothing revelatory there. Cost cutting, for example, is something we're sure the company already has on its radar. As for Loeb's urging that Disney spin off ESPN, we believe that while that could be good for the company's bottom-line in the short-term, having a live sports component to its streaming is crucial, especially since it helps differentiate its product from other services like Netflix (NFLX). Banks have been performing well recently, and we believe that the best ones to own right now are Bank of America (BAC) and Club holding Wells Fargo (WFC) for their large deposit bases. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long CTRA, COST, DIS and WFC. See here for a full list of the stocks.) As a subscriber to the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer, you will receive a trade alert before Jim makes a trade. Jim waits 45 minutes after sending a trade alert before buying or selling a stock in his charitable trust's portfolio. If Jim has talked about a stock on CNBC TV, he waits 72 hours after issuing the trade alert before executing the trade.

Nadhim Zahawi said the unemployment rate of 3.8% has rarely been lower in decades and the chancellor is right about that.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the economy continued to create net new jobs in the three months to June, with employment rising by 160,000 over the quarter. Flash estimates suggest the pattern continued into July.\n\nWith job vacancies at near-record levels, the labour market looks in good shape to withstand the recession the Bank of England is forecasting for the UK. The economy contracted slightly in the three months to June, but demand for workers remained strong.\n\nThat\u2019s the upbeat way of looking at the latest jobs figures from the Office for National Statistics. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, says \u201cby any metric the labour market is still very tight\u201d.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The increase in the size of the workforce is being driven by immigration, he notes, with the number of non-UK nationals either working or looking for a job rising by almost 250,000 in the past year.\n\nThe domestic labour force is also likely to increase as people try to maintain their living standards at a time when cost of living pressures are intensifying, and this will lead to higher unemployment as a weakening economy leads to fewer job opportunities.\n\nUltimately, the labour market data shows where the economy has been but doesn\u2019t necessarily show where it is heading. Employment growth was healthy as the UK came out of lockdown. Annual regular pay growth has picked up to 4.7% as firms have struggled to find workers.\n\nThe question is whether those days are now in the past, as the Bank of England certainly thinks. Threadneedle Street sees a protracted recession pushing the unemployment rate to above 6% by 2025. Judging by the most up-to-date evidence, that process has started.",

                "text": "A person removes the nozel from a pump at a gas station on July 29, 2022 in Arlington, Virginia. Olivier Douliery | AFP | Getty Images\n\nYou'd be hard-pressed now to find a recession in the rearview mirror. What's down the road, though, is another story. There is no historical precedent to indicate that an economy in recession can produce 528,000 jobs in a month, as the U.S. did during July. A 3.5% unemployment rate, tied for the lowest since 1969, is not consistent with contraction. But that doesn't mean there isn't a recession ahead, and, ironically enough, it is the labor market's phenomenal resiliency that could pose the broader economy's biggest long-run danger. The Federal Reserve is trying to ease pressures on a historically tight jobs situation and its rapid wage gains in an effort to control inflation running at its highest level in more than 40 years.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is this gives the Fed additional room to continue to tighten, even if it raises the probability of pushing the economy into recession,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \"It's not going to be an easy task to continue to tighten without negative repercussions for the consumer and the economy.\" Indeed, following the robust job numbers, which included a 5.2% 12-month gain for average hourly earnings, traders accelerated their bets on a more aggressive Fed. As of Friday afternoon, markets were assigning about a 69% chance of the central bank enacting its third straight 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike when it meets again in September, according to CME Group data. So while President Joe Biden celebrated the big jobs number on Friday, a much more unpleasant data point could be on the way next week. The consumer price index, the most widely followed inflation measure, comes out Wednesday, and it's expected to show continued upward pressure even with a sharp drop in gasoline prices in July. That will complicate the central bank's balancing act of using rate increases to temper inflation without tipping the economy into recession. As Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at asset management giant BlackRock, said, the challenge is \"how to execute a 'soft landing' when the economy is coming in hot, and is landing on a runway it has never used before.\" \"Today's print, coming in much stronger than anticipated, complicates the job of a Federal Reserve that seeks to engineer a more temperate employment environment, in keeping with its attempts to moderate current levels of inflation,\" Rieder said in a client note. \"The question though now is how much longer (and higher) will rates have to go before inflation can be brought under control?\"\n\nMore recession signs",

                "text": "In this article BBBY\n\nA Bed Bath & Beyond store is seen on June 29, 2022 in Miami, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nBed Bath & Beyond shares soared Tuesday as retail traders active on social media piled into the stock, encouraged by news that GameStop Chairman Ryan Cohen placed another bet on the struggling retailer. Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond skyrocketed more than 70% to an intraday high of $28.04 in midday trading Tuesday amid multiple halts due to volatility. The stock ended the session 29% higher.\n\nLoading chart...\n\nA regulatory filing Monday evening showed that Cohen's venture capital firm RC Ventures bought distant out-of-the-money call options on more than 1.6 million Bed Bath & Beyond shares with strike prices between $60 and $80. Investors profit from calls when the underlying securities rise in prices. The strike price is where the security can be bought by the option holder, meaning Cohen is betting that Bed Bath & Beyond can rise as high as $80 a share. The stock closed Monday at $16. The call options that Cohen bought expire in January 2023.\n\nThe new purchase grabbed the attention of retail traders on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum. The ticker BBBY became the most popular mention in the chat room Tuesday, according to alternative data provider Quiver Quantitative. Trading volumes in Bed Bath & Beyond exploded Tuesday with more than 160 million shares changing hands as of noon ET. The company only has about 80 million shares outstanding, according to a regulatory filing. Cohen first revealed he held a nearly 10% stake in Bed Bath & Beyond through RC Ventures in early March. FactSet says his holdings amounted to 11.82% as of late March. At the time, the GameStop chairman wrote a letter to Bed Bath's then CEO, Mark Tritton, saying he believed the home goods chain was struggling to reverse market share declines and navigate supply chain woes. He also urged the retailer to consider selling its Buybuy Baby chain.",

                "text": "The real value of UK workers\u2019 pay continued to fall at the fastest rate for 20 years in June as wage increases were outstripped by soaring inflation amid the cost of living crisis.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said annual growth in average pay, excluding bonuses, strengthened to 4.7% in the three months to June against a backdrop of low unemployment and high job vacancies.\n\nHowever, the real value of workers\u2019 pay packets dropped by 3% \u2013 the fastest decline since comparable records began in 2001 \u2013 after taking account of its preferred measure of inflation.\n\nGrowth in average earnings including bonuses was 5.1%, although also failed to keep pace with the soaring cost of living.\n\nThe latest snapshot showed early signs of a slowdown in hiring demand among employers despite job vacancies remaining close to a record high. The ONS said unemployment rose slightly to 3.8% in the three months to June, while the number of new job openings fell for the first time since summer 2020.\n\nGrowth in employment slowed to 160,000 in the three months to June, well below analysts\u2019 forecasts, suggesting the jobs market is beginning to cool as Britain\u2019s economic performance falters.\n\nRuth Gregory, a senior UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cJune\u2019s labour market figures revealed further evidence that the weaker economy is leading to a slightly less tight labour market.\u201d\n\nThe chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, said the latest figures showed Britain\u2019s jobs market was in a strong position, with unemployment lower than at almost any point in the past 40 years. \u201c[That is] good news in what I know are difficult times for people,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are delivering a \u00a337bn package of help for households through cash grants and tax cuts so people can keep more of what they earn.\u201d\n\nHowever, the figures underlining the unprecedented hit for workers\u2019 pay are likely to add to the pressure on the government and Conservative leadership candidates amid the cost of living crisis.\n\nLabour said the figures showed the Tories had lost control of the economy. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cThis zombie government is offering no solutions to the cost of living crisis.\u201d\n\nInflation as measured by the consumer price index reached 9.4% in July, the highest rate for 40 years. With a fresh increase in energy bills expected this autumn, the Bank of England forecasts inflation to peak above 13%, alongside a long recession as households rein in their spending.\n\nFrances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the figures showed urgent government action was required to support households ahead of a difficult winter. \u201cThey should cancel the increase to the energy price cap. And they must do far more to get pay rising \u2013 starting with boosting the minimum wage this autumn and giving public sector workers a decent pay rise.\u201d\n\nThe pay data revealed a widening gulf between public and private sector workers, with pay in the private sector rising by 5.9% over the past year, more than three times the 1.8% growth rate in the public sector.\n\nAccording to analysis by the accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, the pay of the richest 1% of workers rose by almost four times the rate of the poorest 10th, highlighting how some households are more insulated from the cost of living crisis than others.\n\nThe Resolution Foundation said the scale of the pay squeeze was deeper than official figures suggest, with the real value of average weekly wages falling by the most since the Queen\u2019s silver jubilee in 1977.\n\nNye Cominetti, a senior economist at the thinktank, said: \u201cThis squeeze has come about despite robust pay growth and a lively jobs market, with pay settlements strengthening slightly, and almost a million people moving jobs in the last three months.\u201d\n\n",

                "text": "\u201cOn the surface, this is good news for the Fed,\u201d said Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights. \u201cThis is the first baby step toward the moderation they want to see on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nInflation F.A.Q. Card 1 of 5 Inflation F.A.Q. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. Inflation F.A.Q. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Inflation F.A.Q. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. Inflation F.A.Q. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Inflation F.A.Q. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFed officials remain committed to wrestling America\u2019s rapid inflation lower, and they have raised interest rates at the quickest pace since the 1980s to try to slow the economy and bring supply and demand into balance \u2014 making supersize rate moves of three-quarters of a percentage point at each of their past two meetings. Another big adjustment will be up for debate at their next meeting in September, policymakers have said.\n\nBut investors interpreted July\u2019s unexpectedly pronounced inflation slowdown as a sign that policymakers could take a gentler route, raising rates a half-point next month. Stocks soared more than 2 percent on Wednesday, as Wall Street bet that the Fed might become less aggressive, which would decrease the chances that it would plunge the economy into a recession.\n\n\u201cIt was as good as the markets and the Fed could have hoped for from this report,\u201d said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies. \u201cI do think it removes the urgency for the Fed.\u201d\n\nStill, officials who spoke on Wednesday remained cautious about inflation. Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, called the report the \u201cfirst hint\u201d of a move in the right direction, while Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that it was \u201cpositive\u201d but that price increases remained \u201cunacceptably high.\u201d\n\nPolicymakers have been hoping for more than a year that price increases will begin to cool, only to have those expectations repeatedly dashed. Supply chain issues have made goods more expensive, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sent commodity prices soaring, a shortage of workers pushed wages and service prices higher and a dearth of housing has fueled rising rents.",

                "text": "In this article CMCSA\n\nMark Hoffman, Chairman of CNBC\n\nMark Hoffman, CNBC's president since 2005 and chairman since 2015, announced Tuesday he will step down on Sept. 12. Hoffman is leaving of his own accord. NBCUniversal hired Cesar Conde to oversee NBC News, MSNBC and CNBC in May 2020 to bring more centralized leadership to the group. KC Sullivan will return to replace Hoffman as CNBC's new president. Sullivan has spent the last two years as president and managing director of NBCUniversal's global advertising and partnerships, based in London. Before that, he was president and managing director of CNBC International and CNBC's chief financial officer.\n\nSullivan will return to the U.S. for his new role. Hoffman will stay on as a consultant through the transition, Conde wrote in a note to NBCUniversal employees. \"Mark has overseen the steady continued growth of CNBC as the world's #1 business and money news brand,\" Conde said. \"No business news organization comes close to the reach and influence of CNBC, a true testament to Mark's leadership.\" CNBC is one of NBCUniversal's most consistently profitable assets, even as millions of Americans drop linear cable TV subscriptions each year. Hoffman, 65, has increased profitability at CNBC in 16 of his 17 years running the company. CNBC is set to grow its profitability again in 2022, according to a person familiar with the matter. \"We are in the business of business so it's important to note we've never been more profitable, setting record after record in financial performance, year after year, as we maneuvered through economic cycles, exogenous events and the historic secular change that accompanied the information age,\" Hoffman said in a note to CNBC employees.\n\nHoffman's CNBC tenure\n\nHoffman first joined CNBC in 1997 before leaving in 2001 for a series of leadership positions at local TV stations. He returned to CNBC in 2005 and immediately pushed to acquire 50% equity interests in CNBC Europe and CNBC Asia from Dow Jones, as well as a 25% stake in CNBC World. With financial control over its international properties, Hoffman expanded CNBC's TV reach and turned his attention to growing CNBC's digital business. CNBC.com has grown sixfold in the past six years, with unique monthly readership growing from about 30 million to nearly 200 million.",

            "newsTextAndEnts": {
                "text": "There was an amusing interlude during BP\u2019s announcement of bumper profits earlier this month when the chief executive, Bernard Looney, was asked what he planned to do with the \u00a3400 rebate on his energy bill that would arrive courtesy of the cost of living support package that Rishi Sunak, then chancellor, announced in May. Looney appeared unaware that he, like everybody else in the UK, would get the discount automatically from October. It was only later that BP offered the PR-friendly answer that its \u00a34.4m-a-year boss would make a donation to charity.\n\nLooney\u2019s bafflement was understandable. High earners like him (and, indeed, high earners collecting considerably less) obviously don\u2019t need assistance from the state in paying their energy bills this winter. There was no sound economic reason for Sunak to add a universally applied \u00a3400 element to a package that was otherwise rightly concentrated on vulnerable households, meaning those most affected by higher bills.\n\nThat point, bizarrely, seems to have been lost on Sir Keir Starmer. The Labour leader has opted to back the most untargeted form of support this winter \u2013 a plan to freeze the price of energy for all consumers, rich and poor alike, at its current level for six months.\n\nThe idea is popular, we\u2019re told, because three out of four Tory voters support it. In that sense, it may represent smart politics; the next prime minister will be under pressure to adopt chunks of the proposal, including the increase in the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers. But the economics of freezing energy prices for all households, as opposed to only those least able to afford higher prices, makes little sense.\n\nStarmer\u2019s scheme has the virtue of simplicity, it could be argued \u2013 and, yes, the plan is costed if one accepts the \u00a37bn fiddle with the effect of temporarily reduced inflation-related payments on government debt. But a programme that costs \u00a330bn for six months becomes vastly expensive if it has to be repeated for as long as wholesale prices remain high \u2013 a timeframe that is currently unknowable. If the Looney household and others didn\u2019t need Sunak\u2019s \u00a3400 discount, they definitely don\u2019t require the average \u00a31,000 saving that Labour\u2019s proposal would deliver.\n\nMore to the point, artificially holding down prices for everybody undermines the incentive on wealthier households to reduce their energy consumption, an imperative that ought to be front and centre of any national plan to get through the emergency. Starmer is also talking the language of more insulation in homes, but artificially underpricing a scarce resource does nothing to encourage consumers to turn down their boiler settings in the short term, use their spin dryers less, and so on. \u201cSuppressing the price signal is only going to increase the likelihood that we run out of energy this winter,\u201d says one independent energy analyst, Peter Atherton. Exactly right.\n\nOne can argue all day about how to define a high-earning household that doesn\u2019t need support from the public purse, but a means-tested approach of some form still seems the best way to proceed. It would be fairer, more financially sustainable in the long term and more likely to change behaviour. Labour\u2019s plan has got off on the wrong foot; support should be targeted.\n\nHeathrow seems to have redefined success\n\nThe way the Heathrow chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, tells it, imposing a cap on the number of flights at the airport has been a complete triumph. Limiting the number of departing passengers to 100,000 a day since July has delivered fewer last-minute flight cancellations, better take-off punctuality and shorter waits for bags, the airport was boasting only last week.\n\nSo, having bought time to regroup and focus, is Heathrow now in a position to resume a normal schedule in time for the next surge in demand that will arrive with the October half-term holiday? Actually, no. The airport is extending the cap until 29 October for the same reason: that it needs to support \u201cmore reliable and resilient passenger journeys\u201d.\n\nAn extension is probably sensible if Heathrow \u2013 or the ground-handling firms it usually blames during episodes of chaos \u2013 still haven\u2019t got the necessary resources in place. But let\u2019s not miss the wider picture. Being bounced into capping the number of passengers was a spectacular failure of management that flowed from the under-estimation of the speed of the recovery in demand. Taking even longer to fix the problem is not a success.",

After more than two years of exercising caution, many people took longer trips this summer, which is typically the busiest season for air travel. At the same time, many airlines cut the number of flights on their summer schedules to reduce the risk of mass delays and cancellations because of weather and staffing problems especially around holidays and other peak travel days.

The unemployment rate is now back to its pre-pandemic level and tied for the lowest since 1969, though the rate for Blacks rose 0.2 percentage point to 6%.\n\nWage growth also surged higher, as average hourly earnings jumped 0.5% for the month and 5.2% from the same time a year ago. Those numbers add fuel to an inflation picture that already has consumer prices rising at their fastest rate since the early 1980s. The Dow Jones estimate was for a 0.3% monthly gain and 4.9% annual increase.\n\nMore broadly, though, the report showed the labor market remains strong despite other signs of economic weakness.\n\n\"There's no way to take the other side of this. There's not a lot of, 'Yeah, but,' other than it's not positive from a market or Fed perspective,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. \"For the economy, this is good news.\"\n\nMarkets initially reacted negatively to the report as traders anticipated a strong counter move from a Federal Reserve looking to cool the economy and in particular a heated labor market. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day positive, rising about 74 points following a day of choppy trading.\n\nLeisure and hospitality led the way in job gains with 96,000, though the industry is still 1.2 million workers shy of its pre-pandemic level.\n\nProfessional and business services was next with 89,000. Health care added 70,000 and government payrolls grew 57,000. Goods-producing industries also posted solid gains, with construction up 32,000 and manufacturing adding 30,000.\n\nRetail jobs increased by 22,000, despite repeated warnings from executives at Walmart, Target and elsewhere that consumer demand is shifting.\n\nA more encompassing view of unemployment that includes those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons as well as discouraged workers not looking for jobs was unchanged at 6.7%.",

However, the number of customer transactions fell during the quarter. Home Depot moved between gains and losses in premarket trading.\n\nWalmart (WMT) \u2013 Walmart rallied 3.4% in premarket trading after reporting better-than-expected top and bottom line results for the second quarter.

Retail sales rose by 2.7% from a year ago, again significantly below expectations, as China\u2019s economic recovery from pandemic lockdowns earlier this year showed signs of fizzling out.\n\nChina\u2019s economy narrowly escaped a contraction in the second quarter, hobbled by the lockdown of the commercial hub of Shanghai and a deepening downturn in the property market, as well as persistently weaker levels of consumer spending.\n\nThe country\u2019s property sector, rocked by a mortgage boycott as thousands of homebuyers refuse to keep up with payments on unfinished flats bought off plan, also weakened in July.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Energy traders are also eyeing the potential for a nuclear deal between Iran and western negotiators that could pave the way for an increase in the supply of oil.\n\nThe global oil price has dropped from a peak close to $140 in March, when concerns over supplies from Russia reached their height. However, prices are still historically high as the war in Ukraine continues, at almost 50% above levels seen at the end of 2019.\n\nSoaring energy prices have been the biggest driver of high inflation in the UK and other advanced economies amid the worsening cost of living crisis.\n\nBjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at the Swedish bank SEB, said it was clear that weakness in Chinese oil demand was one of the main reasons why oil prices had fallen back since early June.\n\n\u201cThere is little hope that China will change its Covid-19 stance anytime soon and there is a high risk that Chinese demand weakness persists amid continued rolling lockdowns from month to month,\u201d he said.",

According to figures from consultancy firm CGA, the average cost of a pint has risen from \u00a32.30 in 2008 to \u00a33.95 in 2022, though prices vary drastically across locations. Average prices rose by 15 pence between 2021 and 2022, up almost 4%, one of the largest year-on-year increases since 2008. The average price of a pint at one unnamed pub in London hit an eye-watering \u00a38.06 this year, the highest CGA has ever recorded, while the lowest nationally was a \u00a31.79 average at a pub in Lancashire, in the northwest of England. U.K. inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.4% in June and is expected to rise beyond 13% in October, compounding the country's historic cost-of-living crisis and prompting the Bank of England to implement its largest interest rate hike since 1995 on Thursday. Many pubs and hospitality venues are concerned that consumers will increasingly stay at home. Paul Bolton, client director for GB drinks at CGA, told CNBC that a combination of supply chain issues, staffing shortages, soaring energy costs, lingering pandemic-era debts and generally high inflation are increasing suppliers' cost pressures, which then have to be passed onto the consumer. Raw materials and energy Francois Sonneville, senior beverage analyst at Rabobank, told CNBC that prices are increasing throughout the value chain, starting with barley. \"The barley price has gone up, and has doubled since 2021. There's two reasons for that: one is that the harvest in North America was really poor, driven by a poor climate, so there was not much inventory to start with \u2013 and then, of course, we had the Black Sea region conflict,\" he told CNBC's Arabile Gumede.\n\nA pint of Adnams Ghost Ship Citrus pale Ale.

Our chemical inputs are going up and just the cost of running machinery, whether it's spare parts or actually just the cost of buying machinery itself. All that has gone up an awful lot more than the 9 or 10% of normal inflation.\"\n\nHowever, barley is not the main cost incurred during the brewing process \u2013 in fact, it only contributes around 5% of the price of beer at the tap. The biggest costs, analysts and business leaders told CNBC, come from labor, packaging and energy. \"I think that if you look at the brewing process itself, it uses a lot of energy \u2013 and the energy price has gone up, as we all know, when we stop at the pump \u2013 but the most important one is probably packaging,\" Sonneville said. \"Packaging makes up about 25 to 30% of the cost price of beer, and glass packaging, glass bottles, use about 25% of their cost in energy, so with gas prices going 10 times higher now than they were two years ago, that has a massive impact on the cost of a brewer.\" Labor of love His comments were echoed by Andy Wood, CEO of Suffolk-based brewery and hospitality business Adnams, who told CNBC that the energy price increases the company is seeing are \"absolutely eye-watering.\" \"Brewing beer or distilling spirits involves a lot of boiling water, so that involves lots of energy to get to that state, although we've put quite a number of innovations in over the years to limit the impact of that,\" he explained. Wood said in the aftermath of Brexit and the pandemic, a tightening of the U.K. labor market is also exerting upward wage pressure, which will likely be exacerbated by the country's escalating cost-of-living crisis. \"The biggest cost that we have is our payroll because the hospitality part of that business is a people-driven business,\" he added. What's more, the geopolitical headwinds facing businesses throughout the supply chain are unlikely to abate any time soon.\n\n\"So we've got Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we've got the energy crisis that that's brought on, we've got the food supply crisis, grain, cooking oils, these types of things, and then \u2026 we hear in the media that China may be looking longingly at Taiwan, so I think the geopolitical situation is getting no easier, so I think these things are here to stay,\" he said. The question for businesses, according to both Wood and Sonneville, is how many of these costs they can absorb, how much should be passed onto consumers, and in the midst of a cost of living crisis, how to sustain margins without forcing the consumer to stay at home and jeopardizing volumes. Brewers tend to have long-term contracts and hedges in place to ensure contingency plans for future price rises, meaning not all of their costs are fully reflected at present, and therefore not immediately passed onto consumers. \"I think if you look at the price of beer that you and I pay, there is a risk that that will go higher, because there is a lagging effect of costs at the brewery because of those long-term contracts,\" Sonneville said on Monday. \"The hope that I think is there at brewers is that prices will come down. We have not seen that in gas \u2014 we've seen more sanctions there and gas prices have actually risen in the last three days \u2014 but we have seen that grain prices have come off a little bit, and the hope is that that will continue.\" Shifting trends Wood noted that consumer sentiment and behavior had already begun to shift in the face of higher prices at the bar. \"We're certainly seeing people come out earlier in the evening, having their drinks, having their dinner, and then they're going back home,\" he said. \"We're seeing people perhaps having two courses rather than three courses, and perhaps having a glass of wine rather than a bottle of wine, so we are seeing some changes in consumer behavior, there is no doubt about that.\" This was reflected in CGA's latest consumer analysis, which found that premium products and venues offering particularly unique experiences were increasing their share of the on-trade.",

Monday\u2019s steep oil price decline exactly matched the previous post-invasion low, which was reached on 5 August. Brent prices peaked on 7 March at $139.13 when concerns over supplies from Russia reached their height.

Photograph: Refinitiv It is a similar story for West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, which hit a low of $86.82, the lowest since 3 February.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.22 Closing summary: Poorer UK households to cut back three times more than rich this winter Oil prices are on track for their biggest one-day decline in a fortnight as investors try to work out whether China\u2019s economic weakness will persist \u2013 and cause a drop in demand. Brent crude oil futures prices reached the joint-lowest level since February, while West Texas Intermediate set a new low. Falling energy prices would be a blessing to economies around the world in the short term as they struggle with the political and financial implications of inflation, but $90 for a barrel of oil is still pretty high in historical terms. It is likely to be the poorest households who bear the most pain when bills rise in the winter. In the UK the energy price cap is expected to rise above \u00a34,200 for an average annual bill in January. New analysis by the Resolution Foundation suggests that the poorest fifth of households will have to cut their discretionary spending by more than a fifth to make up for the energy price increase. Even the richest households will have to tighten their belts. Poorer UK households will have to reduce their spending by more than a fifth to pay for energy bills. Photograph: Resolution Foundation That will mean a lot of products and services that are not bought. Little wonder that economists are bracing for recession in the UK and elsewhere \u2013 and little wonder that it is likely to be the key political issue for the contenders to be UK prime minister. The Resolution Foundation\u2019s Mike Brewer, Karl Handscomb, and Jonathan Marshall wrote: This winter, low-income households will have to reduce their spending by three times as much as high-income households in order to afford their energy bills \u2013 a situation that is particularly concerning now that we know energy bills in January-March 2023 are set to be an annualised \u00a34,266, rather than the \u00a32,800 expected earlier this year.

It appears traders across the Atlantic also have their eye on a possible Chinese slowdown. Here are the opening snaps, via Reuters: S&P 500 DOWN 22.85 POINTS, OR 0.53%, AT 4,257.30 AFTER MARKET OPEN\n\nNASDAQ DOWN 50.98 POINTS, OR 0.39%, AT 12,996.20 AFTER MARKET OPEN\n\nDOW JONES DOWN 171.96 POINTS, OR 0.51%, AT 33,589.09 AFTER MARKET OPEN\n\n\n\n4d ago 14.25 Oil prices fall to lowest level since before Russia invaded Ukraine The latest dip has pushed Brent crude oil, the North Sea benchmark, to a low of $92.78: that is the joint lowest level since before Vladimir Putin ordered the start of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Monday\u2019s steep oil price decline exactly matched the previous post-invasion low, which was reached on 5 August. Brent prices peaked on 7 March at $139.13 when concerns over supplies from Russia reached their height. They have remained above $100 for most of the time since then \u2013 a level rarely seen in history. Brent crude oil futures prices reached their lowest point since 21 February on Monday. Photograph: Refinitiv It is a similar story for West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, which hit a low of $86.82, the lowest since 3 February.\n\n\n\n4d ago 13.37 Oil prices down by $5 after weak Chinese data sparks concerns Chinese industrial production was lower than expected by economists in July. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images The latest check-in on oil prices: prices have dropped by as much as $5. That\u2019s a pretty chunky move for a single day (although things can be magnified in mid-August when a lot of traders are lying on beaches, meaning fewer sellers can have an outsized impact). The new low for the day for Brent crude futures prices is $93.03. That is really not far off the nearly six-month low ($92.78) set just before Russia invaded Ukraine. It is 5.1% down, or $5, for the day. A persistent drop in energy prices would be welcome news for households around the world, who are struggling with inflation. However, it remains to be seen whether a durable decline will be delivered. And it should also be noted that the reason for the decline is not exactly a short-term positive: traders are looking at the global economy and thinking about recessions in several of the biggest economies. That was sparked by weak Chinese data earlier this morning: Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, explains: It is becoming quite clear that weakness in Chinese oil demand is one of the main reasons for the steady decline in oil prices since early June. Chinese crude oil imports were below 9m barrels per day in both June and July and oil demand is no higher today than it was in October 2019. There is little hope that China will change its Covid-19 stance anytime soon and there is a high risk that Chinese demand weakness persists amid continued rolling lock-downs from month to month. A normalisation of Chinese oil demand at some point in time will be extremely bullish for oil prices, but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to happen anytime soon.\n\n\n\n4d ago 12.00 Nationwide to pay \u00a31,200 to lower-paid staff as cost of living bonus Nationwide will pay more than 11,000 a bonus to cover increased living costs. Photograph: Maureen McLean/REX/Shutterstock Nationwide Building Society will pay more than 11,000 of its staff \u00a31,200 to help them cope with Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis. The offer will be made to staff making less than \u00a335,000, or about 61% of Nationwide\u2019s workforce of 18,000 people, said Nationwide, a mutual owned by its customers. The building society has already raised pay by 4% earlier this year, but with inflation expected to reach 13% by the Bank of England that would result in a steep real-terms pay cut. A bonus would address some of this pay rise, but with the advantage for the business of not locking in a higher wage bill. The company\u2019s press release makes it very clear the bonus is a \u201cone off\u201d. HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest and the UK arm of Santander have all announced similar bonuses. Debbie Crosbie, Nationwide\u2019s chief executive, said: The months ahead will be worrying for many people and we\u2019re always considering new ways to help our members. But rising prices affect our colleagues too and that\u2019s why we\u2019re providing this additional support.\n\n\n\n4d ago 11.33 Every time you look at oil prices this morning it seems like they have lost more ground. The new low for Brent crude today is $93.54, down $4.60 today or 4.7%. The post-invasion low is $92.78. That\u2019s still 70 cents away, but after today\u2019s drop that suddenly doesn\u2019t look implausible.\n\n\n\n4d ago 11.15 Today\u2019s commodity price sell-off is giving a good case study of the importance of mining and oil companies to the FTSE 100. London\u2019s benchmark index is the only one of Europe\u2019s main markets to have dipped into the red this morning. Europe may have its fair share of old economy stalwarts (compared to the US\u2019s tech-heavy stock benchmarks), but the FTSE 100 is uniquely exposed to commodities among its peers (and that\u2019s even after a giant steel company, Evraz, was suspended because it was owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, who is under UK sanctions). The FTSE 100 was the only major European index in the red on Monday morning. Photograph: Refinitiv\n\n\n\n4d ago 10.52 Oil isn\u2019t the only commodity under pressure. The benchmark LME nickel contract dropped more than 3% this morning, silver is down 2.3%, platinum has fallen 2.6%. That commodity sell-off has dragged back the FTSE 100. It is just about in the red, with miners Antofagasta, Anglo American and Rio Tinto plus supermajor oil companies Shell and BP among the 10 biggest fallers. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at trading platform OANDA, said: The figures from China really are a concern and the authorities have a big job on their hands arresting flagging domestic demand. That doesn\u2019t bode well for oil demand especially when the country remains so committed to zero-Covid. And with cases continuing to rise, the downward pressure on oil prices could intensify. Throw in a deal between the US and Iran and we may be able to wave goodbye to triple-digit oil prices for a while. Of course, it doesn\u2019t matter how close the two are, a deal can never be assumed to be done until it\u2019s signed. If it does get over the line, we could see oil slip below $90 and perhaps even stay there.\n\n\n\n4d ago 10.35 And just like that Brent crude oil prices have dropped by more than a dollar: as I write it\u2019s at $94.67. That\u2019s a $3.40 drop for today, or 3.6%. Oil prices dropped steeply on Monday morning. Photograph: Refinitiv The most obvious cause appears to be jitters caused by China\u2019s weak economic data. A major slowdown would likely drag back demand for oil.\n\n\n\n4d ago 10.22 And here is a reminder of what an energy crisis can do: Kosovo is starting intermittent power cuts because it is too expensive to import energy. \u201cConsumers will have six hours on and two hours off,\u201d a spokesman for Kosovo\u2019s energy distribution company, KEDS, told Reuters. Kosovo relies almost exclusively on coal (which is also very polluting) but consumption of up to 800 megawatts (MW) is far outstripping supply of 500MW. Reuters reports: In a statement on Sunday, KEDS said that it and the country\u2019s transmission system operator, KOSTT, could not afford to import electricity and must rely on domestic production. About 90% of the country\u2019s electricity production is from coal, and the power utility KEK has said it had shut down almost half of its generators for regular maintenance to prepare them for winter.\n\n\n\n4d ago 10.09 Oil prices have dipped further: the price of a barrel of Brent crude for October delivery is now at $96.07 \u2013 $2 down for the day. Prices are near their lowest level since markets reacted to Russia ratcheting up tension with Ukraine ahead of its invasion. The lowest point this month on 5 August was below $93, a level not seen since 21 February, three days before Vladimir Putin ordered the start of the invasion. Oil prices fell near on Monday following surprise weakness in Chinese economic data, remaining near the lowest levels since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Photograph: Refinitiv The price of West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, has also fallen further: futures prices are down 2.3%, or $2.11, to just under $90 per barrel.\n\n\n\n4d ago 09.36 The then UK chancellor Rishi Sunak (now in the race to be prime minister against Liz Truss) told MPs in February that the government\u2019s aim was to make up for half the cost of energy price increases to households. In May, the government updated the support to be worth \u00a324bn. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) lays out the \u201cfive main strands\u201d: \u00a3400 to all households labelled as an \u201cenergy discount\u201d that will be subtracted from energy bills.\n\n\u00a3150 for all households in council tax bands A-D (around 80% of households).\n\n\u00a3650 for any family on means-tested benefits.\n\n\u00a3300 for pensioners on means-tested benefits.\n\n\u00a3150 for those on a disability benefit. That meant that the government was covering about three-quarters of the \u00a333bn increase in energy bills that was expected then, in May. The problem is that costs have continued to surge since then, to the point that bills are expected to more than double from already elevated levels come the winter. The consultancy Cornwall Insights forecasts that bills could rise to \u00a34,266 in January and \u00a34,426 in April before easing somewhat \u2013 but will remain elevated until we see a proper decline in wholesale prices. Given the cap is currently \u00a31,971, it is easy to see how the price of keeping support at the same level starts to stack up.\n\nUpdated at 09.42 BST\n\n4d ago 08.48 Another \u00a312bn needed to keep UK energy bills support at same level, says IFS Mark Sweney The government needs to spend another \u00a312bn to maintain the scale of support pledged to help families cope with the cost of living crisis as the energy prices continue to soar, according to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). The economics thinktank said that the additional funding will be needed to achieve the \u00a324bn package of aid announced in May, largely because the forecast increase in energy prices over the next year has jumped from 95% to 141%. This means that working age benefit claimants are now on course to see their real income fall by \u00a3620 over the year. The IFS says that the government would need to double the current \u00a3650 grant to those on benefits to protect them, as well as help low income pensioners and families in work, at a cost of \u00a35.5bn. Similarly, the cost of maintaining the \u00a3150 council tax rebate and \u00a3400 energy discount will now cost the government another \u00a37bn if it wants to continue to cover around half the increase in costs a typical family will be hit by over the year. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said: As prices of essentials including food, heating and fuel continues to rise, families on low-incomes are facing more uncertainty and pressures. The government is still playing catch up as inflation and the cost of energy continue to spiral upwards. Just achieving what they wanted to achieve back in May will cost an additional \u00a312bn, and a package on that scale will still leave many households much worse off.\n\n\n\n4d ago 08.25 The FTSE 100 has gained 0.3% in the first minutes of trading in this mid-August week, hitting its highest point since early June. The top gainer is RS Group, formerly known as Electrocomponents, amid speculation that it could be in line for a takeover bid. Pharma group AstraZeneca has gained 2.5% after it said that its breast cancer drug Enhertu had shown positive trial results. Elsewhere in Europe stocks are looking positive.

We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause.

Democrats have faced a bleak outlook heading into the fall, with Mr. Biden suffering from dismal approval numbers amid soaring inflation and painful prices at the pump.\n\nMr. Biden is planning to sign a bill on Wednesday that would expand medical care for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits on military bases, another measure that Congress approved with bipartisan support. And on Friday, the House is expected to pass the climate, health and tax bill that cleared the Senate over the weekend, handing the president a legislative triumph that he and Democratic candidates can highlight in the weeks to come.\n\nThe effort to promote the recent series of victories comes after Mr. Biden was forced to isolate during a bout with Covid-19, followed by a rebound case. He left isolation on Sunday and then traveled on Monday to meet with survivors of the severe flooding in Kentucky, his first work trip since testing positive for the virus on July 21.",

Because we're not just dealing with economic issues like inflation and lapping stimulus and things like that. But also the social issues of people returning to mobility after lockdown, working from home and just the change in consumer patterns.\"\n\nThree months earlier, during the company's prior call with analysts, Gibbs said economists who call this a \"K-shaped recovery,\" where high-income consumers are doing fine while lower-income householders struggle, are oversimplifying the situation.\n\n\"I don't know in my career we've seen a more complex environment to analyze consumer behavior than what we're dealing with right now,\" he said in May, citing inflation, rising wages and federal stimulus spending that's still stoking the economy.\n\nAt the same time, societal issues like the post-Covid reopening and Russia's war in Ukraine are weighing on consumer sentiment, which all \"makes for a pretty complex environment to figure out how to analyze it and market to consumers,\" Gibbs said.\n\nGibbs is right. Things are very strange. Is a recession coming or not?\n\nThere is ample evidence for the \"yes\" camp.\n\nTech and finance are bracing for a downturn with hiring slowdowns and job cuts and pleas for more efficiency from workers. The stock market has been on a nine-month slump with the tech-heavy Nasdaq off more than 20% from its November peak and many high-flying tech stocks down 60% or more.\n\nInflation is causing consumers to spend less on nonessential purchases like clothing so they can afford gas and food.

Already, there are signs that poorer families are cutting back. If richer families don\u2019t pull back as much \u2014 if they keep going on vacations, dining out and buying new cars and second homes \u2014 many prices could keep rising.

                "text": "Initial claims for unemployment insurance totaled 260,000 last week, near the highest level since November amid a shift in the U.S. labor market. The total for the week ended July 30 was in line with the Dow Jones estimate but a gain of 6,000 from the previous week's downwardly revised level, the Labor Department reported Thursday. In other economic news, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services decreased to $79.6 billion in June, down $5.3 billion and slightly lower than the estimate for $80 billion. The jobless claims number comes a day before the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its much anticipated nonfarm payrolls report for July. That is expected the show the U.S. economy added 258,000 positions in the month, compared with the 372,000 initial June estimate and the lowest total since December 2020.\n\nA sign for hire is posted on the window of a Chipotle restaurant in New York, April 29, 2022. Shannon Stapleton | Reuters\n\n\"The labor market remains in good shape as the summer quarter progresses but the rise in initial claims since early April is a cold breeze blowing at the hot labor market this summer,\" said Stuart Hoffman, senior economic advisor at PNC Financial Services. Federal Reserve officials are watching the jobs market closely for clues about an economy that is showing the highest inflation rate in more than 40 years. Jobless claims had been running around their lowest levels since the late 1960s but started ticking higher in June as inflation pressures swelled and companies started cutting back on hires. Even with robust hiring in 2021 and the first half of 2022, the total employment level is 755,000 below where it was in February 2020, the last month before the Covid pandemic hit. The four-week moving average of jobless claims, which smooths out weekly volatility, reflects the shift in the jobs market. That number rose 6,000 from the previous week to 254,750, up sharply from the recent low of 170,500 on April 2 and the highest level of the year. Continuing claims, which run a week behind the headline number, totaled 1.42 million, up 48,000 from the prior week and 83,000 from the beginning of July.\n\nTrade deficit comes off record high",

                "text": "Some other shifts caused by the pandemic are likely to prove longer lasting. But it is hard for businesses to know which.\n\n\u201cI think businesses are correct that the current state of the economy can\u2019t really hold \u2014 something has to give,\u201d Mr. Ozimek said.\n\nTo most people, of course, this doesn\u2019t feel like a boom. Measures of consumer confidence are at record lows, and Americans overwhelmingly say they are dissatisfied with the economy. That perception is grounded in reality: High inflation is eroding \u2014 and in some cases erasing \u2014 the benefits of a strong job market for many workers. Hourly earnings, adjusted for inflation, are falling at their fastest pace in decades.\n\n\u201cI know people will hear today\u2019s extraordinary jobs report and say they don\u2019t see it, they don\u2019t feel it in their own lives,\u201d President Biden said Friday. \u201cI know how hard it is. I know it\u2019s hard to feel good about job creation when you already have a job and you\u2019re dealing with rising prices \u2014 food and gas and so much more. I get it.\u201d\n\nTara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University, said the United States wasn\u2019t experiencing a true boom. That would imply a virtuous circle, in which prosperity begets investment, which begets more prosperity and makes the economy more productive in the long term \u2014 a rising tide that lifts all boats.\n\nInstead, the lingering disruptions of the pandemic, uncertainty over what the post-Covid economy will look like and fears of a recession have made businesses reluctant to make bets on the future. Business investment fell in the most recent quarter. Employers are hiring, but they are leaning heavily on one-time bonuses rather than permanent pay increases.",

The employment picture over the past six months is behaving nothing like an economy in a downturn, instead creating jobs at a rapid pace of nearly 460,000 a month. Research from CNBC's Steve Liesman indicates that during a typical downturn, the employment picture would be far gloomier, losing ground instead of gaining. Several charts presented during Wednesday's \"Squawk Box\" help paint the picture. The CNBC team looked at economic data going back to 1947. It indicated that when gross domestic product has been negative for six months, as is the case for 2022, payrolls fall by an average of 0.5 percentage point. But this year, the job count actually has increased by 1%.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards CNBC\n\nData from human relations software company UKG backs up that notion, with internal data that shows jobs have been created about in line with the Bureau of Labor Statistics' count.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nFinally, the Dallas Federal Reserve, in research posted Tuesday, said its analysis of multiple data points found \"that most indicators \u2014 particularly those measuring labor markets \u2014 provide strong evidence that the U.S. economy did not fall into a recession in the first quarter\" of the year. One data point the central bank's researchers looked at was real personal consumption expenditures. They found that consumption generally declined during recessions. By contrast, the measure increased during the first half of 2022.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards",

It's a buffered ETF using a risk reversal strategy to minimize downside while also putting a cap on gains.\n\n\"You buy TSLH, hedge Tesla, you get basically 10% on the upside, and you have a 10% floor,\" Bond explained on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" last week. \"Now what a floor is \u2013 that's a max loss of 10%.

If it goes down 50%, you lose 10%.\"\n\nTreasury bills make up about 90% of the hedged fund \"to construct a potential floor against significant losses on a quarterly basis,\" Innovator ETFs reported in the ETF launch news release. \"A call option spread on TSLA using FLEX options\" makes up the remainder of the fund's portfolio.\n\n\"The projected upside cap for the balance of the current calendar quarter (through September) is 8.70%,\" the company also said.\n\nIts floor resets each calendar quarter but will never surpass 10%, Bond explained to CNBC, noting the ETF's floor rested at 9.23% when it launched.\n\nThe Innovator Hedged TSLA Strategy ETF is up 5% since its launch on July 26. Meanwhile, Tesla shares are up 12% in the same time period.\n\nIt's not the first time Bond's company launched an ETF using this risk reversal strategy.\n\nInnovator ETFs started the Innovator Defined Wealth Shield ETF (BALT) last year that focusing the S&P 500 index.\n\nBut the strategy is under fire by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler released a statement not long after addressing risks that may stem from \"complex\" exchange-traded products such as leveraged or inverse ETFs, emphasizing potential issues with their short-term nature.\n\n\"These ETPs, however, can pose risks even to sophisticated investors, and can potentially create system-wide risks by operating in unanticipated ways when markets experience volatility or stress conditions,\" Gensler's Oct. 2021 statement said,\n\nGensler proposed \"potential rulemaking\" to help protect individual investors. However, Bond defended Innovator ETFs' products, suggesting buffers offer significant risk control value.\n\nThe SEC declined to provide a statement.",

                "text": "Passengers at an American Airlines gate at the Dallas/Fort Worth International airport in Dallas. Scott Mlyn | CNBC\n\nIt wasn't long ago that Amazon, Shopify and Peloton doubled their workforces to manage through the pandemic surge, while Morgan Stanley staffed up to handle a record level of IPOs, and mortgage lenders added headcount as rock-bottom rates led to a refinancing boom. On the flipside, Delta Air Lines, Hilton Worldwide and legions of restaurants slashed headcount because of lockdowns that rolled through much of the country and other parts of the world. Now, they're scrambling to reverse course. Companies that hired like crazy in 2020 and 2021 to meet customer demand are being forced to make sweeping cuts or impose hiring freezes with a possible recession on the horizon. In a matter of months, CEOs have gone from hypergrowth mode to concerns over \"macroeconomic uncertainty,\" a phrase investors have heard many times on second-quarter earnings calls. Stock trading app Robinhood and crypto exchange Coinbase both recently slashed more than 1,000 jobs after their splashy market debuts in 2021. Meanwhile, airlines, hotels and eateries face the opposite problem as their businesses continue to pick up following the era of Covid-induced shutdowns. After instituting mass layoffs early in the pandemic, they can't hire quickly enough to satisfy demand and are dealing with a labor market radically different from the one they experienced over two years ago, before the cutbacks. \"The pandemic created very unique, once-in-a-lifetime conditions in many different industries that caused a dramatic reallocation of capital,\" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at job recruiting site ZipRecruiter. \"Many of those conditions no longer apply so you're seeing a reallocation of capital back to more normal patterns.\"\n\nFor employers, those patterns are particularly challenging to navigate, because inflation levels have jumped to a 40-year high, and the Fed has lifted its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point on consecutive occasions for the first time since the early 1990s. The central bank's efforts to tamp down inflation have raised concerns that the U.S. economy is headed for recession. Gross domestic product has fallen for two straight quarters, hitting a widely accepted rule of thumb for recession, though the National Bureau of Economic Research hasn't yet made that declaration. The downward trend was bound to happen eventually, and market experts lamented the frothiness in stock prices and absurdity of valuations as late as the fourth quarter of last year, when the major indexes hit record highs led by the riskiest assets. That was never more evident than in November, when electric vehicle maker Rivian went public on almost no revenue and quickly reached a market cap of over $150 billion. Bitcoin hit a record the same day, touching close to $69,000. Since then, bitcoin is off by two-thirds, and Rivian has lost about 80% of its value. In July, the car company started layoffs of about 6% of its workforce. Rivian's headcount almost quintupled to around 14,000 between late 2020 and mid-2022.\n\nTech layoffs and an air of caution\n\nJob cuts and hiring slowdowns were big talking points on tech earnings calls last week. Amazon reduced its headcount by 99,000 people to 1.52 million employees at the end of the second quarter after almost doubling in size during the pandemic, when it needed to beef up its warehouse capabilities. Shopify, whose cloud technology helps retailers build and manage online stores, cut about 1,000 workers, or around 10% of its global workforce. The company doubled its headcount over a two-year period starting at the beginning of 2020, as the business boomed from the number or stores and restaurants that had to suddenly go digital. Shopify CEO Tobias Lutke said in a memo to employees that the company had wagered that the pandemic surge would cause the transition from physical retail to ecommerce to \"permanently leap ahead by 5 or even 10 years.\" \"It's now clear that bet didn't pay off,\" Lutke wrote, adding that the picture was starting to look more like it did before Covid. \"Ultimately, placing this bet was my call to make and I got this wrong. Now, we have to adjust.\" After Facebook parent Meta missed on its results and forecast a second straight quarter of declining revenue, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will be reducing job growth over the next year. Headcount expanded by about 60% during the pandemic. \"This is a period that demands more intensity and I expect us to get more done with fewer resources,\" Zuckerberg said. Google parent Alphabet, which grew its workforce by over 30% during the two Covid years, recently told employees that they needed to focus and improve productivity. The company asked for suggestions on how to be more efficient at work.\n\n\"It's clear we are facing a challenging macro environment with more uncertainty ahead,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said in a meeting with employees. \"We should think about how we can minimize distractions and really raise the bar on both product excellence and productivity.\" Few U.S. companies have been hit as hard as Peloton, whose fitness equipment and on-demand classes became an instant gym replacement during lockdowns and which has since suffered from massive oversupply issues and out-of-control costs. After doubling headcount in the 12 months ended June 30, 2021, the company in February announced plans to cut 20% of corporate positions as it named a new CEO.\n\nBanks and Wall Street bracing for a 'hurricane'\n\nSome of the Peloton products that were flying off the shelves in the pandemic were being offered as perks for overworked junior bankers, who were sorely needed to help manage a boom in IPOs, mergers and stock issuance. Activity picked up with such ferocity that junior bankers were complaining about 100-hour workweeks, and banks started scouting for talent in unusual places like consulting and accounting firms. That helps explain why the six biggest U.S. banks added a combined 59,757 employees from the start of 2020 through the middle of 2022, the equivalent of the industry picking up the full population of a Morgan Stanley or a Goldman Sachs in a little over two years. It wasn't just investment banking. The government unleashed trillions of dollars in stimulus payments and small business loans designed to keep the economy moving amid the widespread shutdowns. A feared wave of loan defaults never arrived, and banks instead took in an unprecedented flood of deposits. Their Main Street lending operations had better repayment rates than before the pandemic. Among top banks, Morgan Stanley saw the biggest jump in headcount, with its employee levels expanding 29% to 78,386 from early 2020 to the middle of this year. The growth was fueled in part by CEO James Gorman\u2019s acquisitions of money management firms E-Trade and Eaton Vance. At rival investment bank Goldman Sachs, staffing levels jumped 22% to 47,000 in the same time frame, as CEO David Solomon broke into consumer finance and bolstered wealth management operations, including through the acquisition of fintech lender GreenSky. Citigroup saw a 15% boost in headcount during the pandemic, while JPMorgan Chase added 8.5% to its workforce, becoming the industry's largest employer. But the good times on Wall Street didn\u2019t last. The stock market had its worst first half in 50 years, and IPOs dried up. Investment banking revenue at the major players declined sharply in the second quarter. Goldman Sachs responded by slowing hiring and is considering a return to year-end job reductions, according to a person with knowledge of the bank\u2019s plans. Employees typically make up the single biggest line item when it comes to expenses in banking, so when markets crater, layoffs are usually on the horizon. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in June that an economic \"hurricane\" was on its way, and said the bank was bracing itself for volatile markets.\n\nJamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., during a Bloomberg Television interview in London, U.K., on Wednesday, May 4, 2022. Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nZipRecruiter's Pollak said one area in finance where there will likely be a hemorrhaging of workers is in mortgage lending. She said 60% more people went into real estate in 2020 and 2021 because of record low mortgage rates and rising home prices. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo have reportedly trimmed hundreds of mortgage staffers as volumes collapsed. \"Nobody is refinancing anymore, and sales are slowing,\" Pollak said. \"You're going to have to see employment levels and hiring slow down. That growth was all about that moment.\" The intersection of Silicon Valley and Wall Street is a particularly gloomy place at the moment as rising rates and crumbling stock multiples converge. Crypto trading platform Coinbase in June announced plans to lay off 18% of its workforce in preparation for a \"crypto winter\" and even rescinded job offers to people it had hired. Headcount tripled in 2021 to 3,730 employees. Stock trading app Robinhood said Tuesday it's cutting about 23% of its workforce, a little over three months after eliminating 9% of its full-time staff, which had ballooned from 2,100 to 3,800 in the last nine months of 2021. \"We are at the tail end of that pandemic-era distortion,\" said Aaron Terrazas, chief economist at job search and review site Glassdoor. \"Obviously, it's not going away, but it is changing to a more normalized period, and companies are adapting to this new reality.\"\n\nRetail is whipsawing back and forth\n\nNurphoto | Getty Images\n\nThey hardly could have predicted how quickly the dynamic would shift, as rapid and soaring inflation forced Americans to tighten their belts. Retailers have already started to warn of waning demand, leaving them with bloated inventories. Gap said higher promotions will hurt gross margins in its fiscal second quarter. Kohl's cut its guidance for the second quarter, citing softened consumer spending. Walmart last week slashed its profit forecast and said surging prices for food and gas are squeezing consumers. That pain is filtering into the ad market. Online bulletin board Pinterest on Monday cited \"lower than expected demand from U.S. big box retailers and mid-market advertisers\" as one reason why it missed Wall Street estimates for second-quarter earnings and revenue. Retail giants have so far avoided big layoff announcements, but smaller players are in cut mode. Stitch Fix, 7-Eleven and Game Stop have said they'll be eliminating jobs, and outdoor grill maker Weber warned it's considering layoffs as sales slow.\n\nThe travel industry can't hire fast enough\n\nWith all of the downsizing taking place across wide swaths of the U.S. economy, the applicant pool should be wide open for airlines, restaurants and hospitality companies, which are trying to repopulate their ranks after undergoing mass layoffs when Covid hit. It's not so easy. Even though Amazon has reduced headcount of late, it's still got far more people working in its warehouses than it did two years ago. Last year the company lifted average starting pay to $18 an hour, a level that's difficult to meet for much of the services industry. Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta said on the quarterly earnings call in May that he wasn't satisfied with customer service and that the company needs more workers. At the end of last year, even as travel was rebounding sharply, headcount at Hilton's managed, owned and leased properties as well as corporate locations was down by over 30,000 from two years earlier. It's easy to see why customer service is a challenge. According to a report last week from McKinsey on summer 2022 travel trends, revenue per available room in the U.S. \"is outstripping not just 2020 and 2021 levels, but increasingly 2019 levels too.\"\n\nDelta Airlines passenger jets are pictured outside the newly completed 1.3 million-square foot $4 billion Delta Airlines Terminal C at LaGuardia Airport in New York, June 1, 2022.

He was 59 years old.\n\nJain, who most recently served as the president of Cantor Fitzgerald, earned an MBA at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and worked at several financial firms, including Merrill Lynch, before moving to Deutsche Bank. He served as co-CEO from 2012 to 2015.\n\nJain stepped down from his role at Deutsche before his contract ended after the bank was beset by a string of regulatory issues.\n\nHis other positions included a role as an advisor at fintech company SoFi from 2016 to 2017 and as a trustee of British charity Chance to Shine.\n\n\"He believed in hard work, meritocracy, operating outside of expectations or conventional boundaries, placing family first, standing by one's roots (having turned away many attempts to Westernize him in an industry that was often homogenous), in speaking 'at the margin' rather than delivering plain facts, in wit and wordplay, in being nonmaterialistic, and in the importance of having broad-bandwidth and being a 'scholar-athlete,'\" his family said in a statement.\n\n\"We are grateful to the many people who cared for Anshu throughout his life. For us, his legacy is tenacity, honour, and love,\" the statement said.\n\nHoward Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, also released a statement about Jain's passing.\n\n\"Anshu was the consummate professional who brought a wealth of experience and wisdom to his role as President. He will be remembered as an extraordinary leader, partner, and dear friend who will be greatly missed by all of us and by all who knew him,\" Lutnick said. \"On behalf of all our partners and employees, we extend our deepest sympathies to Anshu's family and wish them peace and healing during this difficult time.\"\n\nCorrection: This article has been updated to delete a reference to Ajit Jain, who is not related to Anshu Jain.",

                "text": "St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Wednesday that the central bank will continue raising rates until it sees compelling evidence that inflation is falling.\n\nThe central bank official said he expects another 1.5 percentage points or so in interest rate increases this year as the Fed continues to battle the highest inflation levels since the early 1980s.\n\n\"I think we'll probably have to be higher for longer in order to get the evidence that we need to see that inflation is actually turning around on all dimensions and in a convincing way coming lower, not just a tick lower here and there,\" Bullard said during a live \"Squawk Box\" interview on CNBC.\n\nThat message of continued rate hikes is consistent with other Fed speakers this week, including regional presidents Loretta Mester of Cleveland, Charles Evans of Chicago and Mary Daly of San Francisco. Each said Tuesday that the inflation fight is far from over and more monetary policy tightening will be needed.\n\nBoth Bullard and Mester are voting members this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. The group last week approved a second consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase to the Fed's benchmark borrowing rate.\n\nIf Bullard has his way, the rate will continue rising to a range of 3.75%-4% by the end of the year. After starting 2022 near zero, the rate has now come up to a range of 2.25%-2.5%.\n\nConsumer price inflation is running at a 12-month rate of 9.1%, its highest since November 1981. Even throwing out the highs and lows of inflation, as the Dallas Fed does with its \"trimmed mean\" estimate, inflation is running at 4.3%.\n\n\"We're going to have to see convincing evidence across the board, headline and other measures of core inflation, all coming down convincingly before we'll be able to feel like we're doing our job,\" Bullard said.\n\nThe rate hikes come at a time of slowing growth in the U.S., which has seen consecutive quarters of negative GDP readings, a common definition of recession. However, Bullard said he doesn't think the economy is really in recession.\n\n\"We're not in a recession right now. We do have these two quarters of negative GDP growth. To some extent, a recession is in the eyes of the beholder,\" he said. \"With all the job growth in the first half of the year, it's hard to say there's a recession. With a flat unemployment rate at 3.6%, it's hard to say there's a recession.\"\n\nThe second half of the year should see reasonably strong growth, though job gains probably will slow to their longer-run trend, he added. July's nonfarm payroll growth is expected to be 258,000, according to Dow Jones estimates.\n\nEven with the slowing trend, markets are pricing in another half percentage point rate hike from the Fed in September, though the chances of a third consecutive 0.75 percentage point move are rising. The market then expects future increases in November and December, taking the benchmark fed funds rate to a range of 3.25%-3.5% by the end of the year, below Bullard's target.\n\n\"We're going to follow the data very carefully, and I think we'll get it right,\" Bullard said.",

                "text": "Luis Alvarez | Digitalvision | Getty Images\n\nEmployers are using signing bonuses at an elevated rate to attract talent \u2014 and there are ways workers can capitalize on the trend. A signing bonus is a financial sweetener \u2014 often a lump sum of cash \u2014 that businesses offer prospective hires. Offers vary widely by company and position, and they can be quite generous. For example, Walgreens is offering a $75,000 signing bonus to pharmacists in some areas to reduce staffing shortages, according to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal.

That suggests employers are competing to fill open jobs at a time when workers are still \"in the driver's seat,\" according to AnnElizabeth Konkel, an economist at Indeed. \"If employers could find workers a dime a dozen, I don't think they'd be using signing bonuses in this way,\" Konkel said.\n\n8 job sectors advertising the most signing bonuses\n\nThe trend is more prevalent among in-person health-care jobs, like nursing, dental, medical technicians, physicians and surgeons, and home health care, according to Indeed data. More than 10% of jobs ads in these respective categories offered a signing-bonus benefit in July. For example, the share of job listings advertising these bonuses jumped from 6% to 18% in the three years from July 2019 to July 2021, according to Indeed. Here are the top eight occupational sectors that advertised a signing bonus in July 2022, according to Indeed. Nursing: 18.1% of all job listings Driving: 15.1% Dental: 14.7% Veterinary: 13.5% Medical technician: 12.6% Physicians and surgeons: 11.4% Childcare: 11.3% Personal care and home health: 11.3%\n\n'Demand for workers is still going strong'\n\nWorkers have enjoyed the benefits of strong labor market since early 2021, when businesses were ramping up hiring as they re-opened more broadly after a pandemic-era lull. Job openings soared to record highs and wages grew at the fastest pace in decades, incentivizing employees to quit in record numbers and find better-quality or higher-paying work elsewhere.\n\nWorkers have the ability to negotiate whatever they choose to negotiate. AnnElizabeth Konkel economist at Indeed\n\nDespite cooling in recent months, the trend known as the Great Resignation or the Great Reshuffle remains in full swing, according to labor economists. Though surveys suggest some workers later regretted their decision if their new gig didn't live up to expectations, for example. The July jobs report issued last week beat expectations and the U.S. unemployment rate has fallen back to its pre-pandemic level, which had been the lowest since 1969. \"Demand for workers is still going strong, so workers have the ability to negotiate whatever they choose to negotiate,\" Konkel said. \"Maybe that's a signing bonus, maybe that's asking for a higher hourly wage, maybe that's flexibility, maybe that's a particular benefit.\"\n\nNegotiating a signing bonus: 'Make them love you'\n\nLjubaphoto | E+ | Getty Images\n\nThere are a few ways workers can think about negotiating a signing bonus \u2014 or a better offer if one is already on the table. First, think about the money you may be leaving on the table at your current employer, according to Mandi Woodruff-Santos, a career and money coach. She has estimated that negotiating signing bonuses added $160,000 to her income over a 10-year period. That category might include unvested 401(k) match funds or stock options \u2014 money that isn't yet yours but would be if you stayed at your current job. It may also include tuition reimbursement or a signing bonus your current employer paid, but which you'd have to pay back if you don't meet certain contractual obligations such as employment duration. Add this all up, and you can use this sum to negotiate for a signing bonus of that amount with a prospective employer, said Woodruff-Santos, who founded MandiMoney Makers, a group coaching community for women of color.",

                "text": "Mary Daly, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, poses after giving a speech on the U.S. economic outlook, in Idaho Falls, Idaho, U.S., November 12 2018.\n\nThe Federal Reserve still has a lot of work to do before it gets inflation under control, and that means higher interest rates, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Tuesday.\n\n\"People are still struggling with the higher prices they're paying and the rising prices,\" Daly said during a live LinkedIn interview with CNBC's Jon Fortt. \"The number of people who can't afford this week what they paid for with ease six months ago just means our work is far from done.\"\n\nSeparately, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans opened up the possibility of another large rate hike ahead, but said he hopes that can be avoided, with the Fed being able to bring down inflation without having to use harsh policy tightening.\n\nSo far this year, the central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate four times, totaling 2.25 percentage points. That has come in response to inflation running at a 9.1% annual rate, the highest level since November 1981.\n\nThe Fed in July raised its funds rate 0.75 percentage point, the same as it hiked in June. Those were the largest back-to-back increases since the central bank started using the funds rate as its chief monetary policy tool in the early 1990s.\n\nBut Daly cautioned that no one should take those big moves as an indication that the Fed is winding down its rate hikes.\n\n\"Nowhere near almost done,\" she said in assessing the progress. \"We have made a good start and I feel really pleased with where we've gotten to at this point.\"\n\nFutures pricing indicates the markets see the Fed raising rates by 0.5 percentage point in September and another half percentage point through the end of the year, taking the funds rate to a range of 3.25%-3.5%, according to CME Group data. That scenario holds that the economy would slow due to the policy tightening, and the Fed would start cutting rates by next summer.\n\nBut Daly pushed back on that notion.\n\n\"That's a puzzle to me,\" she said. \"I don't know where they find that in the data. To me, that would not be my modal outlook.\"\n\nEvans, her Fed colleague, also spoke Tuesday morning, saying the central bank is likely to keep its foot on the brake until it sees inflation coming down. He expects policymakers to raise rates by half a percentage point at their next meeting in September, but left the door open to a bigger move.\n\n\"Fifty [basis points] is a reasonable assessment, but 75 could also be OK,\" he told reporters. \"I doubt that more would be called for.\" A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.\n\n\"We wanted to get to neutral expeditiously. We want to get a little restrictive expeditiously,\" Evans added. \"We want to see if the real side effects are going to start coming back in line ... or if we have a lot more ahead of us.\"\n\nHowever, he also said he's hopeful that policymakers could soon pause the rate hikes as inflation comes down.\n\nNeither Evans nor Daly are voting members this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, though they do participate in policy sessions.\n\nThe FOMC does not meet in August, when it will hold its annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Its next two-day meeting is next month, Sept. 20-21.",

But he noted that, \"I'd like to see a period of sustained inflation under control, and until we do that I think we're just going to have to continue to move rates into restrictive territory.\"\n\nHeadline consumer prices were flat in July while producer prices declined 0.5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nHowever, that was just one-month's data: CPI still was up 8.5% on a year-over-year basis, and the producer price index climbed 9.8%. Both numbers are still far above the Fed's 2% long-run inflation objective, so Barkin said the central bank needs to keep pushing forward until it achieves its goal.\n\n\"You'd like to see inflation running at our target, which is 2% at the PCE, and I'd like to see it running at our target for a period of time,\" he said. The Fed uses as its preferred gauge the personal consumption expenditures price index; June headline PCE ran at a 6.8% annual rate while core excluding food and energy was at 4.8%.\n\nBarkin's comments reflect those of most Fed officials who have spoken recently about rates.\n\nThe central bank has hiked its benchmark borrowing rate 0.75 percentage point at each of its last two meetings. Markets are divided over whether the Fed will increase by three-quarters of a point in September or scale down to half a point, with traders tilting slightly toward the latter, according to CME Group data Friday morning.\n\nWhichever is the case, Barkin said acting aggressively now is important. He said his constituents are deeply concerned about inflation and want action from the Fed.\n\n\"Consumers really dislike inflation, and one message that I get loud and clear as I wander around my district is, 'we don't like inflation,'\" he said.",

                "text": "A \"For Sale\" sign outside a house in Albany, California, US, on Tuesday, May 31, 2022. Homebuyers are facing a worsening affordability situation with mortgage rates hovering around the highest levels in more than a decade.\n\nMortgage balances rose 1.9% for the quarter, or $207 billion, to about $11.4 trillion, even though the pace of originations moved lower. That annual increase marked a 9.1% gain from a year ago as home prices exploded during the pandemic era.\n\n\"Americans are borrowing more, but a big part of the increased borrowing is attributable to higher prices,\" the New York Fed said in a blog post accompanying the release.\n\nThe collective American IOU totaled $16.15 trillion through the end of June, good for a $312 billion \u2014 or 2% \u2014 increase from the previous quarter. Debt gains were widespread but particularly focused on mortgages and vehicle purchases.\n\nHousehold debt climbed past $16 trillion in the second quarter for the first time, as soaring inflation pushed up housing and auto balances, the New York Federal Reserve reported Tuesday.\n\nCredit card balances surged $46 billion in the three-month period and 13% over the past year, which Fed researchers said was the largest gain in more than 20 years. Non-housing credit balances increased 2.4% from the first quarter, the biggest gain since 2016.\n\nStudent loan debt was little changed at $1.59 trillion.\n\nThe increase in borrowing comes with inflation running at an 8.6% annual rate in the second quarter that included a 9.1% increase in June \u2014 the biggest move since November 1981 \u2014 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Shelter inflation rose at a 5.5% annual rate in June and new and used vehicle prices were up 11.4% and 7.1% respectively.\n\nIn response to the elevated inflation levels, the Fed has raised interest rates four times in 2022, with the increases totaling 2.25 percentage points. Those moves in turn have pushed up 30-year mortgage rates to 5.41%, up more than 2 percentage points from the beginning of the year, according to Freddie Mac.\n\nDespite the rising debt and inflation levels and higher interest rates, delinquency rates remained relatively benign.\n\n\"Although debt balances are growing rapidly, households in general have weathered the pandemic remarkably well, due in no small part to the expansive programs put in place to support them,\" the Fed blog post said. \"Further, household debt is held overwhelmingly by higher-score borrowers, even more so now than it has been in the history of our data.\"\n\nThrough June, some 2.7% of outstanding debt was in delinquency, nearly 2 percentage points lower than the first quarter of 2020 as the nation was entering the Covid pandemic.\n\nFed economists noted that delinquency rates were nudging higher for subprime borrowers at the lower end of the credit scale.",

The natural consumer products maker now sees a wider full-year loss than previously thought, due to cost pressures, but expects improvement as the year goes on, including positive adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) \u2013 Rivian shares fell 1% in premarket trading after the electric vehicle maker widened its loss estimate for 2022. It also affirmed prior production guidance.\n\nIllumina (ILMN) \u2013 Illumina tumbled 14.7% in the premarket after the gene-sequencing technology company reported quarterly profit and revenue that was lower than expected, and issued an outlook that was well short of analyst estimates. Illumina said a challenging economic environment is offsetting growth in the use of its gene-sequencing platform.\n\nToast (TOST) \u2013 Toast surged 12.9% in premarket action after the restaurant payment technology company raised its full-year earnings outlook. Toast reported a quarterly loss, but it was narrower than analysts had predicted, with Toast noting a record number of new locations using its technology.\n\nPoshmark (POSH) \u2013 Poshmark fell 1.4% in the premarket after the online fashion retailer issued weaker revenue guidance than expected for the current quarter. Poshmark reported a loss for its latest quarter on increased marketing and research and development expenses, but sales were better than analysts had anticipated.\n\nWheels Up (UP) \u2013 The private jet company's stock added 2% in premarket action after it reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue, although its loss was slightly wider than anticipated. Wheels Up also saw a 16% jump in active users.\n\nOlo (OLO) \u2013 Olo plunged 33% in premarket trading after the restaurant software maker issued a weaker-than-expected current quarter and full-year revenue outlook.\n\nLegalZoom (LZ) \u2013 LegalZoom added 2.1% in the premarket after the purveyor of online legal forms reported better than expected quarterly earnings.",

                "text": "A sign is posted in front of a home for sale on July 14, 2022 in San Francisco, California. The number of homes for sale in the U.S. increased by 2 percent in June for the first time since 2019.\n\nPrice gains are still strong because of an imbalance between supply and demand. The housing market has had a severe shortage for years. Strong demand during the coronavirus pandemic exacerbated it.\n\nHome prices are still higher than they were a year ago, but the gains slowed at the fastest pace on record in June, according to Black Knight, a mortgage software, data and analytics firm that began tracking this metric in the early 1970s. The annual rate of price appreciation fell two percentage points from 19.3% to 17.3%.\n\nRising mortgage rates and inflation in the wider economy caused housing demand to drop sharply in June, forcing home prices to cool down.\n\nEven when home prices crashed dramatically during the recession of 2007-09, the strongest single-month slowdown was 1.19 percentage points. Prices are not expected to fall nationally, given a stronger overall housing market, but higher mortgage rates are certainly taking their toll.\n\nThe average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage crossed above 6% in June, according to Mortgage News Daily. It has since dropped back into the lower 5% range, but that is still significantly higher than the 3% range rates were in at the start of this year.\n\n\"The slowdown was broad-based among the top 50 markets at the metro level, with some areas experiencing even more pronounced cooling,\" said Ben Graboske, president of Black Knight Data & Analytics. \"In fact, 25% of major U.S. markets saw growth slow by three percentage points in June, with four decelerating by four or more points in that month alone.\"\n\nStill, while this was the sharpest cooling on record nationally, the market would have to see six more months of this kind of deceleration for price growth to return to long-run averages, according to Graboske. He calculates that it takes about five months for interest rate impacts to be fully reflected in home prices.\n\nMarkets seeing the sharpest drops are those that previously had the highest prices in the nation. Average home values in San Jose, California, have fallen 5.1% in the last two months, the biggest drop of any of the top markets. That chopped $75,000 off the price.\n\nIn Seattle, prices are down 3.8% in the past two months, or a $30,000 reduction. San Francisco, San Diego and Denver round out the top five markets with the biggest price reductions.\n\nThe cooling in prices coincides with a sharp jump in the supply of homes for sale, up 22% over the last two months, according to Black Knight. Inventory is still, however, 54% lower than 2017-19 levels.\n\n\"With a national shortage of more than 700,000 listings, it would take more than a year of such record increases for inventory levels to fully normalize,\" said Graboske.\n\nPrice drops will not affect the average homeowner as much as they did during the Great Recession, because homeowners today have considerably more equity. Tight underwriting and several years of strong price appreciation caused home equity levels to hit record highs.\n\nDespite that, the strong demand in the market recently could present a problem for some. About 10% of mortgaged properties were purchased in the last year, so price drops could cause some borrowers to edge much lower in their equity positions.",

                "text": "The Federal Reserve is unlikely to pivot from its hawkish interest rate hikes despite positive signs this week that inflation in the U.S. could be easing, according to market strategists. On Thursday, the producer price index surprisingly fell 0.5% in July from the prior month, compared with an estimate of a 0.2% gain, according to a Dow Jones survey. On an annual basis, the index rose 9.8%, the lowest rate since October 2021. That followed encouraging data that showed consumer prices rose 8.5% in July. The rate was slightly cooler than the 8.7% expected by analysts surveyed by Dow Jones and a slowing pace from the prior month. As both CPI and PPI soften, markets have started to moderate their expectations for Fed rate hikes. Still, the positive data doesn't mean it is \"mission complete\" for the Fed, said Ben Emons, managing director of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors. \"If you strip off any of the headline noise, some of the\u2026 CPI, even PPI [numbers] show still upward pressures,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Friday. \"The Fed cannot be done here. It probably means that the 75-basis-point rate hike remains on the table.\" \"The pricing on the Fed fund futures and euro-dollar futures shows that we're still more towards the 75-basis-point rate hike. And I think it is because of the guidance that all these Fed speakers keep giving us \u2014 'just don't be complacent here, we're going to continue,'\" Emons added.\n\nLast week, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the central bank will continue raising rates until it sees compelling evidence that inflation is falling. That message is consistent with other Fed speakers, including regional presidents Loretta Mester of Cleveland, Charles Evans of Chicago and Mary Daly of San Francisco. All of them have indicated recently that the inflation fight is far from over and more monetary policy tightening will be needed.\n\n'Not enough evidence'\n\nThe Fed raised its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point in both June and July \u2014 the largest back-to-back increases since the central bank started using the funds rate as its chief monetary policy tool in the early 1990s. Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments, said the Fed is nowhere near putting the brakes and turning dovish on rate hikes, given the current data. \"For me, there's not enough evidence for the Fed to make a huge pivot from where they are. I still think they're considering 50, 75 basis points at the September meeting,\" she told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia\" on Friday. \"Not anything coming out of the economic reports from CPI or the PPI in today's session is going to change that at this point in time. I think we still have a considerable ways to go,\" she added. Investors will be looking for guidance from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on what the Fed could do at its next meeting in September.\n\nInflation still sticky\n\nFernandez underlined the stickier parts of inflation, such as wage and rent pressures, are still high. Those are not coming down at the same rate as energy, oil and gasoline components, she said.",

I'm focused on the wage data. And so far, inflation continues to surprise us to the upside. Wages continue to grow.\"\n\nLast month, U.S. inflation jumped to a four-decade record high, rising 9.1% from a year ago. At the same time, the labor market remained strong: Nonfarm payrolls increased by 372,000 last month, alongside a low national unemployment rate of 3.6%.\n\nOn Thursday, new Labor Department data showed signs of a job market cooldown, with initial jobless claims hitting their highest level since mid-November. Still, Kashkari said, the labor market is \"very, very strong.\"\n\n\"Typically, recessions demonstrate high job losses, high unemployment, those are terrible for American families. And we're not seeing anything like that,\" he said.\n\nThe problem, Kashkari said, is that even in a strong job market, inflation is outpacing wage growth \u2014 giving many Americans a functional \"wage cut\" as living costs increase nationwide. Solving that problem by reducing inflation is the Federal Reserve's top goal right now, he added.\n\n\"Whether we are technically in a recession or not doesn't change the fact that the Federal Reserve has its own work to do, and we are committed to doing it,\" Kashkari said.\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Thursday that the country's gross domestic product shrunk for the second straight quarter, often a warning sign accompanying economic recessions. For Kashkari, that may actually be a good thing: An economic slowdown could help reduce inflation to the point where it no longer outpaces wage growth.\n\n\"We definitely want to see some slowing [of economic growth],\" he said. \"We don't want to see the economy overheating. We would love it if we could transition to a sustainable economy without tipping the economy into recession.\"\n\nDoing so poses a significant challenge for the Fed. Kashkari acknowledged that economic slowdowns tend to be very difficult to control, \"especially if it's the central bank that's inducing the slowdown.\"\n\nStill, he said, the bank will do whatever is necessary to tame inflation.\n\n\"We're going to do everything we can to avoid a recession, but we are committed to bringing inflation down, and we are going to do what we need to do,\" Kashkari said. \"We are a long way away from achieving an economy that is back at 2% inflation. And that's where we need to get to.\"",

Lucas Schifres | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 China's tourist-heavy province of Hainan is falling further behind lofty growth goals it set in January. Back then, the island said it aimed for 9% GDP growth this year. But like China's economy overall, growth is running far below initial targets \u2014 due in a large part to outbreaks of a far more transmissible Covid variant. A surge in Covid infections this month forced Hainan's oceanside resort city of Sanya to order tens of thousands of tourists to stay put at their hotels, and local residents to stay at home. Haikou, the province's capital, also issued stay-home orders. Airlines cancelled flights, leaving tourists stranded on Hainan island since Saturday. In the last few days, some people have been able to return to the mainland on government-organized charter flights. But questions remain \u2014 about uniform implementation of hotel stay subsidies, the cost of food and how soon most tourists can return to their homes.\n\n\"The public image and reputation of Hainan is damaged for the short term,\" said Jacques Penhirin, a partner in the Greater China office of Oliver Wyman. \"When I talk to the client they're all looking at the bookings for [the upcoming fall holiday] which are still quite resilient. People have not cancelled yet, but it's not looking good. Probably down on last year.\" It's \"going to be bad for luxury brands and hospitality at least until Chinese New Year next year,\" he said, referring to the Lunar New Year holiday in late January 2023.\n\nHainan's economy\n\nIn late July, China's top leaders indicated the country might miss the GDP target of around 5.5% set in March. Beijing did not signal any large-scale stimulus, or any change to its \"dynamic zero-Covid\" policy. The national economy grew by just 2.5% in the first half of the year, according to official figures. Hainan's economy underperformed even that sluggish pace, only growing by 1.6% in the first half of 2022. That's a sharp slowdown from the island's 11.2% GDP growth for all of 2021. In fact, Hainan's growth last year was second only to that of Hubei province, pointed out Ying Zhang, research analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nRead more about China from CNBC Pro JPMorgan says buy this undervalued Chinese biopharma stock that can rally more than 40% from here\n\n\"Because of the international travel restriction, Hainan has benefited from the tourism revenue, up by nearly 60% last year,\" she said. Zhang estimates tourism accounts for more than 80% of Hainan's economy. Sanya, on the southern coast of Hainan, was the top destination for couples flying from three of China's largest cities last week for China's version of Valentine's Day, according to booking site Trip.com. The island boasts one of the few beachfront locations for international luxury hotels like Mandarin Oriental and Hyatt in mainland China. Hainan is also building out duty-free shopping malls as part of central government's push to turn the island into a free trade hub and international shopping area. Sales at duty-free stores on the island surged by 84% last year to 60.17 billion yuan ($8.93 billion), according to official figures. During a consumer goods expo in Hainan in late July, sales at four duty-free stores rose by 27% year-on-year to 330 million yuan, the customs agency said.\n\nAnother hit to confidence\n\nSo far, cosmetics brands rely far more on Hainan for sales than affordable luxury brands \u2014 potentially up to a third of their China business, said Oliver Wyman's Penhirin. He said Hainan generally accounts for less than 5% of China sales for affordable luxury brands, while high-end luxury has yet to enter that market. An Oliver Wyman survey in May found that after roughly two months of lockdown in the metropolis of Shanghai, respondents from luxury and premium consumer brands cut their China growth expectations for the year by 15 percentage points.\n\nTens of thousands of tourists were stranded in the resort city of Sanya, Hainan, this week as local Covid outbreaks prompted airlines to cancel flights.

                "text": "An inflation gauge that the Federal Reserve uses as its primary barometer jumped to its highest 12-month gain in more than 40 years in June, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Friday.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures price index rose 6.8%, the biggest 12-month move since the 6.9% increase in January 1982. The index rose 1% from May, tying its biggest monthly gain since February 1981.\n\nExcluding food and energy, so-called core PCE increased 4.8% from a year ago, up one-tenth of a percentage point from May but off the recent high of 5.3% hit in February. On a monthly basis, core was up 0.6%, its biggest monthly gain since April 2021.\n\nBoth core readings were 0.1 percentage point above the Dow Jones estimates.\n\nFed officials generally focus on core inflation, but have turned their attention recently to the headline numbers as well, as food and fuel prices have soared in 2022.\n\nThe BEA release also showed that personal consumption expenditures, a gauge of consumer spending, increased 1.1% for the month, above the 0.9% estimate and owing largely to the surge in prices. Real spending adjusted for inflation increased just 0.1% as consumers barely kept up with inflation. Personal income rose 0.6%, topping the 0.5% estimate, but disposable income adjusted for inflation fell 0.3%.\n\nEarlier this month, data showed the consumer price index rose 9.1% from a year ago, the biggest gain since November 1981. The Fed prefers PCE over CPI as a broader measure of inflation pressures. CPI indicates the change in the out-of-pocket expenditures of urban households, while the PCE index measures the price change in goods and services consumed by all households, as well as nonprofit institutions serving households.\n\nThere was other bad inflation news Thursday.\n\nThe employment cost index, another figure Fed policymakers follow closely, rose 1.3% in the second quarter. That represented a slight decline from the 1.4% gain in the previous quarter, but was ahead of the 1.1% estimate. Further, the 5.1% increase on a 12-month basis marked a record for a data series that goes back to the first quarter of 2002.\n\n\"The rest of the economy might be slowing down, but wages are speeding up,\" said Nick Bunker, economic research director at job placement site Indeed. \"Competition for workers remains fierce as employers have to keep bidding up wages for new hires. These red-hot wage growth statistics may fade in the near term, but there's a long way for them to drop.\"\n\nThe Fed has been using a recipe of rate increases and a reduction in asset holdings to bring down prices that have soared to their highest levels since the Reagan administration and have helped cool consumer spending.\n\nPrivate sector wage gains of 1.6% for the quarter are \"seriously disappointing\" for the Fed, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nThe Fed follows the ECI figures because they adjust for compositional effects, or imbalances between gains from higher- and lower-wage workers, as well as other factors.\n\n\"Wage gains at this pace are far too high for the Fed, because they would require implausible rapid productivity growth in order to be consistent with the inflation target in the medium-term,\" Shepherdson wrote.\n\nFed officials earlier this week approved a second consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase in the central bank's benchmark interest rate. Inflation by any measure has been running well above the Fed's 2% longer-run target, and Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is \"strongly committed\" to bringing inflation down.\n\nIn normal times, the Fed focuses on inflation excluding food and energy costs because they are so volatile and don't always reflect longer-run trends. But Powell acknowledged Wednesday that policymakers need to be attentive to both types of inflation in the current environment.\n\n\"Core inflation is a better predictor of inflation going forward, headline inflation tends to be volatile. So, in ordinary times, you look through volatile moves in commodities,\" he said. \"The problem with the current situation is that if you have a sustained period of supply shocks, those can actually start to undermine or to work on de-anchoring inflation expectations. The public doesn't distinguish between core and headline inflation in their thinking.\"\n\nMarkets expect the Fed to raise rates by another half percentage point in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tracker. However, the probability for a bigger three-quarter-point hike rose Friday morning to 38%.",

Pictured here is a residential complex under construction on Dec. 15, 2021, in Guizhou province.\n\nBEIJING \u2014 China's real estate troubles could spill into other major sectors if the problems persist \u2014 and three particular businesses are most vulnerable, according to ratings agency Fitch.\n\nSince last year, investors have worried that Chinese property developers' financial problems could spread to the rest of the economy. In the last two months, many homebuyers' refusal to pay their mortgages have brought developers' problems to the forefront again \u2014 while China's economic growth slows.\n\n\"If timely and effective policy intervention does not materialise, distress in the property market will be prolonged and have effects on various sectors in China beyond the property sector's immediate value chain,\" Fitch analysts said in a report Monday.\n\nUnder such a stress scenario, Fitch analyzed the impact over the next 12 to 24 months on more than 30 kinds of businesses and government entities. The firm found three that are most vulnerable to real estate's troubles:\n\n1. Asset management companies\n\nThese firms \"hold a sizeable amount of assets that are backed by real estate-related collateral, making them highly exposed to prolonged property-market distress,\" the report said.\n\n2. Engineering, construction firms (non state-owned)\n\n\u201cThe sector in general has been in difficulty since 2021. ... They do not have competitive advantages in infrastructure project exposure or funding access relative to their [government-related] peers,\" the report said.\n\n3. Smaller steel producers\n\n\"Many have been operating at a loss for a few months and could face liquidity issues if China's economy remains lacklustre, especially given the high leverage in the sector,\" the report said.\n\nFitch said construction accounts for 55% of steel demand in China.\n\nThe slowdown in real estate has already dragged down broader economic indicators like fixed asset investment and the furniture sales component of retail sales.",
