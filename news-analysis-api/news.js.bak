                "text": "Reading and watching the media over the past year, you might be forgiven for thinking that we are facing the collapse of civilisation. We have a shrinking economy, a fuel crisis that may bring on energy rationing and forced blackouts, extreme weather events, the increased chance of nuclear war, and risk of the growth of a new pandemic riding on the back of the last. The Doomsday Clock \u2013 a symbol created by scientists to represent the likelihood of a human-made catastrophe \u2013 places us at just 100 seconds before midnight, the closest we\u2019ve been to Armageddon in the project\u2019s 75-year history.\n\nIn the face of these threats, it may be hard to maintain a rose-tinted view of the future \u2013 unless, that is, you are the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker. In 2018, his book Enlightenment Now argued that our interpretations of news events make us far too gloomy. There has never been a better time to be alive, he said, thanks to the social, economic, political, technological, and medical advances of the past 300 years.\n\nAt the time of its publication, Pinker\u2019s book attracted as much scorn as praise. One common criticism was that he had oversimplified complex subjects and neglected any phenomena that might suggest a lack of progress. Pinker has, however, attempted to address many of the criticisms, and the recent challenges facing the world do not appear to have changed his opinion.\n\nOn Radio 4\u2019s Today programme last week, he revisited the arguments of Enlightenment Now to explain why he believes there are still reasons to remain optimistic in 2022. \u201cWe have to remember that there\u2019s no law of nature that spaces bad things apart,\u201d he said. \u201cBad things happen, and they will appear to come in clusters \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re being punished for our collective sins or that we\u2019re in a uniquely dangerous moment.\u201d He maintains humanity has the tools to deal with the challenges we face.\n\nThere is certainly something comforting about seeing cause for hope in crises. But do we really have good grounds for optimism? To find out, the Observer examines four indices of progress and the ways they have been affected by recent events.\n\nHealth in the time of Covid\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic is the obvious place to start. According to the World Health Organization, more than 6.4 million have so far died of the infection, since the virus emerged. In a sample of 37 countries, the British Medical Journal found all but six had experienced a reduction in life expectancy as a result. That\u2019s not to mention the burden of long Covid, which is thought to affect around two million people in the UK alone.\n\nPinker\u2019s 2018 book Enlightenment Now attracted scorn from some quarters when it was published, but the author continues to defend its message. Photograph: Geoffroy van der Hasselt/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThis is certainly a step backwards for global health. But it is worth noting that Pinker has never claimed that we will see continuous progress without any setbacks. His argument is more concerned with the ways we cope with problems and find potential solutions. Did we deal with the threat better than we would have been able to in years gone by?\n\nThe jury is still out on the UK government\u2019s initial response to the crisis. But the rapid development of Covid vaccines is undoubtedly a triumph of scientific progress. According to a recent study from Imperial College\u2019s Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, the vaccination programme saved at least 14 million people \u2013 and potentially as many as 19.8 million \u2013 in its first year.\n\nThis simply wouldn\u2019t have been possible in years gone by; all previous vaccines had taken at least five years to develop, and at the start of the pandemic many scientists believed the possibility of creating a new one from scratch was naively optimistic. That may be some cause of optimism for our ability to deal with future health threats.\n\nWealth and happiness\n\nOne of Enlightenment Now\u2019s core arguments is that people today are far wealthier than people in previous decades \u2013 and that this has resulted in higher life satisfaction, through greater comfort, more free time and better education. Pinker dismisses the idea that inequality is a driver of unrest \u2013 it is each person\u2019s absolute wealth that matters, he says, which means we do not need to worry too much if much of a country\u2019s gains in GDP go disproportionately to the richest echelons of society.\n\nThe evidence for this is not quite as clearcut as Pinker would claim, however. Recent research by veteran economist Richard Easterlin found that China\u2019s and India\u2019s recent economic growth have done very little for the population\u2019s overall happiness. More comprehensively, a study by Ma\u0142gorzata Mikucka at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium analysed life satisfaction in 46 countries from 1981 to 2012. It found that an increase in GDP only brought about greater happiness if it was accompanied by reduced inequality and increased social capital.\n\nNone of this bodes well for our lives over the next few months and years. The Office for National Statistics has just reported that the UK\u2019s GDP has shrunk in the second quarter of 2022, suggesting that we are on the brink of a recession, while the average salary is set to fall behind inflation by 8% this year \u2013 the biggest drop in real wages in over 100 years. And according to the International Monetary Fund, the cost of living crisis is likely to widen inequality by hitting the poorest homes hardest.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that, by the start of this year, real wages had not fully recovered from the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 suggesting that this is more than a momentary blip in our living standards.\n\nWar and peace\n\nOne of Pinker\u2019s most controversial claims concerns our propensity to kill each other. He first made the case that human violence is at an all-time low in The Better Angels of Our Nature, published in 2011, and then revisited the idea seven years later in Enlightenment Now.\n\nMuch of Pinker\u2019s argument concerns warfare. Using data concerning the sheer number of conflicts, their length, the proportion of lives lost, and the level of military investment, Pinker notes a downward trend across the centuries. Clearly, there are exceptions \u2013 the huge numbers of lives lost in both world wars, for one; you can only reach his conclusion by looking at average numbers across the globe over large time periods.\n\nPinker argues that various forces \u2013 such as the increasing importance of international trade, the rise of democracy, and the actions of institutions such as the UN \u2013 have made war much less desirable for most leaders, pushing us into the period known by some historians as the \u201clong peace\u201d.\n\nThe war in Ukraine challenges Pinker\u2019s view that human society has, historically speaking, entered a \u2018long peace\u2019. Photograph: Anatolii Stepanov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut many other scholars have questioned these conclusions. One analysis by Aaron Clauset at the University of Colorado in Boulder, for example, concluded that the \u201clong peace\u201d may just be a statistical fluke. It is possible for any probabilistic events to cluster in certain periods and to disappear in others. For an analogy, consider how many times you can throw a coin and it lands on tails, despite the probability being 50:50. You might conclude that the coin is biased \u2013 but with more throws the overall frequencies will tend to balance out. According to Clauset\u2019s paper, the \u201clong peace\u201d may be similarly ephemeral.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and growing tensions over Taiwan, have of course placed the thought of global war at the front of everyone\u2019s minds. We can hope that diplomacy will prevent disaster, but optimistic historical analyses provide cold comfort when our fate can depend on the erratic decisions of dictators such as Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe environment\n\nWith the record-breaking heatwaves this year, and the threat of wildfires sweeping across the UK, it feels like we are already witnessing the start of the climate emergency \u2013 and unless we take drastic action, it is only set to worsen.\n\nPinker certainly doesn\u2019t deny climate change, which he acknowledges is a \u201cgargantuan problem\u201d, but he has criticised \u201ceco-pessimism\u201d and the prevalence of what he considers to be alarmist green messaging. In Enlightenment Now, he describes many environmental successes, such as the reduction of water pollution, the elimination of acid rain and a recent deceleration in deforestation. He points to data showing that many countries\u2019 CO 2 emissions are now plateauing. For an escape route from disaster, he points to ideas such as carbon taxing, combined with a reliance on nuclear power and technologies such as carbon capture, which involves scrubbing CO 2 from power stations before it is released and locking it underground.\n\nClimate Change is a gargantuan problem, but the idea it threatens imminent human extinction or destruction of civilization is pernicious. It's not what the science says; it's emotionally destructive; & it discourages action (why bother if we're doomed?) https://t.co/oTybFKUKom \u2014 Steven Pinker (@sapinker) August 23, 2021\n\nNeedless to say, the \u201ceco-pessimists\u201d are unimpressed. Technologies such as carbon capture do offer some promise, but their efficacy is unproven. And we will also require strong political will, which has been far from obvious in the years since Pinker\u2019s book was published. A UN report from 2021 found most governments were \u201cnowhere close to the level of ambition needed to limit climate change to 1.5C and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement\u201d, though it is possible that a drive to reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas could galvanise efforts to switch to renewables.\n\nPinker\u2019s optimism relies on the fact that we \u2013 and our governments \u2013 will act rationally, according to the Enlightenment principles of reason, science and humanism. Our combined brainpower may certainly have the capacity to solve the climate crisis, but to believe that our politicians will take action in time \u2013 that may require a leap of faith.\n\nDavid Robson is the author of The Expectation Effect: How Your Mindset Can Transform Your Life",

                "text": "In Britain, the year 1976 was marked by three big events \u2013 a summer heatwave, a change of prime minister and a sterling crisis. In 2022, we have had the first and will soon get the second. Few would be entirely surprised if the third arrived by the end of the year.\n\nAs has been the case this year, in the summer of 1976 people enjoyed the sunshine and seemed not to care much about high inflation. According to a 2004 report from the New Economics Foundation thinktank, the UK has never been happier than it was in the year when Denis Howell was made the drought minister, Concorde made its first commercial flight and the Sex Pistols released Anarchy in the UK.\n\nHowever, as the year wore on, the economic problems intensified. James Callaghan, who had taken over as prime minister from Harold Wilson in April, was forced to go to the International Monetary Fund for financial support. An IMF team spent the autumn coming up with a package that involved painful spending cuts. The diaries of Tony Benn, the then energy minister, reveal how split the cabinet was between those who reluctantly supported austerity and those \u2013 such as Benn \u2013 who thought Britain should try to grow its way out of trouble.\n\nThe UK is now less than a month away from getting a new prime minister and for either Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss the challenge looks as daunting as it did for Callaghan. The economy contracted by 0.1% in the second quarter of 2022, which was actually slightly better than expected, but the growth figures do not really capture the fundamental weakness of the economy. A better guide to that are the trade figures, which are truly appalling. As Samuel Tombs, a UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, pointed out, the trade deficit expressed as a percentage of GDP has been bigger in the first six months of 2022 than in any comparable period since quarterly records began in 1955. The position is only going to get worse in the second half of 2022 as the bill for imported gas rises sharply. Sterling looks vulnerable, Tombs says, and he is right.\n\nThe Tory leadership candidate Rishi Sunak campaigns at an event in Bexhill. Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters\n\nThere are plenty of things that might trigger a run on the pound. Inflation could overshoot the Bank of England\u2019s 13% forecast, the recession could arrive sooner and be deeper than expected. Financial markets would react badly to any social unrest that followed October\u2019s increase in the energy price cap. They are also worried about Truss\u2019s hints that she will meddle with the independence of the Bank of England.\n\nIn some ways, the struggle between Truss and Sunak mirrors that between Callaghan and Benn in 1976: one more cautious and the other more radical. With one difference. If the polls are right, this time the radical \u2013 Truss \u2013 is going to win. She aims to revitalise the right in the way Margaret Thatcher did in the 1970s.\n\nTruss\u2019s economic approach seems to owe much to Joseph Schumpeter\n\nThat will prove some task. Thatcher was leader of the opposition in 1976 at a time when postwar social democracy looked to be played out. Her argument that tough action was needed to curb inflation and union power found an echo. The country was ready for a period of austerity, even though in 1976 it had no idea just how tough the austerity would be.\n\nTruss\u2019s economic approach seems to owe much to Joseph Schumpeter, the economist who championed creative destruction as a way of constantly reinvigorating capitalism. To be sure, there is an argument \u2013 strongly made by Edward Chancellor in his new book The Price of Time \u2013 that a prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates has misallocated capital and stifled productivity growth by keeping zombie companies in existence.\n\nBut neither emotionally nor intellectually does Britain seem to be ready for a government that allows \u2013 even encourages \u2013 firms to go bust in their droves. Truss is also swimming against the tide if she thinks this is a country that would prefer cuts in taxation rather than money off their energy bills. The massive package of support provided to sustain the economy through the coronavirus pandemic set a precedent.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nSunak seems more in tune with the public mood but he, too, is an instinctive small-state Conservative trying to come to terms with the fact that this is now big-state Britain. Between 1997 and 2010, when faith in free markets and globalisation was absolute, Britain had a left-of-centre government that struggled to find a way of adapting to the prevailing orthodoxy. Since 2010 it has had a series of rightwing administrations struggling to adapt to a world that \u2013 as far as the economy is concerned \u2013 has been leaning leftwards. In their different ways Theresa May and Boris Johnson understood this, which is why they talked about helping the \u201cjust about managing\u201d and \u201clevelling up\u201d.\n\nDespite the grim outlook for the economy, there is still a possibility that the Conservatives could win a fifth term. Inflation will start to fall rapidly in the second half of next year. Growth and living standards might be rising by 2024. Voters might not be convinced that Labour would be significantly different. The election might be fought on the basis of culture wars rather than the economy.\n\nBut even to get to the stage where it is competitive at the next election, the government has to avoid a full-strength economic crisis. The choice is simple. Provide massive and speedy assistance so people can heat their homes and have a relatively mild recession, or refuse to act and have a monster recession. It is not a question of whether the winter ahead is going to be grim but of just how grim. And, if Truss wins, whether the lady is for turning.",

            "newsTextAndEnts": {
                "text": "Inflation is the top challenge facing small businesses this year, according to a report issued by the National Federation of Independent Businesses this past month, with a whopping 91% admitting that rising prices are having either a \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d impact on their companies.\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce says that nearly seven in 10 small businesses have raised prices to cope with inflation, which is also considered their \u201cdominating challenge\u201d. Sixty-five percent of small business respondents in a Goldman Sachs study said rising input costs have forced them to raise the price of their goods and services this year, with almost 80% saying the economy has gotten worse over the past three months.\n\nIf you\u2019re having inflationary challenges in your business, you\u2019re not alone. However, there is some good news for you. And, unfortunately, some bad news. The good news is that inflation appears to be plateauing.\n\nPrices for core materials such as industrial chemicals, construction supplies, copper, aluminum, plastics, packaging, iron and steel and even agriculture products like fertilizer and processed feeds are either leveling off or not rising quickly. The price of lumber products has dropped significantly from their highs last year. Oil prices are down 30% from earlier this summer.\n\nThis is partly because the world\u2019s supply chain is beginning to show signs of normalcy (port traffic in Long Beach, California, is down to 84 ships off the coast, significantly less than during the pandemic, mass lockdowns in China have ended and the Baltic Dry Index, a key measure of freight costs and shipping demand, has fallen almost 30% since the beginning of the year). There\u2019s also been a general slowdown in the world\u2019s demand for goods which, while not great, has certainly affected prices.\n\nIt\u2019s doubtful whether the Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 regardless of the positive impact it should have on our climate and healthcare problems \u2013 will have much impact on inflation. Penn\u2019s Wharton School says that the bill would actually increase inflation until 2024 and has \u201clow confidence that the legislation will have any impact on inflation\u201d. But the good news is that government spending has significantly decreased and the Fed is no longer pouring fuel on the fire.\n\nThis brings me to the bad news: we are still struggling with rising costs and the situation isn\u2019t going to change any time in the near future. Producer prices \u2013 at 11.3% as of June \u2013 are still up well over historical levels and, because the Producer Price Index is considered a leading indicator, that means that ultimately consumer prices will remain at elevated levels for months to come. It took a year and half for inflation to reach these levels (consumer prices began rising in March 2021 and hit 7% by the end of 2021, well before Russia invaded Ukraine). It\u2019s going to take at least that long for it \u2013 hopefully \u2013 to return to the more sustainable levels we\u2019ve seen in the past. It may take even longer.\n\nThat\u2019s because there are lots of obstacles in the way of significantly taming inflation. Some economists, notably former treasury secretary Larry Summers, believe the Fed\u2019s moves aren\u2019t aggressive enough.\n\nFurther pressure from the Ukraine war could elevate energy and food prices, particularly as we head into the winter months. More Covid cases in China could once again disrupt the supply chain. Even if the world economy begins to grow significantly again in the near future, that growth could put strains on our fragile supply chains and disrupt pricing for many of the core materials we buy.\n\nSo what to do if you\u2019re a small business? You leverage your accounting and customer relationship management systems to stay on top of your product lines, customer profits and margins. You raise prices discriminately and carefully. You communicate frequently with your customers and you expand your relationship with your suppliers. You constantly hunt for other sources of supply. You try to lock in long-term contracts and, like so many big brands, practice \u201cshrink-flation\u201d, where you charge the same price for a little less product. You keep your inventories under control, your overhead low and your cash balances as high as possible.\n\nYou do all of this because, even though it has probably peaked, inflation isn\u2019t going away any time soon. It\u2019s no longer 2012, when rates hovered around 2%. It\u2019s 2022, and you can expect the prices of your core materials to remain significantly elevated for at least the next six to 12 months. My best clients are always planning ahead. So plan for that.",

                "text": "Wholesale prices fell in July for the first time in two years as a plunge in energy prices slowed the pace of inflation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday.\n\nThe producer price index, which gauges the prices received for final demand products, fell 0.5% from June, the first month-over-month decrease since April 2020, the month after Covid-19 was declared a pandemic. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting an increase of 0.2%.\n\nOn an annual basis, the index rose 9.8%, the lowest rate since October 2021. That compares with an 11.3% increase in June and the record 11.7% gain in March.\n\nMost of the decline came from energy, which dropped 9% at the wholesale level and accounted for 80% of the total decline in goods prices, which fell 1.8%. The index for services rose 0.1%.\n\nStripping out food, energy and trade services, PPI increased 0.2% in July, which was less than the expected 0.4% gain. Core PPI rose 5.8% from a year ago.\n\nThe numbers come a day after the consumer price index showed that inflation was flat in July though up 8.5% from a year ago. The easing in the CPI also reflected the slide in energy prices that has seen prices at the pump fall below $4 a gallon after hitting record nominal levels above $5 earlier in the summer.\n\n\"Cooling prices paid by producers portend a further cooling for consumer prices, as producer prices are further up the inflation pipelines,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. \"We expect producer prices to ease as supply chains improve. It could take up to three months for improved supply chains to affect prices for the end consumer.\"\n\nFederal Reserve officials are watching the inflation data closely for clues about where the economy stands after more than a year of wrestling with high inflation.\n\nBefore July's easing, prices had been running at their highest levels in more than 40 years. Supply chain issues, demand imbalances, and high amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus associated with the pandemic had driven the annual CPI rate past 9%, well above the Fed's 2% long-run target.\n\nThis week's data could give the Fed reason to dial back rate increases that have come in successive 0.75 percentage point increments in June and July. Markets are now pricing in a 0.5 percentage point move in September.\n\nA separate Labor Department report Thursday showed that weekly jobless claims totaled 262,000 for the week ended Aug. 6, an increase of 14,000 from the previous week though 2,000 below the estimate.\n\nClaims have been elevated in recent weeks in a sign that a historically tight labor market is shifting. Continuing claims rose 8,000 to 1.43 million.",

It is the Brexit right\u2019s Taliban-like belief in the righteousness of its cause that drives the party. To win, she has resolved to be its uncompromising representative, but her decision has not stopped there. The only way for a Tory leader to sustain the leadership of what is ever more obviously a deranged and factionalised political movement is to govern from the hard right. It will end in failure.\n\nThe epicentre will be the economy. Her uncontroversial stated aim is growth of 2.5%. Consensus stops there. All the mechanisms to achieve growth are drawn from the evidence-free but prejudice-rich rightwing playbook \u2013 persistently anti-Europe, obsessed with tax cuts, buying into the faith that nameless regulations are shackling business and, above all, that a weak political class, deep state and obeisance to technocrats have combined to make Britain quasi-socialist \u2013 despite 12 years of Tory rule. Truss is the insurgent carrying the Thatcherite flame who will put the world to rights.\n\nConsider her six-point plan for growth. It starts, inevitably, with a commitment to cut taxes \u201cnow\u201d. She will \u201cunshackle business from burdensome regulation\u201d buttressed by \u201csupply-side reform\u201d. She will \u201cscrap all EU-derived laws by 2023\u201d and \u201cwork with industry leaders to regulate for British businesses and consumers\u201d. She will \u201ccreate low-tax, low-regulation investment zones\u201d. And she will revisit the Bank of England\u2019s mandate so that it is better at managing inflation. It is ruinous nonsense.\n\nAll the mechanisms to achieve growth are drawn from the evidence-free but prejudice-rich rightwing playbook\n\nReality is not allowed a look-in. There is no recognition that what matters in a decade beset by a pandemic, climate breakdown, fragile energy markets and threats to food supplies is the resilience of a country\u2019s energy, public health, water and farming systems to support business and civil society, in all of which the state has to play a leadership role. There is no comprehension that today\u2019s economy is built on the \u201cintangibles\u201d of knowledge, intellectual property and digitisation for which smart regulation \u2013 not no regulation \u2013 is foundational.\n\nThere is zero acceptance of the role of city regions as growth motors, set out in the government\u2019s own levelling up white paper last December, and the vital institutions and processes that support great cities, again perforce led by the state. As British exports stagnate, there is not a nod to the role of trade as a propellant of growth. The UK, as the second largest exporter of services in the world \u2013 built on intangibles that sit behind sectors as diverse as finance and the creative industries \u2013 is locked out of the country\u2019s largest markets in Europe. It is a growth plan built on sand.\n\nSo, will revoking the remaining national insurance contribution hike (to pay for enlarging public health and social care capacity, recall) and stopping the planned corporation tax rise spur growth, at the same time retaining the four-year freeze on personal allowances, on which Truss is silent?\n\nHere, too, evidence is not allowed a look-in. Successive Tory chancellors \u2013 quasi-socialists in the absurd Truss story \u2013 have cut the UK corporation tax rate from 26% in 2010 to 19% today. Private business investment has remained stubbornly at the bottom of the G7. The key propellant of investment is not the corporation tax rate but the confidence that any investment will pay back, and in strategy-free Britain in the grip of rightwing ideology, cut off from its major market, there is little or no long-term confidence. Truss will forgo much needed tax revenue \u2013 and achieve nothing.\n\nFew directors of British PLCs have a good word for Brexit and the likelihood of trade war over the Northern Ireland protocol in private. The view is shared by the tens of thousands launching startups in an extraordinary entrepreneurial revolution centred around our 100 top universities, ranging from an Oxford that is very different to the one attended by Brexiters in the 1980s to centres of innovation such as Northumbria University.\n\nThe Tory edifice is ignorant about this enterprise revolution. In their terms, these can\u2019t be real entrepreneurs: they vote Labour, Lib Dem and Green, abhor Brexit, worry that the UK is being kicked out of the EU\u2019s Horizon programme, prize universities, want action on climate change and, for the main part, can\u2019t bear the Tory party, its press and freakish leading commentators.\n\nTruss will forgo much needed tax revenue \u2013 and achieve nothing\n\nFor what is shackling them is the lack of a British ecosystem that fosters growing companies \u2013 another deficiency that falls to the state to remedy \u2013 reinforced by trying to put the union jack on regulations and diverge from the regulatory standards in our biggest market. A classic example is the government insisting that the chemical industry should abandon its \u00a3500m-a year membership of the EU chemical regulatory system, which allows it to export to 27 EU countries and become tied to a \u00a32bn UK-only programme, which allows it to trade in one country and not to the highest safety standards. In the 2020s, regulation is a way to guarantee product standards and win market access. Badging regulation British is an expensive means to suppress enterprise.\n\nSupply-side reforms? For Truss, they seem to consist of removing the vestigial remnants of employment protection in the least regulated labour market in the OECD, permitting fracking (a non-starter because Britain\u2019s geology means the risks of damage and subsidence are extraordinarily high) and scrapping incentives to go green. Low-tax, low-regulation zones? As a wealth of evidence shows, these displace economic activity rather than create the new.\n\nDo the Tees Valley or the West Midlands want to become international showcases for industrial injury, tax avoidance and goods that are dangerous or just plain shoddy? As for blaming the Bank of England for inflation of 13%, get a life. If it had acted six to nine months earlier \u2013 which I recall almost no one urging at the time \u2013 inflation might be peaking at 12.5%.\n\nThis is populist bullshit, unless Truss has the chutzpah to raise the inflation target to 4% for a period, an intriguing idea floated by the Bank\u2019s former deputy governor Howard Davies. That is genuine outside-the-box thinking, rather than rehearsing tired Thatcherite nostrums.\n\nAll the while, British households confront energy bills of up to \u00a35,000 next year, unpayable by tens of millions \u2013 another reality ignored by the Truss camp. Truss has become very adept at saying what her audience likes to hear. It is no compass for governing.",

It's a buffered ETF using a risk reversal strategy to minimize downside while also putting a cap on gains.\n\n\"You buy TSLH, hedge Tesla, you get basically 10% on the upside, and you have a 10% floor,\" Bond explained on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" last week. \"Now what a floor is \u2013 that's a max loss of 10%. If Tesla goes down 20%, you lose 10%. If it goes down 50%, you lose 10%.\"\n\nTreasury bills make up about 90% of the hedged fund \"to construct a potential floor against significant losses on a quarterly basis,\" Innovator ETFs reported in the ETF launch news release. \"A call option spread on TSLA using FLEX options\" makes up the remainder of the fund's portfolio.\n\n\"The projected upside cap for the balance of the current calendar quarter (through September) is 8.70%,\" the company also said.\n\nIts floor resets each calendar quarter but will never surpass 10%, Bond explained to CNBC, noting the ETF's floor rested at 9.23% when it launched.\n\nThe Innovator Hedged TSLA Strategy ETF is up 5% since its launch on July 26. Meanwhile, Tesla shares are up 12% in the same time period.\n\nIt's not the first time Bond's company launched an ETF using this risk reversal strategy.\n\nInnovator ETFs started the Innovator Defined Wealth Shield ETF (BALT) last year that focusing the S&P 500 index.\n\nBut the strategy is under fire by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler released a statement not long after addressing risks that may stem from \"complex\" exchange-traded products such as leveraged or inverse ETFs, emphasizing potential issues with their short-term nature.\n\n\"These ETPs, however, can pose risks even to sophisticated investors, and can potentially create system-wide risks by operating in unanticipated ways when markets experience volatility or stress conditions,\" Gensler's Oct. 2021 statement said,\n\nGensler proposed \"potential rulemaking\" to help protect individual investors. However, Bond defended Innovator ETFs' products, suggesting buffers offer significant risk control value.\n\nThe SEC declined to provide a statement.",

                "text": "A weak yen and higher inflation have also weighed on companies. Over the last year, the Japanese currency has lost more than 20 percent of its value against the dollar. While that has been good for exporters \u2014 whose products have grown cheaper for foreign customers \u2014 it has driven up prices of imports, which have already become more expensive because of shortages and supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nWhile inflation in Japan \u2014 at around 2 percent in June \u2014 is still much lower than in many other countries, it has forced some companies to substantially raise prices for the first time in years, potentially dampening demand from consumers accustomed to paying the same amounts year after year.\n\nThe gradual return to normal economic activity produced strong growth in private investment, Monday\u2019s data showed.\n\nThe growth was driven in part by spending to improve companies\u2019 sustainability and digital infrastructure \u2014 efforts strongly promoted by government policies, said Wakaba Kobayashi, an economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research.\n\nStill, it is not clear how long that growth can continue, she said. Among many businesses, \u201cthere is a sense that the global economy is going to continue to decelerate,\u201d she said. The economies of the United States, China and Europe have slowed more rapidly than expected in recent months because of the Ukraine war, inflation and the pandemic.\n\nJapan faces other challenges both at home and abroad. Small- and medium-size enterprises in particular are likely to struggle as pandemic subsidies come to an end and foot traffic to their businesses remains below prepandemic levels.",

                "text": "A shopping cart is seen in a supermarket as inflation affected consumer prices in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., June 10, 2022. Andrew Kelly | Reuters\n\nIf inflation has been the biggest threat to U.S. economic growth, then July's data should provide signs that there's at least some relief in the pipeline. Prices were flat for the month as gauged by the items that the Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks for its consumer price index. That marked the first time the aggregate measure hadn't posted a month-over-month increase since May 2020, when the widely followed index showed a modest decline. Just a month ago, CPI posted its fastest 12-month gain since November 1982, following a trend that helped send economic growth into contraction for the first half of the year, stirring up talk of a recession. But with at least the short-term trend indicating the rate of price increases is abating, economic optimism is perking up.\n\nNo recession, for now\n\n\"The whole recession narrative really needs to be put on a shelf for now,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies. \"I think it's going to be shifting to a stronger-for-longer narrative, which is really supported by a reversal in inflation.\" Markowska, whose forecasts this year have been accurate, sees solid growth in the near term, including a 3% growth rate in the third quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow gauge, which tracks economic data in real time, pointed to a 2.5% growth rate in a Wednesday update, up 1.1 percentage points from its last one on Aug. 4. However, Markowska also expects pressures to intensify in 2023, with a recession likely in the back part of the year. Indeed, there was a little bit for both arguments in the CPI report. Most of the tempering in inflation came because of a fall in energy prices. Gasoline slid 7.7%, the biggest monthly decline since April 2020. Fuel oil tumbled 11% as energy-related commodity prices were off 7.6%.\n\nTransportation services cost increases also came off the boil, with airline fares tumbling 7.8% to reverse a trend that has seen tickets surge 27.7% over the past year. But there were few other signs of inflation declines in the report, with food costs particularly high. The food index, in fact, rose 1.1% on the month, and its 10.9% pace over the past 12 months is the highest since May 1979. That's causing worries at places such as City Harvest, which helps feed needy New Yorkers who have been hit especially hard by price surge that began last year. \"We're seeing many more children come into food pantries,\" said Jilly Stephens, the organization's CEO. \"Food insecurity had been intractable even before the pandemic hit. Now we're seeing even more people turn to food pantries because of the rising prices.\" Stephens said the number of children seeking food assistance about doubled a year after the Covid pandemic hit, and the organization is struggling to keep up. \"We're always optimistic, because we are supported by incredibly generous New Yorkers,\" she said.\n\nPeople keep spending",

                "text": "Rewind to this time last year and the UK economy was accelerating out of the biggest slump in 300 years. The year-on-year growth rate was 8.7% and there was a sense that the worst of the pandemic was over.\n\nChina had reopened its doors to the world and inflation was falling as commodity prices \u2013 from copper and oil to wheat and timber \u2013 began to tumble.\n\nThis week the outlook is very different, reflecting the high cost of the war ravaging Ukraine and the supply chain blockages that can be traced back to China\u2019s return to sporadic lockdowns of industrial centres and ports, blocking global supply chains.\n\nOfficial figures on Friday showed the UK economy contracted by 0.1% in the three months to June, and the Bank of England expects a long recession to begin in October.\n\nPart of the decline was attributed to the two bank holidays that denied employers the usual number of working days in June. The Bank of England believes the jubilee bank holidays were significant and will be offset by a symmetric bounceback in the third quarter, before a downturn gets fully under way.\n\nData on the state of the labour market, inflation and retail sales will appear over the coming days and is expected to confirm the Bank\u2019s view that economic output at the moment is flat, and that a full-blown recession will start later in the year.\n\nThe prospect of energy bills increasing further could prompt some older workers to head back to the office and factory floor\n\nOn Tuesday, job figures are expected to show that a shortage of workers has kept the labour market tight. Unemployment will remain low and vacancies will stay near record highs. Wage growth is forecast by City analysts to have stabilised since May at 6.2%, including bonuses.\n\nThe government will attempt to cast these figures as good news that reveals how government policies have supported employment.\n\nBut the jobs market is still short of about 700,000 workers, many with crucial skills, whom forecasters expected, in assessments made before the pandemic, to be looking for work in 2022.\n\nOlder workers have taken early retirement in droves, while others are still suffering the after-effects of Covid-19. EU workers denied visas have returned home. Younger workers have sought refuge in further and higher education.\n\nThis last group will return \u2013 better qualified \u2013 to seek jobs at some point. What is less clear is how many older workers will want to fill vacancies. Some analysts expect that a jump in the consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation will encourage them to look for work.\n\nWhile the CPI is forecast to remain below double figures in data out on Wednesday, Threadneedle Street officials have predicted that it will soar to 13% in October, eating further into disposable incomes.\n\nThe prospect of energy bills, which underpin the rise in CPI, increasing further in January and April next year, is another factor that could prompt some older workers to head back to the office and factory floor.\n\nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, says a mass return to work is likely to take the pressure off pay. Increases, including bonuses, have already fallen for two consecutive months from 7% to 6.2%.\n\nPay settlements, mostly agreed by large employers, are another indication that wage rises remain subdued. The median settlement held steady at 4% in June, according to XpertHR, while the permanent staff salaries balance \u2013 which offsets those firms offering higher salaries against those offering lower ones \u2013 fell from May to June and then to an 11-month low in July.\n\n\u201cThese developments should reassure the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) that wage growth is unlikely to get out of hand later this year, even as CPI inflation continues to rise. As a result, we continue to expect the MPC to raise the base rate by 0.25 percentage points, rather than 0.5 percentage points, next month,\u201d Tombs said.\n\nHe is one of several analysts to predict that falling living standards will encourage more people who have quit the labour market during the pandemic to take a job.\n\nIf this scenario plays out, there will be less pressure on Bank policymakers to raise interest rates next year. This won\u2019t mean we can recreate last years\u2019 optimism, but the recession could be shallower than expected.",

He was 59 years old.\n\nJain, who most recently served as the president of Cantor Fitzgerald, earned an MBA at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and worked at several financial firms, including Merrill Lynch, before moving to Deutsche Bank. He served as co-CEO from 2012 to 2015.\n\nJain stepped down from his role at Deutsche before his contract ended after the bank was beset by a string of regulatory issues.\n\nHis other positions included a role as an advisor at fintech company SoFi from 2016 to 2017 and as a trustee of British charity Chance to Shine.\n\n\"He believed in hard work, meritocracy, operating outside of expectations or conventional boundaries, placing family first, standing by one's roots (having turned away many attempts to Westernize him in an industry that was often homogenous), in speaking 'at the margin' rather than delivering plain facts, in wit and wordplay, in being nonmaterialistic, and in the importance of having broad-bandwidth and being a 'scholar-athlete,'\" his family said in a statement.\n\n\"We are grateful to the many people who cared for Anshu throughout his life. For us, his legacy is tenacity, honour, and love,\" the statement said.\n\nHoward Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, also released a statement about Jain's passing.\n\n\"Anshu was the consummate professional who brought a wealth of experience and wisdom to his role as President. He will be remembered as an extraordinary leader, partner, and dear friend who will be greatly missed by all of us and by all who knew him,\" Lutnick said. \"On behalf of all our partners and employees, we extend our deepest sympathies to Anshu's family and wish them peace and healing during this difficult time.\"\n\nCorrection: This article has been updated to delete a reference to Ajit Jain, who is not related to Anshu Jain.",

                "text": "Prices that consumers pay for a variety of goods and services rose 8.5% in July from a year ago, a slowing pace from the previous month due largely to a drop in gasoline prices. On a monthly basis, the consumer price index was flat as energy prices broadly declined 4.6% and gasoline fell 7.7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That offset a 1.1% monthly gain in food prices and a 0.5% increase in shelter costs. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting headline CPI to increase 8.7% on an annual basis and 0.2% monthly.\n\nExcluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core CPI rose 5.9% annually and 0.3% monthly, compared with respective estimates of 6.1% and 0.5%.\n\nEven with the lower-than-expected numbers, inflation pressures remained strong. The jump in the food index put the 12-month increase to 10.9%, the fastest pace since May 1979. Butter is up 26.4% over the past year, eggs have surged 38% and coffee is up more than 20%. Despite the monthly drop in the energy index, electricity prices rose 1.6% and were up 15.2% from a year ago. The energy index rose 32.9% from a year ago. Used vehicle prices posted a 0.4% monthly decline, while apparel prices also fell, easing 0.1%, and transportation services were off 0.5% as airline fares fell 1.8% for the month and 7.8% from a year ago. Markets reacted positively to the report, with futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 400 points and government bond yields down sharply. \"Things are moving in the right direction,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies. \"This is the most encouraging report we've had in quite some time.\" The report was good news for workers, who saw a 0.5% monthly increase in real wages. Inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings were still down 3% from a year ago. Shelter costs, which make up about one-third of the CPI weighting, continued to rise and are up 5.7% over the past 12 months.\n\nPeople shop at a grocery store on June 10, 2022 in New York City.

                "text": "The Bank of England, which has been criticised for underestimating the threat of rising inflation, last year paid out bonuses to its staff amounting to more than \u00a323m, the Observer can reveal.\n\nThis bonus pot was at its highest level for at least two years, with more than 4,260 employees receiving performance awards. Andrew Bailey, the bank\u2019s governor, was widely criticised earlier this year after telling Britain\u2019s workers that they should not be asking for big pay rises because inflation had to be kept under control.\n\nThe bank is tasked by the government with hitting an inflation target of 2%, but the current rate stands at 9.4%. Lord Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at Sheffield University, said: \u201cBonuses should only be paid for extraordinary performance, but there is no evidence the bank has delivered even an ordinary performance. They are unjustified.\u201d\n\nAll employees at the bank, with the exception of Bailey, who was appointed in March 2020, are eligible for a discretionary annual performance award. Bank officials say the vast majority of its employees do not work on monetary policy.\n\nBailey earned a package totalling \u00a3597,592 in the year to the end of February: this included his base salary of \u00a3495,000 and a payment in lieu of pension of \u00a399,000. It was reported earlier this year that he had turned down a 1.5% pay rise.\n\nBonuses should be for extraordinary performance, but there is no evidence the bank has delivered even an ordinary performance Lord Sikka\n\nThe total bonus pot paid to Bank of England staff in 2021/22 was \u00a323,325,265, up from \u00a322,080,732 the previous year.\n\nFigures disclosed to the Observer under freedom of information laws show that 34 members of staff were given awards of between \u00a315,000 and \u00a320,000.\n\nBank officials say the discretionary award budget has been 10% of the total salary bill in the past two financial years, but the number of its employees has increased. Average payouts per person fell from \u00a35,560 in 2020/21 to \u00a35,471 in 2021/22.\n\nThe bank has been criticised by MPs over its handling of inflation. Former Tory Treasury minister Robert Jenrick told the Financial Times in May: \u201cThe BoE missed the opportunity to gain control over inflation last year, arguing that it would be modest and transitory when it was clear to many of us that it would be high and longstanding.\n\n\u201cWe are now in danger of entering a new inflationary era. Having acted too little, too late, there is a risk of overcompensation if it pursues significant further interest rate raises.\u201d\n\nLiz Truss, foreign secretary and frontrunner in the race to become the next prime minister, has said she wants to review the mandate of the Bank of England. Bailey has said it is critically important that central banks maintain their independence.\n\nThe Bank of England declined to comment.",

A signing bonus is a financial sweetener \u2014 often a lump sum of cash \u2014 that businesses offer prospective hires. Offers vary widely by company and position, and they can be quite generous. For example, Walgreens is offering a $75,000 signing bonus to pharmacists in some areas to reduce staffing shortages, according to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal. More from Personal Finance:\n\n5 ways to avoid debt collection scams\n\nTop tips to save on back to school shopping\n\nInflation Reduction Act extends $7,500 tax credit for electric cars In July, 5.2% of all job postings advertised a signing bonus, a slightly lesser share than the 5.5% peak in December but still about triple the level in July 2019, according to an analysis of internal data by career site Indeed. That suggests employers are competing to fill open jobs at a time when workers are still \"in the driver's seat,\" according to AnnElizabeth Konkel, an economist at Indeed. \"If employers could find workers a dime a dozen, I don't think they'd be using signing bonuses in this way,\" Konkel said.\n\n8 job sectors advertising the most signing bonuses\n\nThe trend is more prevalent among in-person health-care jobs, like nursing, dental, medical technicians, physicians and surgeons, and home health care, according to Indeed data. More than 10% of jobs ads in these respective categories offered a signing-bonus benefit in July. For example, the share of job listings advertising these bonuses jumped from 6% to 18% in the three years from July 2019 to July 2021, according to Indeed. Here are the top eight occupational sectors that advertised a signing bonus in July 2022, according to Indeed. Nursing: 18.1% of all job listings Driving: 15.1% Dental: 14.7% Veterinary: 13.5% Medical technician: 12.6% Physicians and surgeons: 11.4% Childcare: 11.3% Personal care and home health: 11.3%\n\n'Demand for workers is still going strong'\n\nWorkers have enjoyed the benefits of strong labor market since early 2021, when businesses were ramping up hiring as they re-opened more broadly after a pandemic-era lull. Job openings soared to record highs and wages grew at the fastest pace in decades, incentivizing employees to quit in record numbers and find better-quality or higher-paying work elsewhere.\n\nWorkers have the ability to negotiate whatever they choose to negotiate. AnnElizabeth Konkel economist at Indeed\n\nDespite cooling in recent months, the trend known as the Great Resignation or the Great Reshuffle remains in full swing, according to labor economists. Though surveys suggest some workers later regretted their decision if their new gig didn't live up to expectations, for example. The July jobs report issued last week beat expectations and the U.S. unemployment rate has fallen back to its pre-pandemic level, which had been the lowest since 1969. \"Demand for workers is still going strong, so workers have the ability to negotiate whatever they choose to negotiate,\" Konkel said. \"Maybe that's a signing bonus, maybe that's asking for a higher hourly wage, maybe that's flexibility, maybe that's a particular benefit.\"\n\nNegotiating a signing bonus: 'Make them love you'\n\nLjubaphoto | E+ | Getty Images\n\nThere are a few ways workers can think about negotiating a signing bonus \u2014 or a better offer if one is already on the table. First, think about the money you may be leaving on the table at your current employer, according to Mandi Woodruff-Santos, a career and money coach. She has estimated that negotiating signing bonuses added $160,000 to her income over a 10-year period. That category might include unvested 401(k) match funds or stock options \u2014 money that isn't yet yours but would be if you stayed at your current job. It may also include tuition reimbursement or a signing bonus your current employer paid, but which you'd have to pay back if you don't meet certain contractual obligations such as employment duration. Add this all up, and you can use this sum to negotiate for a signing bonus of that amount with a prospective employer, said Woodruff-Santos, who founded MandiMoney Makers, a group coaching community for women of color.",

Olga Maltseva | Afp | Getty Images\n\nFood prices dropped significantly in July from the previous month, particularly the costs of wheat and vegetable oil, according to the latest figures from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. But the FAO said that while the drop in food prices \"from very high levels\" is \"welcome,\" there are doubts over whether the good news will last. \"Many uncertainties remain, including high fertilizer prices that can impact future production prospects and farmers' livelihoods, a bleak global economic outlook, and currency movements, all of which pose serious strains for global food security,\" FAO chief economist Maximo Torero said in a press release. The FAO food price index, which tracks the monthly change in the global prices of a basket of food commodities, fell 8.6% in July from the month before. In June, the index fell just 2.3% month on month. However, the index in July was still 13.1% higher than July 2021.\n\nPrices in the short term may fall further, if futures are anything to go by. Wheat, soybean, sugar, and corn futures have fallen from their March highs back to prices seen at the start of 2022. For example, the wheat contracts closed at $775.75 per bushel on Friday, down from a 12-year high of $1,294 in March, and around the $758 price set in January.\n\nWhy prices fell\n\nAnalysts cited a mix of both demand and supply reasons for the slide in food prices: Ukraine and Russia's closely watched agreement to resume exports of grain through the Black Sea after months of blockade; better-than-expected crop harvests; a global economic slowdown; and the strong U.S. dollar. Rob Vos, the director of markets, trade and institutions at the International Food Policy Research Institute, pointed to the news that the United States and Australia are set to deliver bumper wheat harvests this year, which will improve supply since shipment from Ukraine and Russia have been curtailed. The higher U.S. dollar also lowers the price of staples, since commodities are priced in U.S. dollars, Vos said. Traders tend to ask for lower nominal dollar prices of commodities when the greenback is expensive. The widely heralded U.N.-backed deal between Ukraine and Russia also helped to cool the market. Ukraine was the world's sixth-biggest wheat exporter in 2021, accounting for 10% of global wheat market share, according to the United Nations. The first shipment of Ukrainian grain \u2014 26,000 tons of maize \u2014 since the invasion left the country's southwestern port of Odesa last Monday.\n\nSkepticism over Ukraine-Russia deal\n\nGlobal skepticism over whether Russia will keep its end of the bargain hangs in the air. Russia fired a missile onto Odesa just hours after the U.N.-brokered deal in late-July. And freight and insurance companies may still think it's too risky to ship grain out of a war zone, Vos said, adding that food prices remain volatile and any new shock can cause more price surges. \"To make a difference it will not be enough to get a few shipments out, but at least 30 or 40 per month to get the existing grains stored in Ukraine out, as well as the produce of the upcoming harvest,\" said Vos. \"To help stabilize markets, the deal will need to hold in full also during the second half of the year since that is the period where Ukraine does most of its exports.\"\n\nEven with the existing agreement, arable Ukrainian land may continue to be destroyed \"for as long as the war continues,\" which will result in even less crop yield next year, Carlos Mera, the head of agri commodities market research at Rabobank, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Europe\" last week. \"Once this [grain] corridor is over, we might see even more price increases going forward,\" Mera said. Consumers could also see further price increases as there is normally a lag of three to nine months before a movement in commodity prices is reflected on supermarket shelves. Then there is the pressure of exporting enough grain as quickly as possible from a war zone. \"It's time that we're working again. I don't see us exporting two [to] five million tons per month out of these Black Sea ports,\" John Rich, the executive chairman of Ukrainian poultry giant Myronivsky Hliboproduct (MHP), told CNBC's \"Capital Connection\" on Monday. \"Hungry people, at the end of the day, get hungry very quickly after a week.\" In a note published earlier this month, credit rating agency Fitch Ratings' analysts wrote that a possible increase in fertilizer prices, which fell recently \u2014 but which are still double that of 2020 \u2014 could cause grain prices to jump again. Russia's restriction of gas supply has led European natural gas prices to spike. Natural gas is a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers. La Nina weather patterns could disrupt grain harvests later this year as well, they added.\n\nAnd the fall in food prices is not all good news. Part of the reason why staples have become cheaper is that traders and investors are pricing in recessionary fears, the analysts said. The global manufacturing purchasing managers' index has been in decline, while the U.S. Federal Reserve seems bent on raising interest rates to curb inflation even if it triggers a recession, the Fitch team wrote.\n\nFood staples",

                "text": "City bankers are ruining your life again. They just can\u2019t help it. Rescued from collapse in 2008 and force fed a healthy financial diet ever since, the industry is now in fine fettle. And with a deluded display of arrogance only they can muster, bankers have come to see themselves as a force for good, especially in these troubled times.\n\nTheir sizable reserves are largely intact and the hazardous operations that caused so much trouble more than a decade ago are overseen by tough regulators.\n\nUnable to indulge in their usual risky behaviour, they have been allowed to revive one pre-crash habit \u2013 dishing out huge bonuses to their directors, traders, derivatives brokers, marketing executives and pension fund managers.\n\nCity bonuses in February and March this year were the largest in cash terms on record, driving the gap between pay with and without bonuses to its highest-ever level. By the time figures for the year to May came out, total pay including bonuses in finance and insurance was up 13.6%, down only marginally from a peak of 15.4% in the year to March.\n\nThe consultancy CEBR said that a closer look at the figures found that in May, workers in the top 1% of earners, most of them in the financial sector, enjoyed pay packages more than 10% larger than the year before, while those in the bottom 20% received just 1% extra.\n\nThere were some other winners in the race for higher pay, including construction workers, HGV drivers and hospitality workers. But these rises can be attributed to Brexit-related staff shortages, and the increases, while substantial in percentage terms in some cases, are often from a very low base.\n\nBank of England researchers predict average pay growth reaching 5.25% this year, 7.75% points short of its 13% forecast for peak inflation\n\nThe stench of injustice generated by a City bonus culture \u2013 one that shows again how bank profits are considered a private affair while losses are society\u2019s problem \u2013 should trigger a wave of angry protests. However, there is a wider point, and that is the way pay and bonuses in the finance sector have exaggerated average earnings data, apparently tricking policymakers into thinking everyone is enjoying a pay bonanza.\n\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey is guilty of this: he has repeatedly implied that workers are so secure in their jobs now the unemployment rate is down to 3.8% \u2013 its lowest in 40 years \u2013 that they will bid up their wages across the board. He first turned on workers in February when he said there should be \u201cquite clear restraint\u201d in the annual wage-bargaining process between staff and their employers to help prevent an upward spiral in prices. Bailey suffered withering criticism from union leaders, and even a rebuke from an embarrassed No 10, at the time under the Partygate cosh and keen not to upset the electorate any further.\n\nYet that didn\u2019t stop him repeating the message in May, telling MPs that workers should \u201cthink and reflect\u201d before asking for pay rises. He added a plea directed at high earners, who he said should consider the impact of inflation before seeking big increases. He capped his own salary at \u00a3575,000.\n\nUnderstandably, the reference to high pay was laughed at by unions unable to secure higher than a 2% average increase in February \u2013 a figure that has since risen to only 4%. Average pay increases across all industries averaged 4.3% in May, up from 4.2% in April.\n\nBailey defended himself, saying his regional agents had warned of big pay rises coming down the track. Without his calls for restraint, the six consecutive interest rate rises since December might not be enough to head off further rises in inflation, even if energy prices came down.\n\nMaybe the regional agents were focused on some of the UK\u2019s largest employers, who face strikes over pay. Recent ballots by postal workers and railway staff, with nurses to follow, may represent the beginning of a mass pay revolt, but another arm of Bailey\u2019s empire, his research department, predicts average pay growth reaching only 5.25% by the end of this year, 7.75 percentage points short of its 13% forecast for peak inflation.\n\nSo why, when pay growth is low everywhere except the finance industry and businesses affected by Brexit-related staff shortages, are the rest of the population being told their salary increases are so high that borrowing costs must rise?\n\nNot only do higher mortgage costs hit millions of homebuyers, but the effects also bleed into rents, because so many landlords have bought properties with huge loans. Higher borrowing costs will weigh on all household spending and business investment, pushing the economy into a deeper recession than is already on the cards.\n\nDamn those City bankers, and shame on the central bank for ignoring the bad smell under its nose.",

The New York Federal Reserve's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations showed that respondents expect inflation to run at a 6.2% pace over the next year and a 3.2% rate for the next three years. While those numbers are still very high by historical standards, they mark a big drop-off from the respective 6.8% and 3.6% results from the June survey. Through June, food prices rose 10.4% over the past year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They are still expected to climb 6.7% over the next 12 months, but that's a decline from the June survey of 2.5 percentage points, the biggest fall in a data series going back to June 2013.\n\nLikewise, respondents see gas prices, which rose 60% over the past year, increasing at just a 1.5% pace over the next year, a slide of 4.2 percentage points from June, the second-biggest monthly decline in the survey's history. The price of regular gas has come down about 67 cents a gallon over the past month though it remains 87 cents higher than a year ago, according to AAA. Commodity prices overall have been falling significantly as well. Finally, home prices are expected to rise 3.5% from June's 4.4%, the lowest projected gain since November 2020. Five-year inflation expectations also slipped, dropping 0.5 percentage point to 2.3%.",

The furnaces reach temperatures of 1,130C and are capable of churning out 40,000 roof tiles a day. Now Alex Patrick-Smith, the 217-year-old company\u2019s managing director, faces the prospect of being forced to switch this nonstop operation off.\n\nDreadnought belongs to a select group of the UK\u2019s heaviest power users, manufacturers that employ about 210,000 people and contribute \u00a329bn to the economy.\n\nFrom steelmakers and chemical firms to glass and ceramics manufacturers, the biggest players in this group suck up huge amounts of energy. The sector accounts for about 16% of Britain\u2019s energy usage, behind transport and domestic use.\n\nThe energy crisis has brought two black clouds on to the horizon for these companies \u2013 further rises in sky-high bills, and then the prospect of government-enforced shutdowns. In officials\u2019 worst-case winter projections, energy-intensive businesses would be asked to close to preserve power for hospitals, emergency services and households if a cold snap in the weather combines with gas shortages to trigger blackouts.\n\nPatrick-Smith says: \u201cWe keep being reassured that there are no prospects of shortages of gas, and that we have multiple sources of supply within our own gift. But this argument rests on the basic premise that it is energy security at any price \u2013 that just doesn\u2019t work in reality, because there comes a point where you just cannot afford to buy it.\u201d\n\nThe government announced on Friday that it would consider increasing subsidies for some of the biggest energy users. It already offers discounts on renewable energy levies to big energy users in the steel, paper, glass, ceramics, and cement industries. Under the consultation, that discount could rise from 85% to 100%. However, only about 300 businesses, typically the largest users, will benefit.\n\nTiles and a kiln at the Dreadnought factory, which under normal circumstances runs 24 hours a day.\n\nPatrick-Smith\u2019s monthly energy bill increased to \u00a3147,000 in June, from \u00a358,000 the same month a year earlier. From next March, this could exceed \u00a3400,000 and, without government intervention, the company may have to trim its workforce.\n\n\u201cIf we are putting sanctions on Russia then we need to acknowledge this is an economic war and, without support, there are lots of energy-intensive businesses that are going to find it very, very difficult to continue,\u201d he said.\n\nMany smaller manufacturers face an imminent reckoning when long-term hedging contracts, signed before the current energy prices were even imaginable, expire this autumn. With companies unlikely to want to fix at current high prices, they will be become exposed to the vagaries of volatile markets.\n\nIn October, Nuneaton\u2019s Subcon Laser Cutting will come off a fixed energy contract that has been in place for five years, moving to a flexible deal that will see bills increase by up to five times. Its lasers cut items ranging from car parts to bespoke clock faces. Matt Brown, who runs the family business with his parents, said: \u201cThis energy crisis is cataclysmic for industry and there is no end in sight. It seems to be getting worse and worse, and businesses just cannot afford it.\u201d\n\nBrown said he expected his monthly energy costs to increase from between \u00a315,000 and \u00a320,000 to more than \u00a350,000 a month.\n\nTom Stokes, who manages the family firm John Stokes Chrome, expects to pay a similar sum. That is well over double the amounts he paid \u2013 which were usually between \u00a318,000 and \u00a323,000 \u2013 under a fixed-rate contract that ended in June. Now his company, which turns over about \u00a32.5m a year, will have to find an extra \u00a3300,000 at current rates \u2013 if prices do not rise even further. \u201cI\u2019ve got a factory full of work and I can\u2019t make it pay,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely barmy.\u201d\n\nThe company, based in the West Midlands town of Tipton, needs large amounts of energy to run electric current through metal components in an acid bath to deposit a thin layer of shiny and hard-wearing chromium on the surface. Spiralling energy prices mean Stokes may have to soon limit operations only to higher-margin bespoke work, to avoid making losses on every job.\n\nHe has already had to raise prices by 19% to electroplate components eventually used in cars, planes, hydraulics and the defence industry. That had prompted \u201cdifficult conversations\u201d, he said.\n\nLarger industrial users have longer-term contracts in place. The listed brickmakers Ibstock and Forterra have said they have hedged 90% and 85% of their energy requirements respectively for the remainder of the year. Many factories have teams dedicated to minimising energy usage, which \u2013 along with labour and materials \u2013 is typically among their biggest costs.\n\nUK steelmakers estimate they are paying 61% more for power than German competitors. Photograph: Monty Rakusen/Getty Images/Image Source\n\nBritain\u2019s industrial titans will also be closely watching the difference in energy costs between the UK and Europe. Industry body UK Steel estimated British producers paid 61% more for electricity than their competitors in Germany and 51% more than in France. It said domestic players had paid an extra \u00a390m this year, and \u00a3345m over six years \u2013 the equivalent of almost two years of capital investment in the sector.\n\nUK Steel\u2019s head of policy, Richard Warren, said: \u201cUK steelmakers face far higher electricity costs than their European competitors, even given the global rise in wholesale prices. The government should swiftly move to implement measures to reduce policy and network costs.\u201d\n\nCompanies want a beefed-up successor to the retiring Triad scheme, which was designed to help big companies avoid using energy at peak times.\n\nManufacturers have few options to cut their existing use. Many already run night shifts to take advantage of cheaper market rates \u2013 but for smaller firms, the cost of paying higher wages to encourage employees to work unsociable hours is prohibitive.\n\nThe energy crisis has also sharpened the focus on investing in more efficient machinery.\n\nSubcon has moved away from older machines with CO 2 -based lasers to newer fibre ones. Stokes is also looking at ways to reduce his energy use by investing in new machines. His company has joined a group of smaller companies which have banded together to buy energy at points in the day when it is cheaper \u2013 an option usually only available to larger firms. The group\u2019s buying is managed by a consultancy, Control Energy Costs.\n\nBrown believes that a price cap, akin to the curbs on domestic bills, should be introduced for businesses. \u201cThe focus has been on domestic customers, but if businesses aren\u2019t here in the next five years, there\u2019ll be no jobs for these people,\u201d he says.\n\nThe government said last week that \u201chouseholds, businesses and industry can be confident they will get the electricity and gas they need\u201d, but concerns over winter blackouts persist.\n\nTata Steel, owner of the vast Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales, said the company was following the situation \u201cvery closely\u201d, although its operations were unlikely to be affected. Existing rules mean if government orders businesses to close, operations that could be irreparably damaged and have an asset value of more than \u00a350m \u2013 which include blastfurnaces and steel plants \u2013 are exempt.\n\nPatrick-Smith argues a \u201cfurlough-style\u201d scheme needed to be implemented to protect jobs if companies are asked to shut. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of overheads \u2013 insurance, rent \u2013 which we still have to pay if we\u2019re shut down. But ultimately it\u2019s people the government needs to support.\u201d\n\nStokes adds: \u201cIn this very scary geopolitical environment we\u2019ve got a very big concern as a sector that if there\u2019s not action now, we won\u2019t have a sector left. How many gut punches are we going to have before we say, you know what, they\u2019ll be closing the doors?\u201d",

But he noted that, \"I'd like to see a period of sustained inflation under control, and until we do that I think we're just going to have to continue to move rates into restrictive territory.\"\n\nHeadline consumer prices were flat in July while producer prices declined 0.5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nHowever, that was just one-month's data: CPI still was up 8.5% on a year-over-year basis, and the producer price index climbed 9.8%. Both numbers are still far above the Fed's 2% long-run inflation objective, so Barkin said the central bank needs to keep pushing forward until it achieves its goal.\n\n\"You'd like to see inflation running at our target, which is 2% at the PCE, and I'd like to see it running at our target for a period of time,\" he said. The Fed uses as its preferred gauge the personal consumption expenditures price index; June headline PCE ran at a 6.8% annual rate while core excluding food and energy was at 4.8%.\n\nBarkin's comments reflect those of most Fed officials who have spoken recently about rates.\n\nThe central bank has hiked its benchmark borrowing rate 0.75 percentage point at each of its last two meetings. Markets are divided over whether the Fed will increase by three-quarters of a point in September or scale down to half a point, with traders tilting slightly toward the latter, according to CME Group data Friday morning.\n\nWhichever is the case, Barkin said acting aggressively now is important. He said his constituents are deeply concerned about inflation and want action from the Fed.\n\n\"Consumers really dislike inflation, and one message that I get loud and clear as I wander around my district is, 'we don't like inflation,'\" he said.",

As it turns out, the millions of dollars and years of frustration meant that when Estonia and Finland agreed in April to share the cost of renting an L.N.G. processing vessel and build floating terminals, the preliminary research and development was already done.\n\nIn the months leading up to Russia\u2019s invasion, Mr. Haal said, soaring gas prices had already begun to change the economics of investing in an L.N.G. terminal. Now, his major concern is ensuring that the Estonian government completes the pipeline connection to the national gas network on time.\n\nOver the years, the question of building more L.N.G. facilities \u2014 in addition to the two dozen or so already in Europe \u2014 has been repeatedly debated in ports and capitals. Opponents argued that shipping the chilled, liquefied natural gas was much more expensive than the flow from Russia. The required new infrastructure of port terminals and pipes aroused local opposition. And there was resistance to investing so much money in a fossil fuel that climate agreements had eventually targeted for extinction.\n\nOne of the countries saying no was Europe\u2019s largest economy, Germany, which was getting 55 percent of its gas from Russia.\n\n\u201cThe general overview was that Europe had more L.N.G. capacity than it needs,\u201d said Nina Howell, a partner at the law firm King and Spalding.

Gannet77 | Getty Images\n\nBritain's Post Office, which offers banking services as well as mail, handled a record \u00a3801 million ($967 million) in personal cash withdrawals in July. In total, more than \u00a33.3 billion in cash was withdrawn and deposited over the Post Office's counters \u2014 the first time the amount has crossed the \u00a33.3 billion threshold in its 360-year history. Personal cash withdrawals were up almost 8% month on month at \u00a3744 in June, and up over 20% from a year ago to \u00a3665 million in July.\n\nStaycations and budgeting\n\nThe spike in cash use is down to several factors. \"Firstly, more people use cash when they go on staycation, secondly, the Post Office helped to hand out support to energy customers in the form of cash, and thirdly, people are using it as a budgeting method,\" said Laura Suter, head of finance at AJ Bell. The Post Office research found that 71% of Brits planning to go on holiday in the U.K. this year intend to take out cash before doing so. Of those who have holidayed in the U.K. in the last five years, almost a third admitted to being caught out by not having cash on them. In July, the Post Office processed more than 600,000 cash payouts for people eligible for energy bill support from the British government. That came to around \u00a390 million and allowed people to pay energy bills, top up gas and electricity meters or use cash for easier budgeting. In total, \u00a33.31 billion in cash deposits and withdrawals were processed at the Post Office in July, \u00a3100 million higher than in June. The data comes as the country continues to grapple with rising inflation. The Bank of England expects headline inflation to peak at 13.3% in October and to remain at elevated levels throughout much of 2023.\n\nIs it here to stay?",

                "text": "Rail passengers are facing disruption as train drivers at nine operating companies stage a 24-hour strike, halting services in many parts of England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nThe strikes on Saturday affect nine train companies and come after the union said operators had failed to make a pay offer in line with the increase in the cost of living.\n\nThousands of members of the Aslef union are on strike in the latest industrial action in a deadlocked dispute over pay and \u201cmodernisation\u201d on the railway.\n\nThe strike has stopped most intercity trains between London and the Midlands, northern England and Scotland, and into south Wales. Parts of the UK, including the West Midlands, south-west England and Kent, have no trains running on Saturday.\n\nThe Aslef general secretary, Mick Whelan, confirmed talks would take place with employers but warned that rail companies were prevented from offering a pay increase of more than 2% without permission from the government.\n\n\u201cWe find ourselves in a position where we are saying: \u2018That won\u2019t be enough.\u2019 They say: \u2018It\u2019s down to the government\u2019; we talk to the government and they say: \u2018You have got to talk to the employers,\u2019 and then we end up with a situation where it goes round and round in circles,\u201d he told the Today programme.\n\nIt comes as Grant Shapps seeks to crack down on unions with new legislation in the next session of parliament despite questioning the impact of industrial action.\n\nMick Whelen, general secretary of Aslef, joins the picket at Paddington Station. Photograph: Vuk Valcic/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nSpeaking to the Telegraph, the transport secretary said union bosses were \u201cmotivated by some outmoded class war that hankers after days that have gone\u201d.\n\n\u201cMuch to their upset, they\u2019re not bringing the country to a standstill because people are able to work from home,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe world has changed. It\u2019s moved on. These union bosses are dinosaurs who haven\u2019t realised that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People are now saying: \u2018this is about me.\u2019\u201d\n\nAslef represents 96% of train drivers in England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nDrivers are striking at Arriva Rail London, Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Greater Anglia, Great Western Railway, Hull Trains, London North Eastern Railway (LNER), West Midlands Trains and Southeastern.\n\nThe strike means no trains are running at all on Saturday on London Overground, CrossCountry, Southeastern, West Midlands Trains, London Northwestern Railway and Avanti West Coast.\n\nVery limited services are running on Hull Trains, Great Western Railway, LNER and Greater Anglia\u2019s network, including the Stansted Express airport service.\n\nSaturday\u2019s action is the first in a week of strikes by four separate transport unions that will severely curtail rail services. Trains will also be disrupted for four days starting on Thursday, as 40,000 members of the RMT union at Network Rail and 14 train operators stage two 24-hour strikes on 18 and 20 August. Several thousand TSSA members at Network Rail and seven train operators will also take action the same day.\n\nThe lack of signallers will allow only about a fifth of the usual timetable to run on strike days, while services are not expected to resume properly until late morning on the following days.\n\nLondon transport will also be disrupted on the day between the national rail strikes, 19 August, when RMT members and some Unite members at Transport for London and London Overground will strike. Most tube and London Overground services in the capital will not run. Parts of the city will also be left without buses, as 1,600 drivers in west London in the Unite union will go on strike for two days from 19 August.",

                "text": "\u201cOn the surface, this is good news for the Fed,\u201d said Omair Sharif, founder of Inflation Insights. \u201cThis is the first baby step toward the moderation they want to see on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nInflation F.A.Q. Card 1 of 5 Inflation F.A.Q. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. Inflation F.A.Q. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Inflation F.A.Q. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. Inflation F.A.Q. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Inflation F.A.Q. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFed officials remain committed to wrestling America\u2019s rapid inflation lower, and they have raised interest rates at the quickest pace since the 1980s to try to slow the economy and bring supply and demand into balance \u2014 making supersize rate moves of three-quarters of a percentage point at each of their past two meetings. Another big adjustment will be up for debate at their next meeting in September, policymakers have said.\n\nBut investors interpreted July\u2019s unexpectedly pronounced inflation slowdown as a sign that policymakers could take a gentler route, raising rates a half-point next month. Stocks soared more than 2 percent on Wednesday, as Wall Street bet that the Fed might become less aggressive, which would decrease the chances that it would plunge the economy into a recession.\n\n\u201cIt was as good as the markets and the Fed could have hoped for from this report,\u201d said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies. \u201cI do think it removes the urgency for the Fed.\u201d\n\nStill, officials who spoke on Wednesday remained cautious about inflation. Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, called the report the \u201cfirst hint\u201d of a move in the right direction, while Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that it was \u201cpositive\u201d but that price increases remained \u201cunacceptably high.\u201d\n\nPolicymakers have been hoping for more than a year that price increases will begin to cool, only to have those expectations repeatedly dashed. Supply chain issues have made goods more expensive, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sent commodity prices soaring, a shortage of workers pushed wages and service prices higher and a dearth of housing has fueled rising rents.",

He could have pointed to many more such forecasting failures, since there has never been a correct econometric forecast of a macroeconomic turning point. The question is, of course, why? Here is one answer.\n\nThe relevant macroeconomic theories all assume that no one ever trades or communicates directly with anyone else. What happens if people do trade directly, and generally communicate with one another? We know from a different kind of modelling that evidence-based assumptions of social interactions lead to episodes of volatility that cannot be forecast.\n\nThese models (which come under the rubric of complexity modelling) generate volatile outcomes of the sort classified by economists as \u201coutliers\u201d. These are dismissed by economists and economic forecasters as being one-off, externally generated events that are not part of normal economic processes. They have to dismiss these \u201coutliers\u201d because otherwise they cannot apply statistical theory to the data. The laws of statistical probability underlying econometrics are not relevant.\n\nEconomists claim that their theories and methods are tested by the accuracy of their predictions and not by the realism of their assumptions. In fact, more realistic assumptions about social and economic interaction lead to (and explain) the correct prediction that their models cannot forecast turning points such as the 2008 crash and the current economic crisis.\n\nThat is why economists have nothing useful to say about the current economic volatility, or specific proposals, such as those of Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, to address the consequences of this volatility.\n\nProf Scott Moss\n\nChapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire",

            "newsTextAndEnts": {
                "text": "The performance and mandate of the Bank of England have become central issues in the contest to succeed Boris Johnson as leader of the Conservative party, and therefore as the UK\u2019s prime minister. But with recent reviews of other leading central banks offering little guidance amid today\u2019s soaring inflation, it might make sense to revive an old idea for reforming the prevailing anchor for monetary policy.\n\nIt is not surprising that the Bank\u2019s performance is in question, given the central bank\u2019s 2% annual inflation target. With UK inflation currently running at 9.4% and expected to exceed 13% later this year, something has clearly gone wrong. But some of the Conservative leadership candidates, and notably the frontrunner, Liz Truss, have gone beyond merely criticising the Bank\u2019s governor, Andrew Bailey, for taking his eye off the ball. They talk about changing the Bank\u2019s objectives, or even its very status. Truss has pledged to alter its mandate to toughen its focus on inflation, and one of her lieutenants has asked whether the Bank is \u201cfit for purpose in terms of its entire exclusionary independence over interest rates\u201d.\n\nNo, I don\u2019t know what that means either \u2013 but it sounds threatening. Others have talked about being \u201cmore directive in setting [the Bank\u2019s] mandate\u201d and suggested that some of today\u2019s inflation has been caused by growth in the money supply. That hints at a possible reintroduction of money-supply targets, which were in vogue under Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government in the early 1980s.\n\nWhile there is no clear alternative to the Bank\u2019s inflation-targeting regime, some kind of review seems likely\n\nAs it happens, I had the grand-sounding job title of \u201cprincipal, monetary policy\u201d in the Treasury in those far-off days when the government set interest rates to meet money-supply growth targets. It didn\u2019t go so well. We tried several different measures but none were reliable. This proved the validity of (Charles) Goodhart\u2019s law: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\n\nWhile there is no clear alternative to the Bank\u2019s inflation-targeting regime, which has been in operation since 1997, some kind of review seems likely. In fact, the Bank is a little unusual among leading western central banks in not having been \u201creviewed\u201d in recent years. The Bank of Canada, for example, is subject to such an exercise every five years. The most recent review, at the end of 2021, left in place the bank\u2019s 2% inflation target, although with some new language about the emphasis policymakers should place on unemployment.\n\nIn New Zealand, on the other hand, the central bank\u2019s governance was changed significantly last year. A committee, rather than the governor acting alone, will make monetary-policy decisions, and the bank will pay more attention to house prices. Likewise, Australia\u2019s new Labor government recently launched an external review of the Reserve Bank\u2019s mandate.\n\nThe two most important western central banks \u2013 the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) \u2013 suffered nothing so undignified as an external assessment, and have been allowed to mark their own homework. The Fed\u2019s review in 2020, when US inflation was persistently low, took its mandate as given but concluded that \u201cfollowing periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2%, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for some time\u201d. The Fed has certainly achieved that over the past year, although I doubt that 9.1% annual inflation was exactly what it had in mind. I suspect that the term \u201cinflation averaging\u201d, like \u201cforward guidance\u201d, will now be put out to pasture.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s review, also undertaken against the background of stubbornly low inflation, reached a similar conclusion. The bank made its 2% inflation target symmetrical, which it always should have been, added some words about taking account of asset prices (especially housing prices), further downgraded the role of monetary aggregates, and looked forward to \u201ca transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target\u201d. On that final metric, the ECB also has in a sense outperformed \u2013 but the cure has proved even worse than the deflationary disease.\n\nSo, there is little in these other reviews that could provide a useful model for the Bank of England in the current circumstances. But there is one idea that could be worth considering, although it also was conceived at a different time and for different problems. When he was chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, Olivier Blanchard argued that a 2% inflation target was too low because there could be long periods when interest rates were at the zero lower bound, meaning that any further monetary loosening would entail quantitative easing, with uncertain results. With a 4% inflation target, those periods would be far shorter, and the monetary authorities could retain the ability to manipulate interest rates.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nOne can argue that such a change would be more suited to a time when inflation was too low. But it could nonetheless have some relevance today. Squeezing double-digit inflation out of the system will almost certainly be costly in terms of lost output and jobs. Some of the froth may disappear as energy prices stabilise, even at a high level. But getting inflation back down to 2% will be tough, given the way inflationary expectations are becoming embedded in wages and prices.\n\nWe may need something approaching the former Fed Chair Paul Volcker\u2019s double-digit interest-rate onslaught, which brought down US inflation sharply in the early 1980s. Yet even Volcker declared victory when he had reduced annual price growth to 4%.\n\nThe risk of raising the inflation target when price increases are out of control is obvious. But doing so might give central banks a bit more flexibility, and bring about a more stable monetary policy regime in the longer term, for the reasons Blanchard set out. Such an outcome would certainly be better than putting interest rates back under political control.\n\nSir Howard Davies, the first chairman of the UK\u2019s Financial Services Authority, is the chairman of NatWest Group.

                "text": "The Federal Reserve is unlikely to pivot from its hawkish interest rate hikes despite positive signs this week that inflation in the U.S. could be easing, according to market strategists. On Thursday, the producer price index surprisingly fell 0.5% in July from the prior month, compared with an estimate of a 0.2% gain, according to a Dow Jones survey. On an annual basis, the index rose 9.8%, the lowest rate since October 2021. That followed encouraging data that showed consumer prices rose 8.5% in July. The rate was slightly cooler than the 8.7% expected by analysts surveyed by Dow Jones and a slowing pace from the prior month. As both CPI and PPI soften, markets have started to moderate their expectations for Fed rate hikes. Still, the positive data doesn't mean it is \"mission complete\" for the Fed, said Ben Emons, managing director of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors. \"If you strip off any of the headline noise, some of the\u2026 CPI, even PPI [numbers] show still upward pressures,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Friday. \"The Fed cannot be done here. It probably means that the 75-basis-point rate hike remains on the table.\" \"The pricing on the Fed fund futures and euro-dollar futures shows that we're still more towards the 75-basis-point rate hike. And I think it is because of the guidance that all these Fed speakers keep giving us \u2014 'just don't be complacent here, we're going to continue,'\" Emons added.\n\nLast week, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the central bank will continue raising rates until it sees compelling evidence that inflation is falling. That message is consistent with other Fed speakers, including regional presidents Loretta Mester of Cleveland, Charles Evans of Chicago and Mary Daly of San Francisco. All of them have indicated recently that the inflation fight is far from over and more monetary policy tightening will be needed.\n\n'Not enough evidence'\n\nThe Fed raised its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point in both June and July \u2014 the largest back-to-back increases since the central bank started using the funds rate as its chief monetary policy tool in the early 1990s. Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments, said the Fed is nowhere near putting the brakes and turning dovish on rate hikes, given the current data. \"For me, there's not enough evidence for the Fed to make a huge pivot from where they are. I still think they're considering 50, 75 basis points at the September meeting,\" she told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia\" on Friday. \"Not anything coming out of the economic reports from CPI or the PPI in today's session is going to change that at this point in time. I think we still have a considerable ways to go,\" she added. Investors will be looking for guidance from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on what the Fed could do at its next meeting in September.\n\nInflation still sticky\n\nFernandez underlined the stickier parts of inflation, such as wage and rent pressures, are still high. Those are not coming down at the same rate as energy, oil and gasoline components, she said.",

Mr. Boatwright added that the company had carried out a number of changes to ensure compliance with the law, such as new time-keeping technology, and that Chipotle looked forward to \u201ccontinuing to promote the goals of predictable scheduling and access to work hours for those who want them.\u201d\n\nThe city filed an initial legal complaint in the case, involving a handful of Chipotle stores, in September 2019, then expanded the case last year to include locations across the city. At the time, the city said the company owed workers over $150 million for the scheduling violations alone. Advocates for the workers said civil penalties could far exceed that amount.",

                "text": "A person removes the nozel from a pump at a gas station on July 29, 2022 in Arlington, Virginia. Olivier Douliery | AFP | Getty Images\n\nYou'd be hard-pressed now to find a recession in the rearview mirror. What's down the road, though, is another story. There is no historical precedent to indicate that an economy in recession can produce 528,000 jobs in a month, as the U.S. did during July. A 3.5% unemployment rate, tied for the lowest since 1969, is not consistent with contraction. But that doesn't mean there isn't a recession ahead, and, ironically enough, it is the labor market's phenomenal resiliency that could pose the broader economy's biggest long-run danger. The Federal Reserve is trying to ease pressures on a historically tight jobs situation and its rapid wage gains in an effort to control inflation running at its highest level in more than 40 years.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is this gives the Fed additional room to continue to tighten, even if it raises the probability of pushing the economy into recession,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. \"It's not going to be an easy task to continue to tighten without negative repercussions for the consumer and the economy.\" Indeed, following the robust job numbers, which included a 5.2% 12-month gain for average hourly earnings, traders accelerated their bets on a more aggressive Fed. As of Friday afternoon, markets were assigning about a 69% chance of the central bank enacting its third straight 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike when it meets again in September, according to CME Group data. So while President Joe Biden celebrated the big jobs number on Friday, a much more unpleasant data point could be on the way next week. The consumer price index, the most widely followed inflation measure, comes out Wednesday, and it's expected to show continued upward pressure even with a sharp drop in gasoline prices in July. That will complicate the central bank's balancing act of using rate increases to temper inflation without tipping the economy into recession. As Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at asset management giant BlackRock, said, the challenge is \"how to execute a 'soft landing' when the economy is coming in hot, and is landing on a runway it has never used before.\" \"Today's print, coming in much stronger than anticipated, complicates the job of a Federal Reserve that seeks to engineer a more temperate employment environment, in keeping with its attempts to moderate current levels of inflation,\" Rieder said in a client note. \"The question though now is how much longer (and higher) will rates have to go before inflation can be brought under control?\"\n\nMore recession signs",

                "text": "From 3d ago 07.01 UK GDP fell 0.1% in second quarter Good morning, and welcome to our live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets. UK gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have fallen by 0.1% in the second quarter from April to June 2022, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The UK economy grew by 0.8% in the previous quarter, according to the ONS. However, economists had expected the economy to falter in the second quarter, with a poll this week predicting a 0.2% decline in UK GDP in the period from April to June. The Bank of England has already predicted the UK will enter a long recession from the final three months of this year, with the economy only growing again in the first quarter of 2024. A big reason for that expected recession is inflation and the Bank\u2019s response to it. The Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee already voted last week for the biggest rate increase in 27 years in order to try to slow the pace of price increases. Energy price rises are at the heart of the economic issues facing the UK and many other economies around the world. Annual average household energy bills are forecast to top \u00a34,200 from January and \u00a34,400 from April, according to forecasts from Cornwall Insights, a consultancy. The state of the economy and the cost of living crisis are almost certain to be the top priority for the new prime minister, either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak, once the Conservative party leadership race is decided by 5 September. Current Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said he will not take action on economic policy in his last few weeks as a lame duck leader, so as not to bind the hands of his successor. Johnson reiterated the message on Thursday in a meeting with energy company bosses, some of whose businesses have reported booming profits thanks in part to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which has raised concerns about global supplies. However, opposition politicians, union leaders and campaigners have all urged the government to speak to the two leadership contenders\u2019 teams about emergency actions to prepare for what is expected to be a very difficult winter for households. The agenda 10am BST : Eurozone industrial production (July; previous: 0.5% month-on-month growth; consensus: 0.2%)\n\n1pm BST: UK Niesr monthly GDP tracker (July; previous 0.2%)\n\n\n\n3d ago 15.03 Closing summary: The prelude to recession Is the UK economy in recession? It depends who you ask. UK GDP contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter. A second consecutive quarter would mean the UK is in a technical recession. The data on Friday were only \u201ca prelude to recession\u201d, according to economists led by Holger Schmieding at Berenberg, an investment bank. The recession is likely to last until the first quarter next year, with a peak-to-trough decline in real GDP of 2.3%. The annual growth rate for 2022 would then be 3.0%\u2013 which looks high but is driven by the 2.8 percentage point statistical overhang from 2021 with its post-COVID-19 bounce-back. In 2023, we expect GDP to decline by 1.2%, before growth recovers to 1.7% in 2024. In fact, it is a bit of a puzzle that the drop has not been more pronounced. June\u2019s 0.6% month-on-month GDP decline was comparatively modest versus drops of 1.7% and 2.2% in the jubilee celebrations of June 2012 and 2002, according to Oxford Economics, a consultancy. Andrew Goodwin, Oxford Economics\u2019 chief UK economist, said this might be explained by \u201cstructural changes to the economy, including the rise of online shopping\u201d which allow people to keep on working. Other options for why it wasn\u2019t as bad a contraction as expected might include stronger-than-thought underlying economic momentum, or that it will be revised down at the next estimate, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. June\u2019s 0.6% m/m drop in UK GDP is puzzlingly small, given that it fell by 2.2% in June 2002 & 1.7% in June 2012. There are only 3 possible explanations:\n\n\n\n1. Fall will be revised larger in time\n\n2. Econ is more adaptable now\n\n3. Jubilee hit still big but econ has strong momentum \u2014 Samuel Tombs (@samueltombs) August 12, 2022 National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) runs a \u201cnowcast\u201d for the UK economy using more timely data. For the third quarter (i.e., now), it predicts a contraction of 0.1%, with growth \u201clikely to slow further as inflation drags on consumer demand\u201d. Stephen Millard, deputy director for macroeconomic modelling and forecasting, at Niesr. It now looks like the UK economy entered a recession in the second quarter of this year as GDP fell by 0.1%, and we expect output to continue falling over the next three quarters. On the expenditure side, the fall in Q2 was driven by a 0.2% fall in consumption; on the output side, by a 0.4% fall in services, particularly, health and social work. GDP fell by 0.6% in June after a revised rise of 0.4% in May as the platinum jubilee celebrations affected the monthly profiles.

The company said that it will not return to the negotiating table having made a pay award in April - amounting to 5% on average and 8% for the lowest paid workers - which it says is the highest award in 20 years. A spokesman for BT said: We have made the best pay award we could and we are in constant discussions with the CWU to find a way forward from here. We will work to reduce the impact of any industrial action by, for example, postponing any non-essential planned engineering or software updates - similar to what we did at the height of the pandemic and as we do over holidays like Christmas.\n\nUpdated at 14.53 BST\n\n3d ago 14.37 Shares on Wall Street have gained ground as trading opens in the final session of the week.

The two 24-hour strikes by BT engineers and call centre staff belonging to the Communications Workers Union (CWU) represents the majority of the company\u2019s 58,000-strong frontline workforce. The CWU has warned that customers can expect disruption to services including repairs, having new phone and internet lines fitted or getting hold of contact and support staff. It is the second round of strikes by workers who took action on 29 July and 1 August, the first national action at the UK\u2019s largest telecoms company since 1987. BT has been in dispute with CWU, which represents about 40,000 of the firm\u2019s 100,000 workforce, which is seeking a 10% pay rise with inflation running at a 40-year high. The union represents about 9,000 call centre workers and more than 28,000 engineers at the BT-owned Openreach, which maintains the UK\u2019s broadband network. Andy Kerr, the deputy general secretary of the CWU, said: Our BT and Openreach members responded magnificently to the first strike call in July and we\u2019re confident they will be every bit as rock-solid in this second bout of action too. We remain, as ever, open to negotiations, but in the meantime we are organising and preparing to deploy our pickets all around the UK.\u201d\n\n\n\n3d ago 14.19 BT workers to strike on 30 and 31 August Striking workers picketed BT Tower at the start of this month.

The workers at the start of this month staged their first national strikes in 35 years over pay. In April, BT gave 58,000 workers a \u00a31,500 pay rise that it said was its biggest award in two decades. The CWU, which is pushing for a 10% rise at BT as inflation reached a 40-year high of 9.1% last month, described the offer as \u201cinsulting\u201d and a \u201crelative pay cut\u201d.

Photograph: Rupak de Chowdhuri/Reuters Johnson & Johnson is to stop selling and making talc-based baby powder globally, two years after it ended sales in the US and Canada, the Guardian\u2019s Mark Sweney reports. The healthcare firm has faced tens of thousands of lawsuits from consumers who allege its talc products, including the instantly recognisable brand of Johnson\u2019s baby powder, caused them to develop cancer. \u201cAs part of a worldwide portfolio assessment, we have made the commercial decision to transition to an all cornstarch-based baby powder portfolio,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cAs a result of this transition, talc-based Johnson\u2019s baby powder will be discontinued globally in 2023.\u201d In 2020, the company announced it was to stop selling the talc-based version in North America because of a fall in demand after what it said was \u201cmisinformation\u201d about the product\u2019s safety and legal challenges. You can read the full report here: Johnson & Johnson to stop making talc-based baby powder globally Read more The company has always insisted there was no link between cancers and the product, but it has faced significant pressure to stop selling the product. Antoine Argouges, chief executive of Tulipshare, a shareholder activist platform that had targeted the company on the issue, said: We are delighted that Johnson & Johnson have put people above profit today and has listened to calls to end the sale of its cancerous product. J&J continued for decades to use talc in its Baby Powder even though its own scientists warned it contained traces of asbestos. Rather than using cornstartch, as its scientists recommended, it opted for talc because it was cheaper. Today is a triumph in corporate governance and for the investors, consumers, and campaigners who all united under the umbrella of shareholder activism to make this happen. When individuals unite their collective action really can overcome the power of companies.\n\n\n\n3d ago 13.40 During the economic boom, Irish developers attempted to cash in, building tens of thousands of houses such as The Waterways, which in 2012 was an empty and unsold housing development, in Keshcarrigan, County Leitrim. Photograph: Cathal McNaughton / Reuters/REUTERS An interesting note from Ireland\u2019s Central Statistics Office: Irish house prices have finally reached the levels of the frenzy that preceded the global financial crisis in 2007. Ireland\u2019s national residential property price index (RPPI) reached 163.6 points for June 2022, \u201cequal to its highest level recorded at the peak of the economic boom, in April 2007\u201d, the agency said. Prices plummeted once the extent of the eurozone crisis became clear. Reuters reports that prices are now 123% above the crisis low point of 2013, after Ireland had been bailed out. House prices were up by 14% in Ireland in the year to June \u2013 faster growth than the UK experienced in the year to May. If it\u2019s all making you feel a bit uneasy, analysts insist that the lessons have been learned \u2013 and hopefully the boom will not result in the empty, half-finished developments that became a symbol of the crash (see the photo). Reuters reports: The system remains \u201cmuch safer\u201d than previously, Goodbody Stockbrokers chief economist Dermot O\u2019Leary said. \u201cThe macro-prudential rules are a crucial distinguishing feature,\u201d he said, pointing to the curbs that limit mortgage lending to 3.5 times a borrower\u2019s gross income. Buyers also have to have a deposit of at least 10% compared to the 100% mortgages offered during the runaway Celtic Tiger economic boom that ended in the eurozone\u2019s costliest banking rescue.\n\n\n\n3d ago 12.20 UK trade deficit remains near lowest since 1955, with 'worse to come' The UK ran up another big trade deficit in June, as the spiralling cost of gas and other products meant imports during the month were worth \u00a311.4bn more than British exports. If a country runs a persistent trade deficit it must generally fund that either by borrowing or selling assets \u2013 so it is not generally seen as a good thing to keep running growing deficits. It can also put pressure on a country\u2019s currency. Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned in 2016 that the UK relied on \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d to fund its current account deficit with the rest of the world, and that the UK\u2019s exit from the EU potentially testing that relationship. The UK\u2019s trade deficit, expressed as a share of GDP, has been larger in the first two quarters of this year than in any other two-quarter period since at least 1955, which is as far back as comparable records go, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He said: The trade data are grim, and will worsen further over the coming months, leaving sterling even more vulnerable than usual to any reduction in the willingness of overseas investors to supply the finance needed to sustain this excessive consumption. His chart shows how big the move is in historic terms: The UK's trade balance has declined to its lowest level on record in GDP terms.

Photograph: Josep Lago/AFP/Getty Images Spain has backed a call for a new gas pipeline linking it with the rest of Europe, as the EU countries examine ways to wean themselves from dependence on Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. A new gas connection linking Spain and France could be ready to operate within eight or nine months, Spanish energy minister Teresa Ribera said on Friday. Gas is generally transported via pipelines or in liquid form in massive ships. Since rthe invasion of Ukraine countries like Germany have struggled to find alternatives to Russia, on whom they have relied for abundant gas supplies, in part because of a lack of facilities to take gas off ships and into their domestic networks. However, Spain has facilities for regasification \u2013 turning liquefied natural gas back into gaseous form \u2013 which could help with importing the fuel via the sea. A turnaround of less than a year would mean the dependence on Russia could be eased before next winter (although this winter is likely to be very tough). In an interview with national TVE station, Ribera said: This new interconnection, this gas pipeline could be operating in about eight or nine months on the southern border side, that is, from the Pyrenean to Spain.\n\n\n\n3d ago 10.47 Sarah Butler Disposable barbecues will no longer be sold by major supermarkets to avoid a risk of wildfires during drought conditions. Photograph: Stephen French/Alamy Morrisons and Asda have joined Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and several other major retailers in stopping the sale of disposable barbecues as the risk of wildfires climbs during dry conditions across many parts of the UK. Both supermarkets said they were temporarily removing the product from sale in all stores because of the hot dry weather with an official drought expected to be declared in parts of south and east England today. Morrisons in March said it would remove disposable barbecues from sale within one mile of national parks to help prevent wildfires. Their move leaves Lidl as the only major supermarket chain to continue selling disposable barbecues nationwide. Marks & Spencer, Waitrose and Aldi announced they will no longer stock disposable barbecues because of the potential detrimental impact they have on the environment and wildlife. The Co-op has stopped selling them close to national parks.

Photograph: Jeff Morgan 06/Alamy The government is considering increasing the help on offer to British intensive energy users \u2013 the likes of steel, paper, glass, ceramics, and cement \u2013 as they struggle with the same surge in energy prices faced by households. The energy crisis is being felt particularly sharply by companies making materials, because there is simply no way to make them in many cases without using large amounts of energy. The government has launched a consultation into increasing subsidies. They are delivered via exemptions for some environmental and policy costs. At the moment the energy-intensive sectors are exempted from 85% of costs; that could go up to 100%. About 300 businesses would be affected, although many of them are very prominent employers in local communities \u2013 Port Talbot\u2019s steelworks are a good example.\n\n\n\n3d ago 10.07 The FTSE 100 has gained a bit of ground: it\u2019s now up by 0.5%. Gambling company Flutter is now up by 11%, with analysts focusing on the success of its US sports betting brand FanDuel. The US, which has weakened previously much stronger gambling laws, is the key focus for bookmakers, who are drooling over the prospect of taking billions of dollars from punters in the world\u2019s biggest economy. Analysts led by Ivor Jones at Peel Hunt, an investment bank, wrote: FanDuel is shooting the lights out, with a 51% sports market share, an EBITDA [earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation] profit in 2Q22, and on course to be profitable for the full year in the 2023 financial year. What once looked like unsustainable success in the US is increasingly par for the course, with positive implications for valuation.\n\n\n\n3d ago 09.30 Former British Chancellor of the Exchequer and Tory leadership candidate Rishi Sunak at the Conservative Party leadership election hustings at the The Centaur, Cheltenham Racecourse, on Thursday night. Photograph: Neil Hall/EPA If the government response will be crucial to how the UK economy fares over the winter, then this pledge from Conservative leadership candidate Rishi Sunak could be important: he has said he will spend \u00a310bn to help households with energy bills. Writing in the Times this morning, he said that he was open to \u201climited and temporary, one-off borrowing as a last resort to get us through this winter\u201d (to add to the temporary, one-off borrowing during the pandemic). Spending cuts are also on the table he said, without detailing them. That would pay for a \u00a35bn VAT on energy bills and another \u00a35bn on giving more direct support to vulnerable households. While that is less than the amount thought to be necessary by some analysts, the pledge will nevertheless likely raise pressure on Liz Truss, thought to be the frontrunner in the race to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister.

He cautions that the second-quarter GDP numbers are \u201cvery hard to read\u201d, but that he expects July GDP to rebound sharply because of the \u201cartificial\u201d comparison with the extra jubilee bank holiday. July monthly GDP will rise by roughly 0.7%, and overall third-quarter GDP by around half a percent, he reckons. \u201cA fall in fourth-quarter GDP now looks highly likely,\u201d he says, although the extent of the decline will depend on how the next prime minister responds. The Bank of England\u2019s forecasts suggest the UK is in for a long slog, although hopefully not as deep as the global financial crisis, which scarred the global economy for the next decade. The Bank of England's forecast is for a relatively shallow but long recession relative to past experiences. Photograph: ING\n\n\n\n3d ago 08.52 The ONS said that real household consumption across the quarter fell by 0.2% in the quarter, but even then there are signs that the economy has been sustained by people enjoying themselves. What happens to that spending in the next few months once the effects of inflation \u2013 particularly higher energy prices \u2013 come through? Remember, the energy price cap is due to increase from \u00a31,971 to an expected \u00a34,200 come January. That is an extra \u00a32,000 that households will just have to find (unless the government steps in with a bigger intervention), Derek Halpenny, head of research for Europe at MUFG Bank, said: This weakness in services was partially offset by activity in two areas where nearly all the services growth came from \u2013 accommodation and food service activities and arts, entertainment and recreation underlining the boost from the Jubilee celebrations. Business investment jumped 3.8% Q/Q and is a welcome stronger element of the report but follows a long period of post-Brexit weakness. The better June print doesn\u2019t change the overall backdrop and won\u2019t alter at all the BoE\u2019s outlook and hence its policy outlook. The BoE was forecasting a rebound in third-quarter GDP before we enter the five-quarter period of GDP contraction and today\u2019s data doesn\u2019t change that. Small businesses, particularly retailers, are worried. Martin McTague, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: The 0.2% real-terms fall in household consumption despite rises in outlay on housing and travel is a flashing alarm for small businesses, many of whom rely on consumer spending. With levels of fuel poverty skyrocketing, fuel and energy costs far higher than they were in the same quarter last year, and rent costs rising steadily, there is less left in people\u2019s pockets for holidays, new clothes, meals out, and other discretionary spending, leading to lower sales for many small businesses. The 1% fall in the wholesale and retail trade over the quarter is deeply concerning, with supply chain disruption causing huge headaches and extra expense for businesses.\n\n\n\n3d ago 08.32 UK economy has 'likely entered recession' - Niesr thinktank The analysts have had a bit more time to digest the figures.

Photograph: Brendan McDermid/Reuters Pharma company GSK and its recently spun-off consumer goods arm Haleon have risen this morning, bouncing after a steep sell-off related to liabilities for heartburn pills that probably contained a cancer-causing chemical. Shares in GSK and Haleon fell heavily on Thursday, by 10% and 4.9% respectively, as investors became increasingly concerned about litigation from 3,000 former users of the medicines. GSK has told Haleon that it too could be liable if the plaintiffs are successful \u2013 not an auspicious start for a newly independent company. GSK has come out swinging this morning, with a statement saying there is no link between its product and the cancers suffered by customers. It said: GSK, independent cancer researchers, the US Food and Drug Administration, and the European Medicines Agency, have all undertaken extensive reviews of available data and conducted numerous investigations into this issue since 2019. Based on these investigations and experiments, GSK, the FDA, and the EMA have all independently concluded that there is no evidence of a causal association between ranitidine therapy and the development of cancer in patients. The overwhelming weight of the scientific evidence supports the conclusion that there is no increased cancer risk associated with the use of ranitidine. Suggestions to the contrary are therefore inconsistent with the science, and GSK will vigorously defend itself against all meritless claims alleging otherwise. GSK shares gained 2% on Thursday, while Haleon rose 0.2%.\n\nUpdated at 08.21 BST",

Lucas Schifres | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 China's tourist-heavy province of Hainan is falling further behind lofty growth goals it set in January. Back then, the island said it aimed for 9% GDP growth this year. But like China's economy overall, growth is running far below initial targets \u2014 due in a large part to outbreaks of a far more transmissible Covid variant. A surge in Covid infections this month forced Hainan's oceanside resort city of Sanya to order tens of thousands of tourists to stay put at their hotels, and local residents to stay at home. Haikou, the province's capital, also issued stay-home orders. Airlines cancelled flights, leaving tourists stranded on Hainan island since Saturday. In the last few days, some people have been able to return to the mainland on government-organized charter flights. But questions remain \u2014 about uniform implementation of hotel stay subsidies, the cost of food and how soon most tourists can return to their homes.\n\n\"The public image and reputation of Hainan is damaged for the short term,\" said Jacques Penhirin, a partner in the Greater China office of Oliver Wyman. \"When I talk to the client they're all looking at the bookings for [the upcoming fall holiday] which are still quite resilient. People have not cancelled yet, but it's not looking good. Probably down on last year.\" It's \"going to be bad for luxury brands and hospitality at least until Chinese New Year next year,\" he said, referring to the Lunar New Year holiday in late January 2023.\n\nHainan's economy\n\nIn late July, China's top leaders indicated the country might miss the GDP target of around 5.5% set in March. Beijing did not signal any large-scale stimulus, or any change to its \"dynamic zero-Covid\" policy. The national economy grew by just 2.5% in the first half of the year, according to official figures. Hainan's economy underperformed even that sluggish pace, only growing by 1.6% in the first half of 2022. That's a sharp slowdown from the island's 11.2% GDP growth for all of 2021. In fact, Hainan's growth last year was second only to that of Hubei province, pointed out Ying Zhang, research analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nRead more about China from CNBC Pro JPMorgan says buy this undervalued Chinese biopharma stock that can rally more than 40% from here\n\n\"Because of the international travel restriction, Hainan has benefited from the tourism revenue, up by nearly 60% last year,\" she said. Zhang estimates tourism accounts for more than 80% of Hainan's economy. Sanya, on the southern coast of Hainan, was the top destination for couples flying from three of China's largest cities last week for China's version of Valentine's Day, according to booking site Trip.com. The island boasts one of the few beachfront locations for international luxury hotels like Mandarin Oriental and Hyatt in mainland China. Hainan is also building out duty-free shopping malls as part of central government's push to turn the island into a free trade hub and international shopping area. Sales at duty-free stores on the island surged by 84% last year to 60.17 billion yuan ($8.93 billion), according to official figures. During a consumer goods expo in Hainan in late July, sales at four duty-free stores rose by 27% year-on-year to 330 million yuan, the customs agency said.\n\nAnother hit to confidence\n\nSo far, cosmetics brands rely far more on Hainan for sales than affordable luxury brands \u2014 potentially up to a third of their China business, said Oliver Wyman's Penhirin. He said Hainan generally accounts for less than 5% of China sales for affordable luxury brands, while high-end luxury has yet to enter that market. An Oliver Wyman survey in May found that after roughly two months of lockdown in the metropolis of Shanghai, respondents from luxury and premium consumer brands cut their China growth expectations for the year by 15 percentage points.\n\nTens of thousands of tourists were stranded in the resort city of Sanya, Hainan, this week as local Covid outbreaks prompted airlines to cancel flights.

Democrats have faced a bleak outlook heading into the fall, with Mr. Biden suffering from dismal approval numbers amid soaring inflation and painful prices at the pump.\n\nMr. Biden is planning to sign a bill on Wednesday that would expand medical care for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits on military bases, another measure that Congress approved with bipartisan support. And on Friday, the House is expected to pass the climate, health and tax bill that cleared the Senate over the weekend, handing the president a legislative triumph that he and Democratic candidates can highlight in the weeks to come.\n\nThe effort to promote the recent series of victories comes after Mr. Biden was forced to isolate during a bout with Covid-19, followed by a rebound case. He left isolation on Sunday and then traveled on Monday to meet with survivors of the severe flooding in Kentucky, his first work trip since testing positive for the virus on July 21.",

There is growing evidence that people are already struggling, with the number contacting Citizens Advice because they cannot afford both food and energy having jumped more than threefold in a year, according to recent figures published by the charity.\n\nEnough is Enough is also calling for a \u201creal\u201d pay rise for workers which it defines as a public sector pay increase in line with inflation and a pathway to a \u00a315 minimum wage. The current minimum wage rate for adults aged 23 and over is \u00a39.50. It also wants the government to end food poverty by introducing free school meals for all and reinstating the \u00a320-a-week universal credit uplift.\n\n\u201cWorking people are seeing how a tiny elite want to make their lives all about working harder and longer for less,\u201d Ward said. \u201cNow that same elite is profiteering from a cost of living crisis that will drive millions into poverty with sky-high bills. Things can\u2019t go on like this: it\u2019s time to say enough is enough.\u201d\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nPublic anger is growing over the government\u2019s response to rising living costs. Earlier this year thousands of people gathered in London for a TUC rally that railed against government inaction on the cost of living crisis.\n\nMore than 100,000 people are also threatening to cancel their direct debits for gas and electricity from October in protest against rocketing energy prices, as part of the Don\u2019t Pay UK campaign.\n\nDon\u2019t Pay said it would only take action if 1 million people promise to join in and are hoping for a rerun of the poll tax protests that helped bring down Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government when 17 million people refused to pay.",

Pictured here is a residential complex under construction on Dec. 15, 2021, in Guizhou province.\n\nBEIJING \u2014 China's real estate troubles could spill into other major sectors if the problems persist \u2014 and three particular businesses are most vulnerable, according to ratings agency Fitch.\n\nSince last year, investors have worried that Chinese property developers' financial problems could spread to the rest of the economy. In the last two months, many homebuyers' refusal to pay their mortgages have brought developers' problems to the forefront again \u2014 while China's economic growth slows.\n\n\"If timely and effective policy intervention does not materialise, distress in the property market will be prolonged and have effects on various sectors in China beyond the property sector's immediate value chain,\" Fitch analysts said in a report Monday.\n\nUnder such a stress scenario, Fitch analyzed the impact over the next 12 to 24 months on more than 30 kinds of businesses and government entities. The firm found three that are most vulnerable to real estate's troubles:\n\n1. Asset management companies\n\nThese firms \"hold a sizeable amount of assets that are backed by real estate-related collateral, making them highly exposed to prolonged property-market distress,\" the report said.\n\n2. Engineering, construction firms (non state-owned)\n\n\u201cThe sector in general has been in difficulty since 2021. ... They do not have competitive advantages in infrastructure project exposure or funding access relative to their [government-related] peers,\" the report said.\n\n3. Smaller steel producers\n\n\"Many have been operating at a loss for a few months and could face liquidity issues if China's economy remains lacklustre, especially given the high leverage in the sector,\" the report said.\n\nFitch said construction accounts for 55% of steel demand in China.\n\nThe slowdown in real estate has already dragged down broader economic indicators like fixed asset investment and the furniture sales component of retail sales.",

Between those stockpiles and solid wage growth, many have been able to keep spending even as costs climb. But data and anecdotes suggest that lower-income households, despite the resilient job market, are struggling more profoundly with inflation.\n\nThat divergence poses a challenge for the Federal Reserve, which is hoping that higher interest rates will slow consumer spending and ease pressure on prices across the economy. Already, there are signs that poorer families are cutting back. If richer families don\u2019t pull back as much \u2014 if they keep going on vacations, dining out and buying new cars and second homes \u2014 many prices could keep rising. The Fed might need to raise interest rates even more to bring inflation under control, and that could cause a sharper slowdown.\n\nIn that case, poorer families will almost certainly bear the brunt again, because low-wage workers are often the first to lose hours and jobs. The bifurcated economy, and the policy decisions that stem from it, could become a double whammy for them, inflicting higher costs today and unemployment tomorrow.",

The unemployment rate is now back to its pre-pandemic level and tied for the lowest since 1969, though the rate for Blacks rose 0.2 percentage point to 6%.\n\nWage growth also surged higher, as average hourly earnings jumped 0.5% for the month and 5.2% from the same time a year ago. Those numbers add fuel to an inflation picture that already has consumer prices rising at their fastest rate since the early 1980s. The Dow Jones estimate was for a 0.3% monthly gain and 4.9% annual increase.\n\nMore broadly, though, the report showed the labor market remains strong despite other signs of economic weakness.\n\n\"There's no way to take the other side of this. There's not a lot of, 'Yeah, but,' other than it's not positive from a market or Fed perspective,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. \"For the economy, this is good news.\"\n\nMarkets initially reacted negatively to the report as traders anticipated a strong counter move from a Federal Reserve looking to cool the economy and in particular a heated labor market. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day positive, rising about 74 points following a day of choppy trading.\n\nLeisure and hospitality led the way in job gains with 96,000, though the industry is still 1.2 million workers shy of its pre-pandemic level.\n\nProfessional and business services was next with 89,000. Health care added 70,000 and government payrolls grew 57,000. Goods-producing industries also posted solid gains, with construction up 32,000 and manufacturing adding 30,000.\n\nRetail jobs increased by 22,000, despite repeated warnings from executives at Walmart, Target and elsewhere that consumer demand is shifting.\n\nA more encompassing view of unemployment that includes those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons as well as discouraged workers not looking for jobs was unchanged at 6.7%.",

                "text": "Britain\u2019s recovery from the pandemic stalled in the three months to June when the economy contracted by 0.1%, according to official figures that revealed the weakening outlook for the UK, which is expected to enter a recession later this year.\n\nExports fell and consumer spending contracted to push the UK closer to a long period of contraction that the Bank of England expects will stretch to the end of 2023.\n\nThe dip in output in the second quarter followed 0.8% growth in the first quarter and was driven by the health sector \u2013 as Covid testing and the vaccine programme was wound down \u2013 and by retail, as household spending fell, according to the figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nEconomists had forecast a bigger fall in output of 0.2% in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cHealth was the biggest reason the economy contracted as the test-and-trace and vaccine programmes were wound down, while many retailers also had a tough quarter,\u201d said Darren Morgan, a director of economic statistics at the ONS.\n\nGas and electricity drove an increase in production output in the second quarter, and construction rose, the ONS said.\n\nHotels, bars, hairdressers and wedding venues also provided a boost to counter the downward trend after they benefited from the return of outdoor events and the extended holiday for the Queen\u2019s platinum jubilee. Business investment improved by 3.6% during the quarter.\n\nHowever, a turnaround in some parts of the private sector was too weak to prevent the economy from shrinking by 0.6% month on month in June, after 0.4% growth in May, which the ONS said was explained partly by the dent to manufacturing, construction and business services from the jubilee holiday, which led to an additional working day in May and two fewer working days in June.\n\n\n\nThe Bank of England has forecast a modest bounceback in GDP in the third quarter to the end of September before a recession beginning in October that the central bank has predicted will last through 2023.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nThe National Institute of Economic and Social Research said the contraction in the second quarter meant a recession had already begun, brought about by a collapse in consumer confidence that has caused households to curtail spending, and a decline in activity across the services sector.\n\nThe cost of living crisis, as inflation heads towards 13% by the end of the year and energy bills soar, is expected to weigh heavily on household spending and pile further pressure on businesses already struggling with rising costs.\n\nThe chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, said that despite the fallout from the pandemic and high energy prices \u201cthe economy showed incredible resilience\u201d.\n\nHe said he would be working with the Bank of England to bring inflation under control and \u201cgrow the economy\u201d, adding that the government had provided direct financial support to offset the worst effects of rising energy bills, \u201cincluding \u00a31,200 for 8 million of the most vulnerable households.\u201d\n\nJames Smith, a research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cWhile the contraction in June partly reflects the timing of platinum jubilee bank holidays, the economy has started a difficult period on a weak footing. And with the Bank of England forecasting that inflation will rise above 13% in October, and that the economy will slip into recession in Q4, the outlook is bleak.\n\n\u201cThe first priority for the new prime minister will be to provide further targeted support to low- and middle-income households, who will be worst affected by the stagflation that already seems to be taking hold.\u201d\n\nExports fell by 8% in June to reverse two months of consecutive gains, the ONS said. Trade fell with the EU and the rest of the world as the trend for British goods exporters to miss out on a 20% rise in global trade during the pandemic continued.\n\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the UK was about to enter choppier waters as major economies in Europe and the US began to suffer downturns.\n\n\u201cJune\u2019s trade data ended what was a strong second quarter with a damp squib,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are gathering economic headwinds which all UK goods exporters now face,\u201d he said, which revealed the risks of \u201cweakening, instead of stabilising, trade relations with the EU\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere is now an urgent need for real delivery by the UK government\u2019s export strategy to support the growth ambitions of UK exporting businesses.\u201d",

Business investment fell in the most recent quarter. Employers are hiring, but they are leaning heavily on one-time bonuses rather than permanent pay increases.",

                "text": "LONDON \u2014 The average cost of a pint of beer in the U.K. has soared by 70% since 2008 \u2014 well ahead of inflation \u2014 and some Londoners are parting with as much as \u00a38 ($9.70) for 568ml of the amber nectar. According to figures from consultancy firm CGA, the average cost of a pint has risen from \u00a32.30 in 2008 to \u00a33.95 in 2022, though prices vary drastically across locations. Average prices rose by 15 pence between 2021 and 2022, up almost 4%, one of the largest year-on-year increases since 2008. The average price of a pint at one unnamed pub in London hit an eye-watering \u00a38.06 this year, the highest CGA has ever recorded, while the lowest nationally was a \u00a31.79 average at a pub in Lancashire, in the northwest of England. U.K. inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.4% in June and is expected to rise beyond 13% in October, compounding the country's historic cost-of-living crisis and prompting the Bank of England to implement its largest interest rate hike since 1995 on Thursday. Many pubs and hospitality venues are concerned that consumers will increasingly stay at home. Paul Bolton, client director for GB drinks at CGA, told CNBC that a combination of supply chain issues, staffing shortages, soaring energy costs, lingering pandemic-era debts and generally high inflation are increasing suppliers' cost pressures, which then have to be passed onto the consumer. Raw materials and energy Francois Sonneville, senior beverage analyst at Rabobank, told CNBC that prices are increasing throughout the value chain, starting with barley. \"The barley price has gone up, and has doubled since 2021. There's two reasons for that: one is that the harvest in North America was really poor, driven by a poor climate, so there was not much inventory to start with \u2013 and then, of course, we had the Black Sea region conflict,\" he told CNBC's Arabile Gumede.\n\nA pint of Adnams Ghost Ship Citrus pale Ale. The Suffolk-based brewer says a combination of soaring energy, labor and raw material costs is squeezing businesses and driving up the price of a pint. Geography Photos/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nHistorically, when grain prices increased, farmers would compensate by planting more the following year, but broader agricultural inflation is also putting a squeeze on farms, outpacing even the 40-year high of 9.4% headline inflation in the U.K. \"Where our normal inflation is running at 8, 9%, (agricultural) inflation for our businesses is running somewhere over 22, 23%,\" explained Richard Hirst, owner of Hirst Farms in Suffolk. \"That's a function of obviously oil prices, fuel \u2013 our tractor diesel has gone up more than three times in price, which is a lot more, relatively, than road fuel has gone up.\" Hirst said the farm is also facing substantial labor cost increases, with shortages affecting the farming industry nationwide, along with fertilizer costs. \"Fertilizer costs will have tripled for next year \u2013 we're buying fertilizer now three times what it was last year. Our chemical inputs are going up and just the cost of running machinery, whether it's spare parts or actually just the cost of buying machinery itself. All that has gone up an awful lot more than the 9 or 10% of normal inflation.\"\n\nHowever, barley is not the main cost incurred during the brewing process \u2013 in fact, it only contributes around 5% of the price of beer at the tap. The biggest costs, analysts and business leaders told CNBC, come from labor, packaging and energy. \"I think that if you look at the brewing process itself, it uses a lot of energy \u2013 and the energy price has gone up, as we all know, when we stop at the pump \u2013 but the most important one is probably packaging,\" Sonneville said. \"Packaging makes up about 25 to 30% of the cost price of beer, and glass packaging, glass bottles, use about 25% of their cost in energy, so with gas prices going 10 times higher now than they were two years ago, that has a massive impact on the cost of a brewer.\" Labor of love His comments were echoed by Andy Wood, CEO of Suffolk-based brewery and hospitality business Adnams, who told CNBC that the energy price increases the company is seeing are \"absolutely eye-watering.\" \"Brewing beer or distilling spirits involves a lot of boiling water, so that involves lots of energy to get to that state, although we've put quite a number of innovations in over the years to limit the impact of that,\" he explained. Wood said in the aftermath of Brexit and the pandemic, a tightening of the U.K. labor market is also exerting upward wage pressure, which will likely be exacerbated by the country's escalating cost-of-living crisis. \"The biggest cost that we have is our payroll because the hospitality part of that business is a people-driven business,\" he added. What's more, the geopolitical headwinds facing businesses throughout the supply chain are unlikely to abate any time soon.\n\n\"So we've got Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we've got the energy crisis that that's brought on, we've got the food supply crisis, grain, cooking oils, these types of things, and then \u2026 we hear in the media that China may be looking longingly at Taiwan, so I think the geopolitical situation is getting no easier, so I think these things are here to stay,\" he said. The question for businesses, according to both Wood and Sonneville, is how many of these costs they can absorb, how much should be passed onto consumers, and in the midst of a cost of living crisis, how to sustain margins without forcing the consumer to stay at home and jeopardizing volumes. Brewers tend to have long-term contracts and hedges in place to ensure contingency plans for future price rises, meaning not all of their costs are fully reflected at present, and therefore not immediately passed onto consumers. \"I think if you look at the price of beer that you and I pay, there is a risk that that will go higher, because there is a lagging effect of costs at the brewery because of those long-term contracts,\" Sonneville said on Monday. \"The hope that I think is there at brewers is that prices will come down. We have not seen that in gas \u2014 we've seen more sanctions there and gas prices have actually risen in the last three days \u2014 but we have seen that grain prices have come off a little bit, and the hope is that that will continue.\" Shifting trends Wood noted that consumer sentiment and behavior had already begun to shift in the face of higher prices at the bar. \"We're certainly seeing people come out earlier in the evening, having their drinks, having their dinner, and then they're going back home,\" he said. \"We're seeing people perhaps having two courses rather than three courses, and perhaps having a glass of wine rather than a bottle of wine, so we are seeing some changes in consumer behavior, there is no doubt about that.\" This was reflected in CGA's latest consumer analysis, which found that premium products and venues offering particularly unique experiences were increasing their share of the on-trade.",

He asked the oil producers present to keep investing in North Sea oil and gas, citing the UK\u2019s energy security. Johnson, chancellor Nadhim Zahawi and business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also stressed the importance of investments in renewables, biomass and nuclear energy. Some of the discussions addressed how to lower energy bills, while Zahawi is understood to have told the meeting that the government was considering measures aimed at the \u201cextraordinary profits\u201d of some parts of the electricity generation sector. In written comments after the meeting, Johnson said: Countries around the world are feeling the impact of Putin\u2019s damaging war in Ukraine. We know that this will be a difficult winter for people across the UK, which is why we are doing everything we can to support them and must continue to do so. Following our meeting today, we will keep urging the electricity sector to continue working on ways we can ease the cost of living pressures and to invest further and faster in British energy security. We are continuing to roll out government support over the coming months, including the second \u00a3324 instalment of the cost of living payment for vulnerable households, extra help for pensioners and those with disabilities, and the \u00a3400 energy bills discount for all households.\n\nUpdated at 13.54 BST\n\n4d ago 14.40 We have pictures from inside the government\u2019s meeting with energy bosses.

The latest data today suggests those pressures might be easing \u2013 even if they remain strong. The US producer price index, which measures what goods cost when leaving the factory gate, rose by 9.8% year-on-year in July, according to the US Labor Department. That is a steep increase, but less than the 11.3% recorded in June and the 10.4% that economists had expected, according to a Reuters poll. The monthly figures also showed that the index actually fell by 0.5% month-on-month. Economists had suggested that the index would rise, so that counts as a genuine surprise. Earlier this week the news that consumer prices remained flat in July sparked a relief rally on stock markets as investors entertained the hope that inflation may have peaked. That might mean that central banks do not have to raise interest rates and tip countries into recession, as is still widely expected. But beware: US Federal Reserve officials last night said the battle against inflation is far from over.\n\n\n\n4d ago 13.29 Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he will keep urging the electricity sector to cut bills after meeting energy bosses today.

In a readout from the meeting Zahawi said the companies pledged to work \u201cin the spirit of national unity\u201d. However, Johnson also told the meeting that it will be for his successor to make significant fiscal decisions, again ruling out significant policy action before 5 September. Zahawi said: This morning I hosted industry leaders from the electricity sector to discuss what more they can do to work with Government and act in the interest of the country in the face of rising prices caused by Putin\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine. We have already acted to protect households with \u00a3400 off energy bills and direct payments of \u00a31,200 for 8m of the most vulnerable British families. In the spirit of national unity, they agreed to work with us to do more to help the people who most need it.\n\n\n\n4d ago 12.50 There is a notable absence from the list of people at the Downing Street meeting between ministers and energy bosses: big oil. Neither of the UK\u2019s \u201csupermajor\u201d oil and gas companies, BP and Shell, were among the chief executives in attendance. Between them the two FTSE 100 oil producers made profits of $35bn (\u00a329bn) during the first half of the year \u2013 much of it thanks to surging oil and gas prices following Vladimir Putin\u2019s order for Russia to invade Ukraine. A chart showing that the biggest five listed oil companies\u2019 profits surged during the first half of 2022. BP talks about a \u201ccash balance point\u201d for the next few years of around $40 per barrel of Brent crude oil. That means that pretty much everything above that price is gravy. With Brent futures prices recovering to $98 per barrel on Thursday, the profits bonanza starts to be understandable. Both Shell and BP say they need the profits to make genuinely large investments in renewable energy \u2013 solar energy provider Lightsource BP is a notable example. Yet shareholder returns of $16bn this year from the two companies have far outweighed spending on zero-emissions energy. BP has committed to spending of $2.5bn this year on net zero-compatible energy. This post was amended on 12 August 2022. The boss of Lightsource BP did not attend the meeting as previously stated.\n\nUpdated at 10.34 BST\n\n4d ago 12.01 Prime Minister Boris Johnson also meeting energy company bosses Prime Minister Boris Johnson hosting a reception in the garden of 10 Downing Street on 9 August. Photograph: Peter Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also joined the meeting of energy company bosses. Johnson had not been expected at the meeting, but was a last-minute addition, it is understood. The prime minister, who will be pushed out of office by 5 September, has been criticised for refusing to act to cut energy costs in recent months.\n\n\n\n4d ago 11.55 The meeting\u2019s attendees cover a significant proportion of the UK\u2019s electricity generation abilities. They also serve many of Britain\u2019s households with gas. EDF\u2019s generators nuclear power stations generate about a fifth of the UK\u2019s electricity. Centrica\u2019s British Gas is the largest supplier of gas to UK households. Some of the companies have also been among the big beneficiaries of the energy price spike. For instance, Centrica made operating profits of \u00a31.3bn during the first half of 2022 thanks to higher prices for the oil and gas it drills. Others have not fared so well. Gas distributor Uniper required a \u20ac15bn (\u00a313bn) bailout from the German government after Russia cut back gas supplies to Europe. France\u2019s EDF Group is suing its own government for \u20ac8.3bn (\u00a37bn) after it was forced by Emmanuel Macron\u2019s administration to sell energy to consumers at a loss. The company is being wholly nationalised as part of France\u2019s effort to minimise energy bills.\n\n\n\n4d ago 11.24 Energy bosses summoned to talks with ministers The bosses of some of the UK\u2019s biggest energy companies have started a meeting with the chancellor and business secretary who are expected to pressure them to invest in green energy rather than pay-outs for shareholders. It is understood that attendees of the meeting this morning include Chris O\u2019Shea, the chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, and Simone Rossi, the boss of EDF in the UK. The government has the option of increasing taxes on energy companies, after belatedly introducing a windfall tax in response to the surge in energy prices that has driven inflation in the UK to a 40-year high. However, neither chancellor Nadhim Zahawi nor business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng are thought to favour raising taxes further, and government sources briefed last night that the talks will focus on investments and ensuring security of supply. There is a big question mark over whether investments in new projects can have any effect on the energy price increase expected over the winter. The consultancy Cornwall Insight said on Tuesday that it expected the UK\u2019s energy price cap (the annual rate paid by an average household) to reach \u00a34,266 for the first three months of next year. The meeting this morning is also thought to include the bosses of Denmark\u2019s Orsted, Germany\u2019s Eon, RWE and Uniper, and Britain\u2019s Drax and SSE. This post was amended on 12 August 2022. The boss of Lightsource BP did not attend the meeting as previously stated.\n\nUpdated at 10.25 BST\n\n4d ago 10.34 Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, speaks during the Bank of England's financial stability report news conference, on 4 August. Photograph: Reuters There is an arm wrestle ahead over regulation of the City of London. Earlier this week Conservative leadership race frontrunner Liz Truss signalled (in briefings to allies reported by the Financial Times) that she will bring in powers to \u201ccall in\u201d financial regulatory decisions if they are too cautious. Rishi Sunak previously said he would do something similar. That means both the candidates to be the next prime minister want to clip the Bank of England\u2019s wings. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has restated his position that government interference in regulatory decisions would be detrimental to the UK. In a letter to the Treasury select committee (from 27 July, so before Truss jumped on the bandwagon) Bailey wrote: Regulatory independence is important, not least because our international standing, and therefore the competitiveness of the UK financial sector which the reforms are aimed at enhancing, depends on it. Anything that would weaken the independence of regulators would undermine the aims of the reforms. File under one to watch.\n\n\n\n4d ago 09.56 UK house sales expectations fall to lowest since pandemic lockdowns - surveyor poll The UK housing industry\u2019s expectations for the year ahead are the most downbeat since the first coronavirus lockdowns began in March 2020, according to a regular poll of chartered surveyors. The balance of respondents believing prices will fall in the next 12 months rose to 36% in July, up from 21% in June, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics). Enquiries by potential new buyers dropped for the third consecutive month. Surveyors' expectations of house price sales numbers for the year ahead are falling. Photograph: Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) The surveyors blamed the prospect of higher interest rates and the cost-of-living crisis for the drop in demand: if borrowing is more expensive as the Bank of England battles inflation and people can save less then a fall in demand would not come as a surprise. Yet one of the defining economic themes of the UK\u2019s last decade has been the way that house prices have defied apparent economic gravity. Rics said \u201chouse prices continue to rise across the UK\u201d, with a balance of 63% of respondents reporting that prices increased. Tarrant Parsons, Rics\u2019s senior economist said: Amid a backdrop of sharply rising living costs, slowing economic growth and higher interest rates, it is little surprise that housing market activity is now losing some momentum. With monetary policy set to be tightened further over the coming months, sales expectations point to a further softening in transaction volumes going forward. Nevertheless, with respect to house prices, limited supply available is still seen as a crucial factor underpinning the market. Although house price growth is likely to continue to ease, respondents still anticipate prices will be modestly higher than current levels in a year\u2019s time.\n\n\n\n4d ago 09.26 Another sign that inflationary pressures in the US economy may have peaked: the average price of US retail gasoline fell below $4 per gallon on Thursday. The national average price for regular unleaded petrol fell to $3.990 a gallon on 11 August, according to the American Automobile Association\u2019s price tracker. That is down from $4.68 a month ago, and above $5 in mid-June. Rising petrol prices have been an important part of the inflationary story around the world, as many people outside urban areas cannot avoid filling up their cars. It filters through to the price of almost everything else via businesses. Fuel subsidies have been used in several countries to cushion the inflationary blow, although many economists and analysts say this can be counterproductive, as it encourages people to continue to buy more fuel. And rich households tend to spend more on fuel, so subsidies help them more. A few more interesting points. Firstly, the American Automobile Association\u2019s map of petrol prices is not a bad proxy for a US election map (albeit with the colour scheme swapped): US petrol prices tend to be higher in Democrat-led states where taxes are higher. Photograph: American Automobile Association Secondly American petrol prices enjoy a huge implicit subsidy: prices are fundamentally lower than many other parts of the world. $4 per gallon \u2013 a pump price level that prompts howls of outrage in the US \u2013 equates to about 87p per litre in British money. That is less than half what British drivers pay, according to the RAC.\n\n\n\n4d ago 08.36 The FTSE 100 leaders this morning are Ladbrokes owner Entain and Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, both of which have given their shareholders positives amid a tricky macro environment. Coca-Cola HBC, one of the biggest owners of a bottling franchise for US-based Coca-Cola, gained 3.6% after it forecast operating profits in 2022 similar to 2021 \u2013 even after reporting a \u20ac190m (\u00a3160m) hit from its Russian business, after it stopped selling Coke products following the invasion of Ukraine. Gambling company Entain said it is buying a Croatia\u2019s SuperSport Group bookmaker in a growth drive, and its profits (otherwise known as customers\u2019 gambling losses) were up 20% on a year earlier. Its share price rose by 2.2%.\n\n",

                "text": "Eugene Zhang, founding partner of Silicon Valley VC firm TSVC Spencer Greene, general partner of TSVC Courtesy: TSVC\n\nEugene Zhang, a veteran Silicon Valley investor, recalls the exact moment the market for young startups peaked this year. The firehose of money from venture capital firms, hedge funds and wealthy families pouring into seed-stage companies was reaching absurd levels, he said. A company that helps startups raise money had an oversubscribed round at a preposterous $80 million valuation. In another case, a tiny software firm with barely $50,000 in revenue got a $35 million valuation. But that was before the turmoil that hammered publicly traded tech giants in late 2021 began to reach the smallest and most speculative of startups. The red-hot market suddenly cooled, with investors dropping out in the middle of funding rounds, leaving founders high and dry, Zhang said. As the balance of power in the startup world shifts back to those holding the purse strings, the industry has settled on a new math that founders need to accept, according to Zhang and others. \"The first thing you need to do is forget about your classmates at Stanford who raised money at [2021] valuations,\" Zhang says to founders, he told CNBC in a recent Zoom interview. \"We tell them to just forget the past three years happened, go back to 2019 or 2018 before the pandemic,\" he said. That amounts to valuations roughly 40% to 50% off the recent peak, according to Zhang.\n\n'Out of control'\n\nThe painful adjustment rippling through Silicon Valley is a lesson in how much luck and timing can affect the life of a startup \u2014 and the wealth of founders. For more than a decade, larger and larger sums of money have been thrown at companies across the startup spectrum, inflating the value of everything from tiny prerevenue outfits to still-private behemoths like SpaceX. The low interest rate era following the 2008 financial crisis spawned a global search for yield, blurring the lines between various kinds of investors as they all increasingly sought returns in private companies. Growth was rewarded, even if it was unsustainable or came with poor economics, in the hopes that the next Amazon or Tesla would emerge. The situation reached a fever pitch during the pandemic, when \"tourist\" investors from hedge funds, and other newcomers, piled into funding rounds backed by name-brand VCs, leaving little time for due diligence before signing a check. Companies doubled and tripled valuations in months, and unicorns became so common that the phrase became meaningless. More private U.S. companies hit at least $1 billion in valuation last year than in the previous half-decade combined. \"It was kind of out of control in the last three years,\" Zhang said. The beginning of the end of the party came in September, when shares of pandemic winners including PayPal and Block began to plunge as investors anticipated the start of Federal Reserve interest rate increases. Next hit were the valuations of pre-IPO companies, including Instacart and Klarna, which plunged by 38% and 85% respectively, before the doldrums eventually reached down to the early-stage startups.\n\nDeep cuts\n\nHard as they are for founders to accept, valuation haircuts have become standard across the industry, according to Nichole Wischoff, a startup executive turned VC investor. \"Everyone's saying the same thing: `What's normal now is not what you saw the last two or three years,'\" Wischoff said. \"The market is kind of marching together saying, `Expect a 35% to 50% valuation decrease from the last couple of years. That's the new normal, take it or leave it.'\" Beyond the headline-grabbing valuation cuts, founders are also being forced to accept more onerous terms in funding rounds, giving new investors more protections or more aggressively diluting existing shareholders. Not everyone has accepted the new reality, according to Zhang, a former engineer who founded venture firm TSVC in 2010. The outfit made early investments in eight unicorns, including Zoom and Carta. It typically holds onto its stakes until a company IPOs, although it sold some positions in December ahead of the expected downturn. \"Some people don't listen; some people do,\" Zhang said. \"We work with the people who listen, because it doesn't matter if you raised $200 million and later on your company dies; nobody will remember you.\" Along with his partner Spencer Greene, Zhang has seen boom-and-bust cycles since before 2000, a perspective that today's entrepreneurs lack, he said. Founders who have to raise money in coming months need to test existing investors' appetite, stay close to customers and in some cases make deep job cuts, he said. \"You have to take painful measures and be proactive instead of just passively assuming that money will show up someday,\" Zhang said.\n\nA good vintage?",

It is less efficient than simply eliminating deductions or raising the corporate tax rate and could open the door for companies to find new ways to make their income appear lower to reduce their tax bills.\n\nSimilar versions of the idea have been floated by Mr. Biden during his presidential campaign and by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts. They have been promoted as a way to restore fairness to a tax system that has allowed major corporations to dramatically lower their tax bills through deductions and other accounting measures.\n\nAccording to an early estimate from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, the tax would most likely apply to about 150 companies annually, and the bulk of them would be manufacturers. That spurred an outcry from manufacturing companies and Republicans, who have been opposed to any policies that scale back the tax cuts that they enacted five years ago.\n\nAlthough many Democrats acknowledge that the corporate minimum tax was not their first choice of tax hikes, they have embraced it as a political winner. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, shared Joint Committee on Taxation data on Thursday indicating that in 2019, about 100 to 125 corporations reported financial statement income greater than $1 billion, yet their effective tax rates were lower than 5 percent. The average income reported on financial statements to shareholders was nearly $9 billion, but they paid an average effective tax rate of just 1.1 percent.\n\n\u201cCompanies are paying rock-bottom rates while reporting record profits to their shareholders,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.",

Because we're not just dealing with economic issues like inflation and lapping stimulus and things like that. But also the social issues of people returning to mobility after lockdown, working from home and just the change in consumer patterns.\"\n\nThree months earlier, during the company's prior call with analysts, Gibbs said economists who call this a \"K-shaped recovery,\" where high-income consumers are doing fine while lower-income householders struggle, are oversimplifying the situation.\n\n\"I don't know in my career we've seen a more complex environment to analyze consumer behavior than what we're dealing with right now,\" he said in May, citing inflation, rising wages and federal stimulus spending that's still stoking the economy.\n\nAt the same time, societal issues like the post-Covid reopening and Russia's war in Ukraine are weighing on consumer sentiment, which all \"makes for a pretty complex environment to figure out how to analyze it and market to consumers,\" Gibbs said.\n\nGibbs is right. Things are very strange. Is a recession coming or not?\n\nThere is ample evidence for the \"yes\" camp.\n\nTech and finance are bracing for a downturn with hiring slowdowns and job cuts and pleas for more efficiency from workers. The stock market has been on a nine-month slump with the tech-heavy Nasdaq off more than 20% from its November peak and many high-flying tech stocks down 60% or more.\n\nInflation is causing consumers to spend less on nonessential purchases like clothing so they can afford gas and food.

                "text": "Pay rises could fall behind inflation by almost 8% later this year, marking the biggest fall in real wages for 100 years, according to analysis by the TUC.\n\nThe TUC said a prediction by the Bank of England that inflation would jump to 13% in the fourth quarter of this year at a time when wages were expected to increase by just 5.25% meant living standards would fall by an unprecedented 7.75%.\n\nThe figure was calculated by looking at the impact of inflation on workers\u2019 living standards using the latest Bank forecasts. The TUC said that workers had not suffered such a severe and prolonged decline in wages relative to inflation since the 1920s.\n\nTens of thousands of workers have signalled that they are prepared to strike after a series of ballots for industrial action.\n\nMore than 115,000 UK postal workers are to stage a series of strikes later this month after they rejected a pay offer worth up to 5.5%. They could soon be joined by up to 480,000 nurses after the Royal College of Nursing urged its members to back strike action in support of a pay claim for 5% above June\u2019s 11.8% retail prices index (RPI) measure of inflation.\n\nMinisters offered nurses a 3% pay award with a top-up for senior nurses to 4%. But the RCN, which has increased its strike fund by \u00a315m to \u00a350m, said: \u201cThis leaves an experienced nurse over \u00a31,000 worse off in real terms.\u201d\n\nThe Bank of England revamped its forecasts for inflation this winter to a peak of 13% after energy experts said the price cap on average household bills would increase to \u00a33,600 in October and may go up to as much as \u00a34,200 in January 2023. In recent days, estimates have signalled the average bill could rise to as much as \u00a35,000 next year.\n\nBusinesses are also under pressure from soaring energy bills, which the Bank said were mostly being passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nPay rises are expected to account for only 20% of inflation after remaining subdued through the autumn and winter at about 5.25%.\n\nThe TUC said the combination of pay rises about one percentage point above the pre-pandemic level of 4% and double-digit inflation amounted to \u201cthe largest decline for exactly a century\u201d.\n\n\u201cReal pay has fallen by more on only one occasion, a decline of 13.3% in the fourth quarter of 1922 \u2013 as the post first world war pay and price inflation went sharply into reverse. The only other comparable figure was 7.2% in the first quarter of 1940.\u201d\n\nThe TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cDespite the dire pay forecast and surging prices, the Conservatives still don\u2019t seem to recognise that we\u2019re in a crisis that needs an emergency response.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the government to get round the table with trade union and business leaders to find a solution \u2013 not wait another month while the Conservative party finishes electing its leader.\u201d\n\nShe said large businesses could also accept lower profits by refusing to pass on all the higher costs they face.\n\nOfficial figures show that average total pay growth has fallen for the last two months to 6.2%. Experts said the level of pay growth was exaggerated during the City bonus period between February and April, when investment banks traditionally offer staff large one-off pay awards.\n\nThe TUC said total pay in the finance and insurance sector was 13.6% in the year to May 2022 once bonuses were included, down marginally from the recent peak of 15.4% in the year to March.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn March 2022, City bonuses were at their highest cash level on record,\u201d the report said and pushed the gap between total pay and pay without bonuses to 2.8 percentage points \u2013 its largest on record.\n\nO\u2019Grady said: \u201cThe government must also get the economy back in balance again. Too much goes into profits and to those who are already wealthy, and too little goes into wages and to working families.\n\n\u201cTo change this, working people need stronger bargaining power to get a fair share of the wealth they produce. A great approach would be the introduction of industry-wide fair pay agreements.\u201d",

                "text": "Customers are socially distanced on rides like the Wonder Woman: Lasso of Truth at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey.\n\nCheck out the companies making headlines in midday trading.\n\nSix Flags \u2014 Shares dropped 18.7% after the theme park company sharply missed second-quarter earnings expectations. Six Flags reported earnings of 53 cents per share on revenue of $435 million. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv forecast earnings of $1.01 per share on revenue of $519 million. The theme park operator attributed the miss to weak attendance, or a 22% drop in visitors.\n\nWalt Disney \u2013 Disney shares jumped 4.68% after the company posted better-than-expected results for the quarter on the top and bottom lines, helped by strong attendance at its theme parks and better-than-expected streaming numbers. The company also revealed a new pricing structure for its streaming service that includes an ad-supported tier.\n\nPharma stocks \u2013Shares of Pfizer, GSK and Sanofi slipped 3.32%, 6.71% and 3.94% respectively as investors watched ongoing litigation around Zantac, a recalled heartburn medication. The drug was pulled from shelves in 2020 after the Food and Drug Administration found an impurity in Sanfoli's version that could cause cancer.\n\nRalph Lauren \u2013 Shares of Ralph Lauren climbed 3.77%, continuing a rally that began after the company reported earnings earlier in the week that beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines.\n\nBank stocks \u2013 Shares of Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan gained more than 1% Thursday, outperforming the broader market. The stocks may have been boosted by easing concerns about a recession after a second soft inflation report in a row.\n\nOil stocks \u2013 Oil and energy companies led the S&P 500 on Thursday, supported by a jump in crude futures. Devon Energy jumped 7.34%, notching the best performance in the index midday.\n\nVacasa \u2014Shares of Vacasa jumped 33.22% after the vacation rental services company boosted its full-year outlook, citing a surge in demand. The company also posted a quarterly profit, surprising Wall Street.\n\nWarby Parker \u2013 Shares of Warby Parker surged 19.18% after reporting earnings before the bell. The eyewear retailer, which cut its financial forecast for the year, posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss and sales in-line with analysts' estimates. It also cut 63 jobs.\n\nBumble \u2013 Shares of the dating app dropped 8.61% after the company cut its annual revenue forecast. Bumble posted a negative impact of $9.4 million from foreign currency movements year over year. Meanwhile, its Badoo app and other revenue declined by double digits.\n\nCardinal Health \u2013 Shares of Cardinal Health jumped 5.18% after the company reported mixed quarterly earnings. The pharma company's earnings beat Wall Street estimates, but revenue fell short. The company also announced its CEO Mike Kaufmann would step down Sept. 1 and be replaced by its CFO Jason Hollar.\n\nSonos \u2013Shares of the maker of high-end speakers slid 24.95% after the company missed expectations on the top and bottom lines. Sonos also cut its full-year guidance amid the challenging economic backdrop and announced the upcoming departure of its current chief financial officer.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Samantha Subin, Michelle Fox, Yun Li, Sarah Min and Tanaya Macheel contributed reporting",

But the still-blistering pace of hiring and wage growth means the Federal Reserve may need to act more decisively to restrain the economy as it seeks to wrestle inflation under control.\n\nFed officials have been waiting for signs that the economy, and particularly the job market, is slowing. They hope that employers\u2019 voracious need for workers will come into balance with the supply of available applicants, because that would take pressure off wages, in turn paving the way for businesses like restaurants, hotels and retailers to temper their price increases.\n\n\n\nThe moderation has remained elusive, and that could keep central bankers raising interest rates rapidly in an effort to cool down the economy and restrain the fastest inflation in four decades.

                "text": "Initial claims for unemployment insurance totaled 260,000 last week, near the highest level since November amid a shift in the U.S. labor market. The total for the week ended July 30 was in line with the Dow Jones estimate but a gain of 6,000 from the previous week's downwardly revised level, the Labor Department reported Thursday. In other economic news, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services decreased to $79.6 billion in June, down $5.3 billion and slightly lower than the estimate for $80 billion. The jobless claims number comes a day before the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its much anticipated nonfarm payrolls report for July. That is expected the show the U.S. economy added 258,000 positions in the month, compared with the 372,000 initial June estimate and the lowest total since December 2020.\n\nA sign for hire is posted on the window of a Chipotle restaurant in New York, April 29, 2022. Shannon Stapleton | Reuters\n\n\"The labor market remains in good shape as the summer quarter progresses but the rise in initial claims since early April is a cold breeze blowing at the hot labor market this summer,\" said Stuart Hoffman, senior economic advisor at PNC Financial Services. Federal Reserve officials are watching the jobs market closely for clues about an economy that is showing the highest inflation rate in more than 40 years. Jobless claims had been running around their lowest levels since the late 1960s but started ticking higher in June as inflation pressures swelled and companies started cutting back on hires. Even with robust hiring in 2021 and the first half of 2022, the total employment level is 755,000 below where it was in February 2020, the last month before the Covid pandemic hit. The four-week moving average of jobless claims, which smooths out weekly volatility, reflects the shift in the jobs market. That number rose 6,000 from the previous week to 254,750, up sharply from the recent low of 170,500 on April 2 and the highest level of the year. Continuing claims, which run a week behind the headline number, totaled 1.42 million, up 48,000 from the prior week and 83,000 from the beginning of July.\n\nTrade deficit comes off record high",

                "text": "What goes up must come down. Right? Inflation has been soaring over the last year. But price rises in July were \u201cjust\u201d 8.5% higher than what they were last July, down from a 9.1% yearly rate in June. Perhaps the worst is over?\n\nAmericans have been feeling the hit at the gas pump, grocery stores, restaurants and when planning vacations. In response, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates from near zero to between 2.25% and 2.5% as it tries to drive inflation down to its target rate of 2%, but it is unclear when that goal can be reached.\n\nWhat is clear is that when and if prices do start to fall, it is going to take time, and in some sectors, a lot more time than in others. Nor is declining overall inflation a guarantee that prices will not rise in some areas again.\n\nGas and energy\n\nThe energy sector, particularly gasoline prices, have played a huge role in soaring inflation rates. Compared to last year, energy prices were up 41% in June and gas prices alone were up 60%.\n\nThere are signs of relief, at least in the near future. The gasoline index fell 7.7% in July, the labor department reported on Wednesday. After peaking at $5 a gallon nationally in the beginning of summer, gas prices finally started to come down in June. Gas is now under $4 a gallon in over 19 states as demand has softened over the last few weeks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen demand begin to come down as gas prices got so expensive earlier this summer,\u201d said Sarah House, a managing director and senior economist at Wells Fargo. \u201cIt began to change behavior.\u201d\n\nAmericans are using less gas this summer: gas consumption in the US is now over 1m barrels a day below levels that were seen in the summer of 2020, which was already lower than what was seen pre-pandemic, according to federal government stats.\n\nDespite falling demand, it is still unclear how long the low gas prices will last. The energy market is extremely volatile. Some analysts have warned that gas prices could go up again in the fall as stricter sanctions against Russian oil are set to start in December. The Opec cartel of oil-producing nations agreed to an increase in oil output that is, seemingly in a snub to Joe Biden, their smallest increase ever.\n\n\u201cWe still have fairly elevated oil prices, and we\u2019re still looking at a market that\u2019s pretty tight. There\u2019s not a lot of spare capacity out there,\u201d House said.\n\nFood\n\nLike the energy market, the food sector is highly volatile as it is also sensitive to geopolitical relations and climate. The food index increased 10.9% over the last year, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending May 1979.\n\nA number of factors went into rising food prices, including a highly infectious avian flu that wiped out many chickens across the country. Tyson Foods, one of the largest meat producers in America, said that labor shortages and higher grain prices played a role in rising meat prices.\n\nBut there might be some relief coming. The price of major food commodities like corn and wheat have started to go down \u2013 at the end of July, Ukraine started exporting grain for the first time since the war \u2013 but it will take some time for the lowering of those prices to appear, if at all.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing that the upstream prices of corn and wheat have gone back to where they were prior to the war, but it takes a while for those products to go through the next stage of production,\u201d said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College. \u201cIt has to be shipped and then stocked at the grocery stores, so [the price decreases are] probably going to take a little bit longer.\u201d\n\nEasing has already been seen in the price of beef and pork, which declined starting in June, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. As a result, prices in meats, poultry, fish and egg markets have also declined.\n\nVehicles\n\nThe pandemic induced a shortage of semiconductor chips, which are used in everything from phones to TVs to cars, that is still being seen today.\n\nThe shortage is squeezing the car industry. Analysts are predicting that the low number of new car sales, which dropped 12% year-over-year in July, will continue through the end of summer as the supply of cars continues to be sparse. The average price for a new car hit a record $48,000 in June, according to Cox Automative.\n\nIn July, Americans were paying 10.4% more for new vehicles and 6.6% more for used cars compared with the year before. That\u2019s a dramatic fall from earlier this year. In January used cars were 44.6% higher than they were at the start or 2021. But it still means prices are rising, and from a high base.\n\nThough the chip shortage does not affect the used car market directly, fewer new cars means people are holding on to their cars rather than buying new ones, tightening the used car market.\n\nThe Senate just passed a bipartisan bill that provides $52bn in subsidies to chip manufacturers in the US and investment into developing a more robust domestic chip industry, though any impact from the bill on the car industry will not be seen for some time. Though used car prices showed signs of easing early in the summer, they still remain historically high and will probably remain so for the near future.\n\nHousing\n\nWhen the Fed dropped interest rates to near zero at the beginning of the pandemic, mortgage rates came crashing down, reaching a historic low of below 3%.\n\nWith borrowing for a new home being cheaper than ever, and people looking to move to bigger spaces as they worked from home, the housing market boomed. The median sales price of existing homes climbed from $355,000 in May 2021 to $407,600 in May 2022 \u2013 the highest average sale price in history. The average price of rent in June went up 5.8% over the previous year.\n\nSince the Fed raised interest rates from 2.25 to 2.5%, mortgages have gotten more expensive. A 30-year fixed mortgage is now nearly 6% \u2013 nearly double what it was just a year ago.\n\nAs a result, the housing market is starting to cool. Prices are still high, but they are starting to come down. Double the number of homes have a price reduction compared with last year, and while rent is still going up, increases are slowing.\n\nThe Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, noted in June that inventory in the housing market is still low, \u201cso it\u2019s still a very tight market\u201d. The cooling in the market is \u201ca bit of a reset\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cEven though, directionally, things are improving, there\u2019s still a long way to go,\u201d House, the Wells Fargo economist, said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to keep the Fed on an aggressive path where it\u2019s not going to be easy to get inflation all the way back to 2%.\u201d\n\nSo \u2026 now what?\n\nEconomists say that it is possible that inflation has hit its peak, and there are good signs that many of the pressures behind inflation are easing, but it is still hard to predict the path that inflation will take.\n\nSome of the prices being seen today, like for gas and homes, will probably continue to go down. But other costs will, in a best-case scenario, stay put.\n\n\u201cWhat price normalization for a lot of individuals would mean would be for the good that they\u2019re used to buying, they go back to the prices they were used to paying,\u201d said Tara Sinclair, a professor of economics at George Washington University. \u201cBut that\u2019s not really feasible. It\u2019s much easier to accept that these new higher prices, on average \u2026 are here to stay.\u201d\n\nSinclair added that deflation \u2013 the decrease of prices \u2013 is a phenomenon that is actually \u201cassociated with really bad economic performances\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed were to target deflation, we would then see massive job losses, a high unemployment rate,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s just too high a cost to pay.\u201d\n\nThe process of taming inflation is unpleasant. Fewer people can afford to buy houses or new cars, and businesses have less money to expand. But getting inflation down is necessary for the economy to get back to a healthy balance between supply and demand, Sinclair said.\n\n\u201cWe might need to endure this painful medicine now in order to get the economy on a nice, good footing for the long term,\u201d she said.",

                "text": "In January 2020, Glenn Youngkin, now the Republican governor of Virginia, got some welcome news. A complex corporate transaction had gone through at the Carlyle Group, the powerful private equity company that Youngkin led as co-chief executive. Under the deal, approved by the Carlyle board and code-named \"Project Phoenix,\" he began receiving $8.5 million worth of Carlyle stock, tax-free, according to court documents.\n\nThe Project Phoenix payout came on top of $54 million in compensation Youngkin had received from Carlyle during the previous two years, regulatory records show. Youngkin retired from Carlyle on Sept. 30, 2020; he won the governor's election in November 2021.\n\nYoungkin was not alone in receiving the 2020 windfall, according to the court documents. Eight other wealthy Carlyle officials received over $200 million worth of company shares in the deal, tax-free and paid for by the company. David M. Rubenstein, Carlyle's billionaire founder and co-chairman, received $70.5 million worth.\n\nNow, that transaction is under attack by a Carlyle shareholder in Delaware Chancery Court. The suit, filed last week by the city of Pittsburgh Comprehensive Municipal Pension Trust Fund, says the $344 million deal harmed Carlyle's stockholders, who received nothing in return when they funded the payday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Carlyle insiders who received the payouts escaped a tax bill that would have exceeded $1 billion, according to the complaint, which accuses Rubenstein, Youngkin and other Carlyle officials of lining their own pockets at the expense of people like police officers and firefighters.\n\n\"The kind of impunity that Carlyle's control group acted with is shocking and unacceptable,\" lawyers for the Pittsburgh pension fund said in their complaint.\n\n\"The beneficiaries of the city of Pittsburgh Comprehensive Municipal Pension Trust Fund are municipal fire and police personnel serving the city of Pittsburgh. Many are first responders putting their lives on the line every day. They depend on the integrity of the financial markets to provide for their retirement.\"\n\nThe Carlyle payout exemplifies the private equity industry's laser focus on avoiding tax bills.\n\nPrivate equity investors already receive special tax treatment on their earnings, under what is known as the carried interest loophole. Much of their income is taxed at 20%, far below the 37% maximum paid by high-earning salaried workers. Initially, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which just passed the Senate, had narrowed the loophole's benefits, but the change disappeared at the insistence of Kyrsten Sinema, the holdout Democratic senator from Arizona, according to news reports.\n\nA Sinema spokeswoman told CNBC that she \"makes every decision based on one criteria: what's best for Arizona.\"\n\nCarlyle's 2020 $344 million tax-free payout to its insiders cited in the lawsuit is a new twist on a type of contract known as a tax receivable agreement, or TRA. Companies and their founders typically create such agreements in conjunction with initial public offerings of the companies' shares.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, TRA payouts can be a win-win for both a company and its insiders, market participants say, because both parties get something of value \u2014 the insiders get stock, and the company gets a tax benefit when they sell it.\n\nBut in a highly unusual move that was unfair to Carlyle's shareholders, lawyers for the Pittsburgh pension fund say, Carlyle structured its payout as tax-free, generating no tax benefits to the company even as it enriched insiders. The tax-free payout was \"an extreme outlier\" among such agreements, and it was designed by the Carlyle insiders \"to maximize the benefits for themselves in every possible way, to the detriment of the company and the public stockholders,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nAsked to respond to the lawsuit's allegations, a spokesperson for Youngkin provided this statement: \"When Mr. Youngkin was a member of Carlyle's leadership, the Carlyle board and an independent special committee retained independent experts and advisors to consider and approve a transaction that had significant benefits for the company and its shareholders. The plaintiff's allegations are baseless and will be vigorously defended against.\"\n\nA Carlyle spokeswoman said in a statement: \"Carlyle was the first U.S. private equity firm to convert to a one share one vote, best-in-class governance model creating better alignment with public shareholders who now have a greater vote and voice.\"\n\nRubenstein, through a spokesman, declined to comment.\n\nLawyers representing the Pittsburgh pension declined to comment further on the suit.\n\nAndy Lee, a New York City-based asset manager who is not involved in the suit, expressed concerns to NBC News about the details it outlined.\n\n\"If the allegations are true, we would discourage such behavior on the part of management,\" said Lee, the chief investment officer of Parallaxes Capital, a financial firm that buys TRAs. \"They are supposed to represent the interests of public shareholders.\"",
